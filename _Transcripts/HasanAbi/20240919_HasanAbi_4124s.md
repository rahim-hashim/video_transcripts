**HasanAbi:** [September 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg)
*  Marky Mark likes posting. Okay. He likes posting and he likes gooning. He is a massive gooner [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=0.0s)]
*  Okay, a real freak a real freak now Marcus Jebediah [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=7.0600000000000005s)]
*  Robinson had a problem. He liked gooning a little too much and [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=13.3s)]
*  Inevitably all of that gooning got him caught [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=17.22s)]
*  Anyway, let's do let's do it man. Let's do Mark Robinson. Let's get to it. Okay [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=25.2s)]
*  All right, Mark Robinson is down bad. Ladies and gentlemen for the oh, this was actually what I wanted to show you. Sorry [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=30.28s)]
*  Here's actually a good congressperson where you said quote Haiti is so screwed up because it wasn't colonized long enough end quote [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=36.92s)]
*  Is that correct? Did you say that? I'm happy to talk about that all you did say it. That's right [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=44.32s)]
*  Yes, you said that Haiti was colonized as a plantation [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  country colony the French colonized Haiti so that would work on plantations [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=53.44s)]
*  The end of colonization in Haiti was so that the people there would no longer be [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=60.0s)]
*  So what you're saying and I read your quote and anybody watching this online should go read it [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=65.88s)]
*  What you're saying is it would have been good if they'd stayed colonized [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=71.12s)]
*  Which means that would have been good if they had stayed by the French in the long run [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=74.24s)]
*  It's one of the long run history. No people shouldn't have been in a single day [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=78.56s)]
*  I'm reclaiming my time and they had every right they had every right to throw the what you said [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=82.88s)]
*  One of them reclaiming my time I'm talking would have been free you said it is later [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=87.88000000000001s)]
*  You said they would have been in the same situation [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=92.88000000000001s)]
*  You're saying you wanted 30 more years of in Haiti reclaiming my time [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=94.72000000000001s)]
*  I do just said it honestly it adds up [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=98.2s)]
*  You said that they would have benefited from the French influence the French were the ones like the people in Martinique and reclaiming my time [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=100.76s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, I'd like my time [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=108.68s)]
*  This is my time. Mr. Corcorian. They are much better off. Honestly, this all starts to add up before today [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=111.12s)]
*  I couldn't understand why Trump's project 2025 could add that's such a dude. That's so gross [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=116.32s)]
*  this is like the classic old white guy take which is like, uh [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=122.8s)]
*  If black people hate it so much, why don't they go back to Africa? It's like how do you not even feel? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=127.52s)]
*  Embarrassing like that [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=133.32s)]
*  It's no different than that one chatter coming in earlier and being like if you don't like the USA so much go to Lebanon [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=134.48s)]
*  And it's like we're literally in the process of talking about Lebanon Lebanese civilians being exploded [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=139.32s)]
*  Like what do you mean? Oh if you don't like me up an area [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=145.0s)]
*  Why don't you go to that area that I'm up and die there is not the incredible argument you think you're making [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  Okay, and it's the same bro. This person is so insane. I'm giving them a week off [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=156.4s)]

*  There used to be a little bit of honor and decency in poop socking a streamer [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=183.0s)]
*  Ever since we banned the two-parters at the top of the hour [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=186.84s)]
*  the chat has resorted to worse and worse ways of [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=189.68s)]
*  Changing the outcome of the stream. Okay at the top of the hour. I serve the three minute handbrakes [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=194.68s)]

*  By connecting your Amazon prime account to your twitch account or by getting gifted a sub if you're lucky [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=212.24s)]
*  Here's a three minute break now good times create weak poop sock linkers is true [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=217.2s)]

*  What though am I looking at dude it is imperative that you know thirty percent off six dollars is 420 [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=228.12s)]
*  All right for 20 blaze it goddamn. All right, let's finish rights protections. Why would Trump's project 2025? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=234.24s)]
*  I know there's crazy stuff in here, but I couldn't get why I would advocate for ending protections against discrimination [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=240.24s)]
*  But now I understand we have project 2025 board members here [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=246.72000000000003s)]
*  Who are the directors of groups that the Southern Poverty Law Center has designated as a hate group? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=250.72000000000003s)]
*  We have people that are on the board that the five talked about the Robinson story before me [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=255.82s)]
*  Okay, I got a piss real quick, but interesting and Jessica Tarkov is back. Let's go North Carolina [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=261.5s)]
*  Which is a big target for the Democrats? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=267.5s)]
*  I gotta pee I'll be back [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=269.58s)]
*  We just found out an hour ago that the lieutenant governor there Mark Robinson who's running for governor who Donald Trump called Martin Luther King on [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=270.26s)]
*  steroids posted on a forum called Africa that he's a black express support for reinstating and [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=278.34s)]
*  Detailed his sexual arousal from memories of peeping on women in public gyms, and he still fantasizes about it [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=284.42s)]
*  He also has an Ashley Madison account. How dare you kink shame? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=291.3s)]
*  Sure, that's a great reaction. So [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=295.58s)]
*  Josh Stein [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=298.06s)]
*  Was likely to win that race anyway if they get mark Robinson to drop out his name is still on the ballot [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=299.5s)]
*  But this makes North Carolina even more in play for Democrats [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=305.62s)]
*  And this again is evidence of the type of candidate that Donald Trump thinks are good for the country [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=309.5s)]
*  Martin Luther King on steroids someone who says he's a black but he would [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=315.3s)]
*  Take the obvious here. Yeah, do you think Trump actually knew this guy was on porn site? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=321.26s)]
*  My point is that Donald Trump likes anyone who likes him and he doesn't bother to do that [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=325.82s)]
*  No, it's not. I a lot of people like me who I don't like in return like who? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=330.66s)]
*  Like [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=334.8s)]
*  Okay rewatch is disgusting really interesting state in there, North Carolina [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=351.6s)]

*  Do we have a video of the mark Robinson coverage, I don't want to go directly to the article [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=360.32s)]
*  I'm sure CNN has already covered it has it been has it hit the interwebs yet. So here's the situation [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=365.76s)]

*  Robinson had a problem. He liked gooning a little too much and [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=410.64s)]

*  You can be like, oh, that's the old me. You're like, I don't believe that except no he literally defended it [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=643.1s)]

*  People were like hey, we look through your old posts and [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=730.46s)]
*  On Facebook you like openly quoted Adolf Hitler, right? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=735.3000000000001s)]
*  Like what the fuck is that about? That's weird [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=740.4200000000001s)]

*  Oh [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=750.0600000000001s)]
*  History books also quote Adolf Hitler. What am I? I mean, what am I a history book? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=751.3000000000001s)]
*  No, I'm Mark Robinson and also that's a weird way to double down on why you quoted Adolf Hitler [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=755.9s)]
*  He posted this in 2014 on Facebook [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=763.0600000000001s)]
*  He said history who said it number one pride in one's own race and that does not imply [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=765.38s)]
*  Contempt for other races is also a normal and healthy sentiment [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=771.5s)]
*  I have never regarded the Chinese or the Japanese as being inferior to ourselves [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=774.9s)]
*  They have the right to be proud of their past just as we have a right to be proud of the civilization to which we belong [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=779.86s)]
*  the post [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=785.86s)]
*  Which he'd never deleted by the way [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=787.14s)]
*  Was publicly available then at a Moms for Liberty summit in July Robinson fervently defended his choice to quote the leader of the party [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=789.5s)]
*  Implying that doing so without context is not akin to endorsing his words or actions whether you're talking about Adolf Hitler [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=798.1s)]
*  whether you're talking about Chairman Mao or [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=805.62s)]
*  Stalin whether you're talking about Pol Pot or Castro in Cuba or a dozen other despots all around the globe [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=808.14s)]
*  It's time for us to get back and start reading some of those quotes [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=813.94s)]
*  It's time for us to start teaching teaching our children about the dirty [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=816.98s)]
*  Despicable awful things that those communists and socialist despots did in our history except he was quoting Adolf Hitler [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=821.2600000000001s)]
*  He wasn't quoting those guys and he was agreeing with it. So [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=827.62s)]
*  You know [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=830.58s)]
*  It is what it is [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=831.86s)]
*  in other posts Robinson minimized the horrors of the Holocaust [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=833.5s)]
*  Claimed a satanic Marxist had made the movie Black Panther to pull shekels out of black audiences [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=837.26s)]

*  maggots not with the F but with the M which is very interesting because you're right there [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=848.9399999999999s)]
*  Why didn't you just say the other thing like you're right there? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=855.0999999999999s)]
*  This is all the stuff that he this is all the stuff that was readily available before by the way [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=858.42s)]
*  This is part of the reason why this is part of the reason why? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=864.2199999999999s)]
*  He was already very unpopular in the North Carolina governor race just so you understand [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=869.42s)]
*  So the new that has come out on Mark Robinson is just basically [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=875.0999999999999s)]
*  You know repeating the old [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=879.66s)]
*  Yeah, he also expressed our cake views about women's role in society telling a Charlotte area church in 2022 that Christians are called to [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=884.9s)]
*  be led by men [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=891.74s)]
*  God sent women out when they had to do their thing [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=892.9399999999999s)]
*  But when it was time to face down Goliath, he sent David not Davida [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=896.4599999999999s)]
*  David Robinson said at the time and yet Robbins is gubernatorial win would turn the state's executive branch [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=901.3s)]
*  It's last Democratic holdout read effectively locking Democrats out of a state. They had once predicted would be their stronghold in the south [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=906.9s)]
*  Robinson's likely opponent come November will be attorney Josh Stein the Democratic favorite and that is his opponent [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=914.18s)]
*  Josh Stein is also cooking him in the polls even before this new announcement [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=920.54s)]
*  Here it is, by the way, some folks need it's time for somebody to say it [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=925.3s)]
*  You know, it's a time when we used to meet evil on the battlefield and guess what we did to it [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=929.74s)]
*  We we didn't quibble about it. We didn't argue about it. We didn't fight about it [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=934.78s)]
*  We put some liberals somewhere is gonna say that sounds awful too bad get mad at me if you want to [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=938.9399999999999s)]
*  Some folks need it's time for somebody to say it. It's not a matter of vengeance [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=945.3s)]
*  It's not a matter of being mean or spiteful. It's a matter of necessity time to call out those guys in green [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=949.3399999999999s)]
*  Go have him handle who are the guys in the green that he's talking about. So I'm not gonna make fun of him and [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=957.02s)]

*  And he wrote posts expressing support for reinstating [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1419.9399999999998s)]
*  And that's just the stuff we can tell you on television [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1423.86s)]
*  CNN's andrew kaczynski did the digging broke the story and he spoke with lieutenant governor robinson today [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1427.9399999999998s)]

*  Absolutely, who the would write comments on a website [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1447.1999999999998s)]
*  sometimes [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1453.6799999999998s)]
*  When i'm in the midst when i'm in the throes of cranking it, okay? [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1454.98s)]
*  I often have that [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1460.74s)]
*  I often ask that same question. I'm like who the is writing comments and it's always usually like bots, right? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1462.82s)]
*  It's usually just bots [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1469.62s)]
*  turns out [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1471.78s)]
*  Current lieutenant governor of north carolina is the answer to that question [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1473.3799999999999s)]
*  Okay [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1477.78s)]
*  if you are [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1478.8999999999999s)]
*  If you're not only gripping [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1481.06s)]
*  But you're also posting comments on a forum dedicated to you have gone above and beyond [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1483.06s)]
*  Okay, you are a real gooner. I tip my hat to you, sir [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1489.3s)]
*  First tell us what you discovered here [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1496.26s)]
*  jake cnn found a series of highly disturbing posts made on the message board of a website [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1499.14s)]
*  More than a decade ago and we traced them directly to mark robinson [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1505.22s)]
*  We did interview robinson today and he categorically denies making these posts and i'll get to that in just a moment here [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1509.6200000000001s)]
*  But first I want to walk people through just some of them take a look right here at this one in one post [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1516.1000000000001s)]
*  Robinson called himself a quote black and when describing then president barack obama writing [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1522.0s)]
*  I take hitler over any of the that's in washington right now. It even goes beyond that another disturbing post [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1528.5800000000002s)]
*  Robinson defended writing quote is not that bad and I wish they would bring back I would okay [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1536.48s)]
*  There is definitely there's definitely something wrong with like [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1542.66s)]
*  I guess this is like an even more severe [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1549.38s)]
*  version of like what republicans always fantasize about in terms of like what their role would look like in a libertarian [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1552.02s)]
*  dystopia [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1558.48s)]
*  It's like dog you you do ubereats right now [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1559.94s)]
*  What makes you think you would not be a surf? [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1564.26s)]
*  under a [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1567.46s)]
*  Ancap style governance like why do you think things would change for you? [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1568.5s)]
*  And the same question could be presented to mark, which is like dude, you're black [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1573.8600000000001s)]
*  Why do you think you would not immediately be categorically under a white supremacist governance? [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1579.46s)]
*  Like what are you saying? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1586.1000000000001s)]
*  I mean [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1588.9s)]
*  This makes no sense [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1591.78s)]
*  But many people [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1596.9s)]
*  Nod, they said i'm good, but they didn't that's the other side of it. They don't they never do [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1599.38s)]
*  like [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1606.1000000000001s)]
*  I often talk about whiteness as a socio-political construct, right? [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1607.38s)]
*  And it it is especially in the united states of america [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1611.6200000000001s)]
*  It means like proximity to power and whiteness is defined by what it's not and what it's not is black [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1614.02s)]
*  Okay, the one group of people that will never be under the white umbrella [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1620.9s)]
*  Is black people? [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1625.8600000000001s)]
*  It's literally designed [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1627.54s)]
*  To do that outcome to have that outcome. It's the permanent out group [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1630.26s)]
*  So if you're a black man [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1634.98s)]
*  Being like oh man, it's not that bad. Can't wait to buy me some just like no, dude [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1636.98s)]
*  That wouldn't work that way. It would not work that way at all [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1641.22s)]
*  Why do you think it would work that way [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1646.66s)]
*  Certainly buy a few all of these comments and many others that you can read on saying this was on a black site [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1649.22s)]
*  Oh my [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1655.94s)]
*  Oh my god [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1657.22s)]
*  And cnn.com were made on the message board of a website called africa and jake in addition to those posts [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1660.74s)]
*  He also expressed views on africa that sharply contradicts his current policies as a socially conservative [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1667.22s)]
*  For governor, for example, he has been [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1674.26s)]
*  Vocally anti-transgender but look at what robinson wrote on the message board more than a decade ago [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1676.8s)]
*  Writing that he quote liked watching transgender adding quote. That's effing hot and called himself a quote perv [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1682.34s)]
*  He's a chaser [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1695.14s)]
*  Bro classic [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1698.18s)]

*  Oh my god [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1706.26s)]
*  Also k-phile. What are you saying? That doesn't mean he's pro, you know, that don't mean he's pro trans dude [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1708.34s)]
*  That just means he's a chaser [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1713.6200000000001s)]
*  A lot of a lot of transphobes are alex jones comes to mind [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1715.78s)]
*  In another thread that was discussing who said she was raped by her taxi driver while drunk [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1720.9s)]
*  Robinson wrote quote and the moral of this story don't eff a drunk white [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1726.3400000000001s)]
*  So he wrote all of this [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1731.7s)]
*  stuff [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1734.98s)]
*  Years ago before he got into politics. How are you sure that it's him? [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1735.78s)]
*  Yeah, so cnn jake we found that robinson consistently used that same username [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1740.66s)]
*  Mini soldier that he used on africa in all of his social media. You can see it here. He used it on pinterest black planet [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1745.54s)]
*  YouTube he even used it as his twitter handle [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1752.8999999999999s)]
*  His full name was also listed on africa and an email we found he used on africa [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1756.5s)]
*  He used on several other websites now the biographical data from multiple websites using the name mini soldier matches robinson [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1763.1399999999999s)]
*  Exactly the exact date of birth his home date of birth [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1770.8999999999999s)]
*  Exactly the exact date of birth his hometown the fact that his mother worked at an hbcu [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1773.46s)]

*  And of course, this was all before he was a public figure [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1782.74s)]
*  Which would factor into the the identification that this all happened back [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1786.66s)]
*  Oh my god [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1791.38s)]
*  This is like when gray names come into chat and say some unhinged and then m hud finds out like [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1792.5800000000002s)]
*  Their current geographical location in like under 30 seconds [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1798.8200000000002s)]
*  And then we look at their tweets and they're like defending pedophilia. It's like these people have no opsec, dude [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1803.7s)]
*  They have no opsec whatsoever. They just straight up are [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1810.02s)]
*  Out there. They're just out there living their lives saying some insane unhinged and with not a care [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1813.38s)]
*  With not a care about who sees it then when he was just a common citizen [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1821.54s)]
*  So what did lieutenant governor [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1826.26s)]
*  Robinson have to say about all this today when you talk to him [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1828.9s)]
*  So robinson calls the story trash. He says it's not him [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1831.94s)]
*  We asked the campaign for comment [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1835.3799999999999s)]
*  We gave them 48 hours to respond that deadline was this morning and that's when lieutenant governor robinson agreed to do a brief interview [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1836.9s)]

*  Do you deny that this account is you well first off? [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=1853.8600000000001s)]

*  And i'm talking about your state on the hasanabi broadcast [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=3946.12s)]
*  Understand that something horrible has probably taken place in your state. Okay, this stream is honestly toxic [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=3950.74s)]
*  That's crazy that you're saying that it gives me when he starts bragging about her huge clit like it's the perfect inverse of it [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=3958.2799999999997s)]

*  Uh, you all have seen the half-truths and outright lies of josh stein on these ads over and over again [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=3990.68s)]

*  Let me reassure you the things that you will see in that story. Those are not the words of mark robinson [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=4002.6s)]
*  You know my words, you know my character and those are the words of mini soldier who also happens to be mark robinson [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=4009.3999999999996s)]

*  You know what? I mean? Like you should have just not even said half truths. You know what I mean? And before [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=4028.84s)]
*  uh folks this race right now [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=4034.28s)]
*  Our opponents are desperate to shift the focus here from the substantive issues [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=4037.2400000000002s)]
*  And focus on what you are concerned with to salacious trap tabloid trash [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=4042.28s)]
*  We cannot allow that to happen and folks I do want to take a moment and recognize [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=4047.4s)]
*  That as much as we are making fun of this big boy [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=4054.6000000000004s)]
*  He has demonstrated [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=4057.6400000000003s)]
*  Incredible restraint after all [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=4060.26s)]
*  He is obviously a massive anti-semite and he's running against a jewish dude and he is not once [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=4062.92s)]
*  As far as we know on camera said some anti-semitic about his opponent [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=4070.52s)]
*  so that [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=4076.76s)]
*  Requires a tremendous amount of restraint from a man who very very simply put has none of it [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=4077.94s)]
*  Okay [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=4084.84s)]
*  He does not have a single like a like a single fraction of restraint when it comes to gooning [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=4085.6400000000003s)]
*  It seems [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=4092.28s)]
*  Because not many have gone into debt [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=4093.4s)]
*  Okay, this is a man who has openly quoted hitler and yet he yet he hasn't said something openly anti-semitic thus far [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=4097.56s)]
*  Which is shocking. Do you think the jews trump is talking to today? We'll ask him about this. No, that'd be pretty funny [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=4105.16s)]
*  Oh my god, please. Oh my god [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=4111.88s)]
*  Wait, when was that supposed to happen? Was that supposed to happen at three? Did we miss that? [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=4115.0s)]
*  Because I really wanted to see I really wanted to see what kind of incredible stuff. Oh, he's live right now [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrppcWfQeJg&t=4118.92s)]
