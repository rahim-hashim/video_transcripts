# I Got Into Trouble On The Way To D.C
**HasanAbi:** [April 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4)
*  But here's the thing. We got stuck behind a police chase. We got stuck behind a police [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=0.0s)]
*  chase and it was one of the funniest places to get stuck into because it's right on. Like [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=6.58s)]
*  this is Los Inacos Boulevard, like near LAX and there's nowhere to go. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=12.58s)]
*  Fantastic afternoon, fantastic pre noon, no matter where you are in the world. I'm a song [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=20.34s)]
*  Piker in this thoughts on a broadcast coming to you live from perhaps one of the most evil [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=27.96s)]
*  places that has ever existed in the history of mankind. It brings me no pleasure to repeat, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=35.22s)]
*  to report to you that I am live and alive from Washington, DC, the nation's capital, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=41.84s)]
*  one of the most violent, one of the most evil countries on the planet, Washington, DC, ladies [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=45.92s)]
*  and gentlemen, boys, girls and enbies. We are live. We are alive and I hope everyone's [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=53.44s)]
*  having a fantastic one because today's a beautiful day. Today's a wonderful day. Today is April 5th. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=56.8s)]
*  That's right. It's April 5th, 2025. And once again, I am, I'm doing the damn thing. I'm live. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  I'm alive. And this is part of the broadcast where I tell you about my personal news. Now, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=69.44s)]
*  of course, some of you might say a nice cook chair. And to you, I will say yes, as you know, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=72.32s)]
*  big part of what we do here is I travel the nation. Sometimes I travel around the world [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=80.16s)]
*  and I make the best usage of the cup chairs in every hotel room. This is probably one of the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=86.8s)]
*  nicest cup chairs I've ever sat inside of. You look like you're ready to do a YouTube video [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=92.4s)]
*  apology. Yeah, I'm not though I am. There's no, there's nothing to apologize for. I'm not, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=96.08s)]
*  I'm not here to apologize to nobody and nothing. I, this is a part of the broadcast where I tell [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=104.0s)]
*  you about my personal, wait, what? All right. This is part of the broadcast where I tell you [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=110.88s)]
*  about my personal news, about what's going on in the world of the song house. And I would fight [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=115.28s)]
*  green between time period where I press the stop streaming button and press the start streaming [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=119.04s)]
*  button. So help me God. And that's precisely what I'm going to do. So yeah, I'm in DC. You guys are [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=122.08s)]
*  probably still going to ask, why are you in DC? Even though I said why I was going to be in DC [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=131.12s)]
*  for the past week. Also my favorite will be the people that come into the chat today to go, Hey [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=138.08s)]
*  Assan, why aren't you covering the DC rally? There's a massive pro Palestinian rally that is at DC. Why [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=146.16s)]
*  aren't you covering it? And that'll be very funny to see in the chat while I'm literally at the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  rally. So, you know, very, very excited about all of that stupid foolishness. But yeah, yesterday [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=160.88s)]
*  ended the broadcast and I spent some time with my dad trying to tell him what to do with Kaia in my [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=168.72s)]
*  absence. He basically was like, I'm not going to do any of that. He was like, there's just very little [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=175.84s)]
*  chance that I'm going to be able to do any of the things that you're requiring of me. So Kaia's [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=183.6s)]
*  training is probably going to get broken in the next two days that I'm away from home. So I hope, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=188.8s)]
*  you know, I hope it's not beyond repair, but aside from that, everything's going to be fine. So [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=194.4s)]
*  make sure to not drink too much liquids because no public bathrooms. Yeah, I know. I already, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=203.60000000000002s)]
*  I already messed up on that front. So I'm already cooked. But yeah. So what was I saying? Okay. So [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=208.24s)]
*  we March and I got in an Uber, March came over to my place and we got an Uber to go to the airport [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=214.08s)]
*  yesterday. We got a, we got a plane out at nine originally at 9 50 PM. And I wanted to, as always [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=222.88000000000002s)]
*  cut it close. And March was like, dude, let's not cut it close. You always do this. And then we always [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=232.56s)]
*  get into like some issues. Let's go early. And I was like, you know what? You're right. Let's go [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=240.08s)]
*  early. You're fine. We will do that. And we left like much earlier than I normally would. We left [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=245.36s)]
*  like two hours basically before the flight even starts boarding. And for the first time ever, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=252.0s)]
*  this has never happened to me in Los Angeles and like the decade plus that I've lived there, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=260.48s)]
*  uh, at least when I'm going to LAX, like, cause obviously when you go to LAX, like there's gonna [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=265.52000000000004s)]
*  be issues, there's gonna be traffic when you go to LAX and you account for that. But there was [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=271.6s)]
*  something a little bit different than that. There was something more than just traffic. It was [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=276.64s)]
*  complete gridlock. Now, because this is like what 9 AM over there, 9 30 AM in Los Angeles right now, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=280.48s)]
*  many of you are probably not even tuning in from Los Angeles. You're probably, these are my East [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=287.28000000000003s)]
*  coast Hassan Abbey heads that are in the chat going, finally we're in the same time zone. This [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=291.6s)]
*  is fantastic. For those of you who don't know, think about it like New York pre congestion pricing. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=296.56s)]
*  Okay. LA has a lot of traffic, just like New York. I know I'm going to, I'm going to use East coast [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=301.84000000000003s)]
*  terms for you because we're, we're doing East coast and EU right now we're doing East coast and [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=307.04s)]
*  EU hours Midwest baddies rise up. Yeah. Midwesterners will not understand this. You will just not, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=312.88s)]
*  you don't, there's not enough motion in the Midwest for you to comprehend what's going on with [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=320.08s)]
*  regards to traffic, but LA has a pastime, a favored cherish pastime and that is police chases. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=324.15999999999997s)]
*  Now I've entertained this pastime because it's a, it's a formative part of the Los Angeles economy. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=331.2s)]
*  It's like we got Hollywood and we got police chases. Like it's important. It's a self-sustaining [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=337.36s)]
*  ecosystem and I contribute to it as a Los Angeles myself by watching, except those police chases are [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=342.47999999999996s)]
*  obviously very dangerous and they oftentimes can lead to unnecessary nuisances. The reason why [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=349.84s)]
*  I'm mentioning this is because it finally happened to me. I was right behind a goddamn police chase, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=356.88s)]
*  or at least the finality of a goddamn police chase. Please turn on live captions option on Twitch. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=363.67999999999995s)]
*  Yours can turn them on and off. Mods can do it too. Disabled H OH love you. We want to understand [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=369.91999999999996s)]
*  mods can do it too. I don't know how to do it, but if there's a easy optionality, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=375.28s)]
*  I will switch it on for you. But I don't even know if you can understand what I'm saying. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=380.88s)]
*  If you quite literally cannot comprehend without subtitles anyway, but here's the thing. We got [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=385.44s)]
*  stuck behind a police chase. We got stuck behind a police chase and it was one of the funniest [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=394.71999999999997s)]
*  places to get stuck into because it's right on like, this is Los Anacaprila like near LAX [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=400.88s)]
*  and there's nowhere to go virtually every virtually. This is one of those like routes [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=408.56s)]
*  where if you get stuck there, there is literally nowhere you can walk. Even with your, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=415.2s)]
*  even with your, your bags, which we entertained March called the Uber, the Uber also got stuck. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=420.4s)]
*  Right? So, you know, some funny, funny stuff to happen here. I mean, we were there for basically [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=427.6s)]
*  an hour and a half and there was just no way we were making it to the flight. We had to, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=433.52000000000004s)]
*  we had to call up Austin's and you know, my management teams like flight guy. And he was [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=438.16s)]
*  apparently at an arm and arm and Van Buren concert. And he was able to secure us a new [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=445.04s)]
*  plane tickets. I was close to not going. I was like, dude, maybe it's Kismet. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=450.56s)]
*  Maybe we don't show up to this protest and we just, you know, we scrapped the DC wing of the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=454.72s)]
*  trip and we just go directly to New York city. And March was Adam. And he was like, no, we got [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=459.84000000000003s)]
*  to do it. We got to do it. It's going to be great. And, and lo and behold, here we are. But yeah, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=465.52000000000004s)]
*  here it is. This is, this is after, you know, is you got the cops and whatnot. But yeah, I, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=469.76000000000005s)]
*  uh, we get to LAX, we get to LAX TSA, by the way, always Hassan Abihaz at the TSA line, LAX [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=479.2s)]
*  always all of, a lot of you work for TSA. It's very strange. I used to talk way more shit. I used [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=490.8s)]
*  to talk hellish shit about the TSA. I don't anymore because so many of you seemingly work for the TSA. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=497.12s)]
*  I look over at March, he's getting his gooch checked in by a dude who recognizes me and says, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=503.36s)]
*  oh, I used to work for Twitch rivals. Now I work at TSA. March is getting his shit fondled. I'm on [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=512.96s)]
*  the other line. Every single bag of mine is getting powder swabbed. Every single one. Like I, I put [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=518.88s)]
*  like four buckets, different buckets, cause I have like electronics. I have all this equipment and [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=527.52s)]
*  stuff, right? For live streaming. Every single one of them is getting powder swabbed GSR for all of [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=532.16s)]
*  it. And normally it happens like, cause, cause the TVU system, the TVU bag that I bring is like weird. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=540.0s)]
*  It's complicated. It looks odd. It looks like potentially it could be like, uh, you know, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=547.8399999999999s)]
*  like a bomb or something. I don't know, but I'm getting swabbed. I'm getting this shit swabbed [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=552.8s)]
*  up and down. And that's the photo. And it's actually ironically a house on Abbey head that's [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=557.76s)]
*  swabbing my shit. So yeah, I just had to sit there and wait for them to go through all the stuff. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=562.8s)]
*  Didn't matter. Uh, luckily I made it on the flight. I was a big mess down some Zeke will [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=568.8s)]
*  to be able to make it onto the flight or to be able to sleep on the flight. Cause it's a red eye. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=575.76s)]
*  Uh, I'm a business class, but it's not life flat, right? Cause there's no life flat, uh, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=581.28s)]
*  flights going from Los Angeles to the Dulles. So I at least have a little bit of red leg room, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=588.48s)]
*  which is fine, but I can't sleep. So I had to basically try and like, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=594.64s)]
*  prank myself to be able to go to sleep. And I don't think I got a lot of good sleep. Let's be real. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=600.16s)]
*  Uh, I should have gone through IAD. Well, there weren't a lot of options. We had to literally [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=606.88s)]
*  get a new ticket last second. Remember? But yeah. Um, luckily the pilot is DEI. I suspect is [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=611.36s)]
*  we landed, uh, and we're fine. Bro. Dulles that's crazy to fly into those. So goddamn far from the [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=619.28s)]
*  city. Yeah. Well, Dulles is also, you know what I realized? Dulles is DEI is, is, is basically DEI [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=627.2s)]
*  in and of itself. Cause it's like international Dulles international airport, D I a D E I a just, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=635.68s)]
*  it doesn't have the E, but pretty much when you go into Dulles, you're locked in, you're doing DEI. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=644.8s)]
*  You're not going to die. Okay. That's what I realized, at least in my mind, I'm doing like, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=650.3199999999999s)]
*  I'm doing this new thing where I'm basically doing numerology, but for liberalism, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=656.0799999999999s)]
*  like for woke where, you know, after the fact I'm doing post-hoc rationalizations, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=660.48s)]
*  I'm trying to figure out how gay the pilot is afterwards. You know, when we land safely. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=668.32s)]
*  So that's, that's what I'm, uh, that's what I've been up to. That's what I've been doing. Anyway, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=673.84s)]
*  I, uh, I come in. Oh, the one funny thing was when we were stuck in traffic, I'm walking to get a [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG22pbqcUn4&t=678.8000000000001s)]
