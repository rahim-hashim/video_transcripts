# Black Vampires In 1930s America | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA)
*  If you are black living in the Jim Crow South, are you better off being a vampire? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=0.0s)]
*  Which I think was also somewhat entertaining as a as an interesting hypothetical to to ask. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=7.5s)]
*  And it doesn't like it literally doesn't move you in the direction either. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=16.5s)]
*  Like it's it's very cool. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=21.0s)]
*  It's very cool because it's like it literally doesn't. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=24.2s)]
*  And let me tell you it was for a very good reason. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=30.7s)]
*  Recession indicator you say I say yes. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=36.2s)]
*  The good reason why I ended the broadcast early at the eight hours is not because I was going to watch the pit. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=39.4s)]
*  But instead I was going to go watch something else. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=46.2s)]
*  It's because my good friends over at RDC. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=48.6s)]
*  You guys might remember them supreme dreams Mark Phillips RDC. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=52.6s)]
*  The people that are putting out dream con they invited me to something they invited me to a very special screening of a very special movie. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=58.0s)]
*  That's right sinners. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=68.8s)]
*  And it worked out perfectly because I had seen Hideo Kojima post about sinners. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=71.4s)]
*  It's going to be out soon. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=78.8s)]
*  They had a special screening for sinners ahead of time. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=81.0s)]
*  But Hideo Kojima has posted about sinners and I was very excited to watch it for that reason. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=84.80000000000001s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=89.80000000000001s)]
*  It's not because like I'm a Ryan head or anything like that personally. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=91.2s)]
*  I mean I think he's great but I wasn't I'm not like I wouldn't call myself a seasoned fan of of Ryan Coogler even though he's made some great movies. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  I'm not like a Coogler right. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=109.0s)]
*  You know but I was excited. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=110.4s)]
*  I was excited because Kojima who I consider to be a profound genius and an Ameribu of sorts. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=113.6s)]
*  I saw him post about it and I saw him post about it twice as a matter of fact which is why I was excited to see it. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=122.0s)]
*  And that is what I did. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=130.79999999999998s)]
*  I went and I I watched it and let me tell you it was fantastic. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=132.29999999999998s)]
*  It was really cool and I think it's really cool because it does the thing that I've talked about quite a bit with respect to how you can just like automatically make something cool and different and unique even if the concept itself is one that has been used and abused and sinners. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=139.0s)]
*  For those of you who don't know is Ryan Coogler's latest flick with Michael B. Jordan as the star. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=157.8s)]
*  It's it's really cool. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=164.8s)]
*  It's really cool. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=166.20000000000002s)]
*  Upcoming American period supernatural horror film written produced and directed by Ryan Coogler set in the 1930s in the southern United States film stars Michael B. Jordan as twin brothers smoke and stack who returned to their hometown but are faced with a greater evil and the greater evil. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=167.39999999999998s)]
*  They face it was it was very very cool. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  I liked it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=187.5s)]
*  I think it's like vampire flicks are you know they're vampire flicks have been done. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=189.0s)]
*  They've been done to the ground vampire flicks in periods and as a period piece have even been attempted and tried and tested and also been done as well. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=196.9s)]
*  But watching a vampire like thriller supernatural horror in a historic setting where their perspective is around black people experiencing the Jim Crow South. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=210.70000000000002s)]
*  That was very cool. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=226.1s)]
*  I liked it. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=227.70000000000002s)]
*  It's not a spoiler dude. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=228.6s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=230.1s)]
*  This is literally the fucking premise. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=230.9s)]
*  What what do you mean spoiler? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=233.1s)]
*  Did you see the trailer? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=235.5s)]
*  It is set in the Mississippi Delta which is yes a very cool and interesting setting in my opinion for a vampire flick in general. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=237.1s)]
*  Yeah everything that I mentioned is literally in the trailers for the record. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=245.9s)]
*  So I thought it was cool. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=250.70000000000002s)]
*  I thought it was very cool and Michael B. Jordan is so sick and everyone else was so sick in it too. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=252.3s)]
*  It was great has been done Abe the vampire killer. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=260.1s)]
*  Yeah but that's Abraham Lincoln. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=263.3s)]
*  It's not from the perspective of like how what would happen the the the thriller basically answers the question if you've ever had such a question of like what would it look like if like what would it be like to to think about like black people's existence in the Jim Crow South in the 1930s? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=265.8s)]
*  Okay, if there was also vampires involved and I think that there one part about this that I will say is very cool is and this is not a spoiler at all. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=286.1s)]
*  But it also makes you wonder if you are black living in the Jim Crow South. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=298.3s)]
*  Are you better off being a vampire which I think was also somewhat entertaining as a as an interesting hypothetical to to ask and it doesn't like it literally doesn't move you in the direction either like it. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=306.2s)]
*  It's it's very cool. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=323.4s)]
*  It's very cool because it's like it literally doesn't tilt the scales in favor of either side of the argument either. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=326.0s)]
*  So it just kind of leaves you questioning whether or not black people are better off becoming vampires. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=333.5s)]
*  So I thought it was yeah, it was a great movie. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=339.3s)]
*  It was a great movie and you know, I will be attending dream con as well obviously. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=343.3s)]
*  So that was cool. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=350.4s)]
*  But yeah, great stuff overall. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=352.09999999999997s)]
*  You did a little bit. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=355.4s)]
*  He's got headphones on I think anyway based on Twilight lore black people can remain as vampires. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=357.8s)]
*  Wait, what I didn't know that more such example spoilers mean nothing to those of us who actually enjoy something most enjoy the difference. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=364.0s)]
*  There is no or low chance of ruining anything. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=369.2s)]
*  No, I mean there is a chance of ruining something. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=371.09999999999997s)]
*  I'm not going to give you any twist or anything like that. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=373.0s)]
*  So in fascist us is it better being MAGA? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=375.09999999999997s)]
*  I think the answer is still nobody humanizes though who sought to come to to conform for protection. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=377.5s)]
*  Ava lava. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=383.9s)]
*  Nate the Agumas what almost early. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=386.0s)]
*  I'll let you know all my music on. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=388.1s)]
*  Okay, so I don't even think that the vampires are automatically MAGA by the way. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=389.4s)]
*  That's the other thing but it's a cool thought experiment. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=393.0s)]
*  So that's what I watched last night. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=396.2s)]
*  And then this morning I woke up early. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=398.9s)]
*  I woke up early as heck. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=400.7s)]
*  And the reason why I woke up early as heck is because the twist is Bruce Willis is dead the whole time. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=403.0s)]
*  Are you making a studio joke because I thought it was really good. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=410.2s)]
*  You spoiled the trailer. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=414.0s)]
*  I haven't watched it yet. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=414.90000000000003s)]
*  The twist is Bruce Willis is dead the whole time. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=416.6s)]
*  That's a relief. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=418.6s)]
*  That was that is a that's a meme from the studio, which is really good. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=419.7s)]
*  By the way, I recommend watching Apple TV has some straightforward bangers. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=425.7s)]
*  I've been watching the studio with what's his face Seth Rogan and it's meta commentary on why Apple TV is trying to become [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=431.79999999999995s)]
*  premium television in the age of HBO turning into HBO Max basically and in the age of streamers Apple TV stands alone [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=439.5s)]
*  and wants to become a studio in the real world and the studio the show that they made is meta commentary on that pretty much [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=448.09999999999997s)]
*  like on the industry and where it's turned into. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=456.79999999999995s)]
*  I know it's a six cents meme dude. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=459.9s)]
*  I know they also make that joke Ron Howard makes that joke in one of the episodes of the studio. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=461.59999999999997s)]
*  That's why I thought it was funny that he brought it up because I'd seen it recently. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=466.5s)]
*  That's why it's in my mind. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=469.09999999999997s)]
*  Anyway, yeah, I've been I've been dude. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=471.5s)]
*  I'm on a media tear right now. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=474.09999999999997s)]
*  I'm freaking consuming content. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=475.7s)]
*  I'm appearing in content speaking of media that I'm appearing in. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=477.59999999999997s)]
*  The Daily Show was at my house earlier today. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=481.9s)]
*  So it's been a really interesting journey watching The Daily Show in Turkey growing up and having John Stewart play a [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=485.0s)]
*  formative role in my commentary and what I wanted to do with my life to having to hosting The Daily Show in my home [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=492.4s)]
*  for a piece that they're doing with Jordan Klepper. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=500.09999999999997s)]
*  It was very cool. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=505.59999999999997s)]
*  We had a lot of fun and that'll be coming out in the middle of next month. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=506.4s)]
*  So that's that's cool. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=510.59999999999997s)]
*  I got interviewed by The Daily Show. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=511.79999999999995s)]
*  So I was doing that this morning, which is the reason why I couldn't take kind of the dog part, which is the reason why [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=513.5s)]
*  I couldn't work out myself. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=518.8s)]
*  And for that reason, I'm a little bit. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=520.0s)]
*  You write the scripts next month. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=524.0s)]
*  Apparently a lot of the writers were stoked when they heard that I was going to get interviewed. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=525.4s)]
*  So I don't know if they were lying to me and they just kind of say that to everybody or if I am right and some of you [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=530.9s)]
*  are in here stop and watch this after two IT days. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=537.1s)]
*  I'll cry. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=539.8s)]
*  Yeah, in any case, let's blast off. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=540.5s)]
*  Also die work where we have finally we've finally found ourselves in the crosshairs with die work where by the way, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=543.1s)]
*  I just saw this your biases upholding Xi Jinping thought are you suggesting Taiwan is not a part of Taiwan is not part of China? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=551.9s)]
*  I'm not a sin. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=559.3s)]
*  If I think there are plenty of talented Asians like the ones from Japan Taiwan Taiwan Japan Taiwan Taiwan Japan Italy Japan. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=559.7s)]
*  Oh never mind. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=566.0s)]
*  I'm [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tlk-5pEdA&t=567.2s)]
