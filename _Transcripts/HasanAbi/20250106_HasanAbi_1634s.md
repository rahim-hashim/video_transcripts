# This Is Plunging America Into Chaos | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY)
*  guys that engage in actions. Okay, if they if those actions [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=0.0s)]
*  are declared disruptive to the regular order of business, they [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  will be considered by the state. Luigi Mangione comes to mind. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=10.44s)]
*  Let's get back to the Cybertruck investigation. One that also is [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=21.44s)]
*  confusing. We turn now to the investigation into the New Year's [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=27.48s)]
*  Day Cybertruck blast outside the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas. This morning, we're [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=30.8s)]
*  hearing from the ex girlfriend of the Green Beret identified as the driver. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=35.52s)]
*  Mola Langi joins us with that story. Good morning, Mola. Well, good morning, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=39.72s)]
*  Rebecca. Yes, and authorities investigate that cyber truck explosion [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=42.96s)]
*  in Las Vegas this morning. We're hearing from someone who was in contact with [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=46.32s)]
*  Matthew Livells burger through his final days. I failed him. We all failed [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=49.84s)]
*  the ex girlfriend of Matthew Livells burger, the man who carried out the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=54.48s)]
*  Las Vegas blast in front of the Trump Hotel opening up about their final [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=57.92s)]
*  messages. Alicia Erich hadn't heard from her ex boyfriend, Livells burger, a [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=62.48s)]
*  decorated U. S. Army Special Forces soldier in over two years when she says [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  he started texting her on December 27th out of the blue, asking how she was. He [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=71.44s)]
*  was just checking up on me. What began as casual messages quickly became the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=76.75999999999999s)]
*  last words she would ever exchange with him. The master sergeant served in the U. S. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=81.88000000000001s)]
*  Army for almost 20 years. He was even featured on the history channel series, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=86.60000000000001s)]
*  ultimate soldier challenge in 2013. We're going to go full out just like we've [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=90.84s)]
*  done the entire challenge in 2018 when Eric and Livells burger were dating. In [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=95.4s)]
*  the interest of fairness, I will say that that history channel episode that we [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=99.80000000000001s)]
*  watched here and investigated thoroughly on the Hanson Abbey broadcast was [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=103.72s)]
*  absolutely cooked. They cook the books on that one. They really put, they [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=107.08000000000001s)]
*  really firmly place their thumb on that scale. Okay. I just want everybody to [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=111.4s)]
*  understand that that history channel episode is ridiculous, ridiculous. It was [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=116.88s)]
*  rigged. He started to open up about the struggles he was facing at one point, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=124.0s)]
*  texting. I have been spiraling down the last week or so. Sometimes I get so [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=128.4s)]
*  hopeless and depressed by far the worst of my life. He, he was really open about [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=133.28s)]
*  um, the trauma he faced and the, the teammates he lost on December 29th. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=141.68s)]
*  Livells burger sent pictures of the cyber truck he rented. He sent some [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=149.0s)]
*  front views and he shared, he felt like he was Batman or halo. It wasn't until [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=153.24s)]
*  two days later when the FBI contacted Eric that she found out what happened in [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=159.78000000000003s)]
*  Las Vegas. They started to show me a video of him in the cyber truck. My [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=164.24s)]
*  whole heart broke for him that he, that he was so broken that he got to that [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=169.88s)]
*  place. Eric is still struggling with why Livells burger would take his own life. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=174.79999999999998s)]
*  He didn't say anything explicit that would have triggered it. I guess one is [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=180.28s)]
*  nearly 20 years of military service. Livells burger saw multiple combat [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=185.88s)]
*  deployments. The FBI describing the incident in Las Vegas as a media so [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=189.96s)]
*  crazy. They're like, yo, this, this guy's so sick. It's not every day. Do you [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=194.0s)]
*  have an instance where you have like two military veterans, both Tory, both [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=198.68s)]
*  the toward Afghanistan do two separate like incidents. Okay. And on the one hand, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=203.28s)]
*  the, the Brown guy who converted to Islam is, you know, explained it a very [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=210.68s)]
*  different way. Obviously the circumstances are different because like, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=216.08s)]
*  um, Jabbar successfully carried out a killing 14 innocent civilians. Whereas, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=220.68s)]
*  whereas Matthew Lilzberger, holy shit, it was intense special forces group with [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=227.72s)]
*  this guy, Osprey and pray. I can't tell if this person is like, w w this is too [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=231.51999999999998s)]
*  much. Like after I interviewed, I already interviewed, I already interviewed one [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=236.32s)]
*  person that was directly, that directly knew one of the, one of the people. Is [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=242.32s)]
*  this for real? Are we got another one to know your point? Her is valid. The [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=247.56s)]
*  cousin said you, she has to worry about Islamophobia. I don't think this woman [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=251.92s)]
*  has the same concern. If you want to come on and talk about Matthew, life is [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=256.12s)]
*  burger. If you want to come on and talk about Matthew life is burger, please [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=260.12s)]
*  send the mods a proof that you serve with this guy and we'll have you on. Or [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=263.02s)]
*  if you want to talk about it, why not? Are you telling me we have door kickers [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=267.62s)]
*  in the audience? Yes. I think people always people routinely forget how many [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=271.22s)]
*  veterans and how many active duty service members are in this community. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=275.92s)]
*  Dude, I, I serve predominantly an American audience. Okay. Like it's not [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=280.82s)]
*  shocking at all. The American military, the defense department is the second [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=287.62s)]
*  largest hiring body in the country. I explained this with regular frequency to [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=292.02s)]
*  people who are still shocked by this. It's no different than having someone be [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=298.92s)]
*  having someone in the job. You're like, yeah, I work for Walmart. Okay. Or I [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=303.71999999999997s)]
*  work for Amazon. Walmart is the largest hiring body in the country. The second [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=308.42s)]
*  largest is the defense department. It's the Pentagon. Also, I would go so far as [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=315.02000000000004s)]
*  to say that like, given the experiences that people go through, if you have [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=320.42s)]
*  toured, you have an even higher likelihood of becoming as against [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=326.12s)]
*  American capitalism and American American Wars in general. So tragic case [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=332.42s)]
*  of suicide by a highly decorated service member struggling with PTSD and other [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=340.42s)]
*  issues guys. Sad beyond words, Mola. Thank you. We're seeing Canadian prime [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=345.92s)]
*  minister Justin. All right. We're not going to get to the Canada stuff yet. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=350.02s)]
*  Hold on. There was more I wanted to talk about a couple of reasons as to why the [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=353.71999999999997s)]
*  media coverage is very different with Libous burger is that obviously first [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=357.42s)]
*  and foremost, he's white. Okay, that's important. He's also a door kicker more [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=360.92s)]
*  decorated than chum chum. So Dean Jabbar didn't do it for us and also killed, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=367.42s)]
*  you know, zero people except for himself. Those are the, those are the major [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=376.42s)]
*  reasons as to why the media coverage is a little different. Oh, also he's a [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=380.32s)]
*  Trump supporter. More importantly than the fact that he's white. He is also a [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=384.22s)]
*  Trump supporter. So there's that. But once again, even white guys that engage [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=388.42s)]
*  in actions, okay, if they, if those actions are declared disruptive to the [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=395.62s)]
*  regular order of business, they will be considered by the state. Luigi Mangione [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=403.02s)]
*  comes to mind. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=409.82s)]
*  Anyway, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=419.32s)]
*  Oh, this I saw this as well from 1990 to 2010 about seven persons per year [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=427.52s)]
*  with US military backgrounds committed crimes since 2011. That number is [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=433.92s)]
*  almost jumped to 45 per year. Now, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=438.52s)]
*  One might say this number has increased because MKUltra. I don't think it's [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=443.02s)]
*  that. I don't think that that is the case. I think that, you know, I don't [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=449.12s)]
*  think is MKUltra or anything like that. I think it's more so that there are [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=454.21999999999997s)]
*  more people touring. There are more people that are directly in combat since [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=458.02s)]
*  America's war on terror. Since in this timeframe, the thing that changed from [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=462.02s)]
*  1990 to 2010, what, what changed significantly from 2010 onwards is the [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=468.82s)]
*  reality that there are far more individuals that went overseas to actually [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=476.21999999999997s)]
*  go and engage in direct combat. So I think it's more so a chickens coming [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=481.71999999999997s)]
*  home the roost type situation rather than, you know, rather than a direct [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=486.21999999999997s)]
*  CIA sleeper cell initiative or something. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=495.12s)]
*  We forget that Timothy McVeigh was a vet and washed out a Ranger school [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=497.82000000000005s)]
*  before being radicalized by Ruby Ridge and Waco. Yep. During interview saying [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=501.12s)]
*  your ex-infantry is an immediate no-go because they're afraid you're going to [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=504.82000000000005s)]
*  kill your co-workers. Also, a lot of people join at the lowest point of their [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=507.32000000000005s)]
*  lives. There are a surprising amount of people who treat military as their [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=510.72s)]
*  last resort. Yeah. How do we know he was a Trump supporter? Even in the end, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=513.72s)]
*  it feels weird that he did this at the Trump's hotel and still claims to [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=517.62s)]
*  support him. I know something, something about that also doesn't really fully [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=520.9200000000001s)]
*  add up either. Yeah. New York Times is also hitting the I-**** note pretty hard [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=525.22s)]
*  with Shamsuddin Jabbar. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=530.12s)]
*  A****** and resurgence. We explore the main reasons for I-****** resurgence. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=531.52s)]
*  Fourth, Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel and the ensuing war seem to have [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=535.62s)]
*  encouraged more attacks. Hamas fighters streamed some of their killings that [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=538.92s)]
*  day partly to inspire copycat I-*******. We've seen the threat from foreign [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=542.22s)]
*  I-****** rise to a whole nother level after the October 7th. Christopher Ray, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=545.62s)]
*  the FBI director told Congress last spring. Hamas and I-******, they're the [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=548.82s)]
*  same, is a ridiculous thing to claim because Hamas does not bear similarities [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=553.42s)]
*  to I-******, especially when Israel is a much, is a much similar point right [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=560.42s)]
*  there. I mean, even very old mass shootings were done by vets. Texan and [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=568.3199999999999s)]
*  massacre was done by Marine Lee, Lee Harvey Oswald was also a Marine. It's [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=571.92s)]
*  wild. It's wild that they're looking at the situation and going, it's wild at [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=577.62s)]
*  the situation. I mean, this is this right here. This right here is so [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=582.02s)]
*  insane that it is no different than tying Iran to the war on terror. A [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=588.42s)]
*  ridiculous lie that the American government presented at the time. The [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=597.42s)]

*  Interviewing one of the main prosecutors on the case. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1232.82s)]
*  The biggest difficulty is evidentiary explains gas using evidence to link to a specific [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1236.4199999999998s)]

*  of suspects were caught on thousand offensive was committed is almost impossible. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1243.82s)]
*  The usual laws of evidence are not suitable for this event. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1246.62s)]
*  There are no organized chains of evidence. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1249.02s)]
*  There's no one who filmed the videos you want to present in court. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1251.12s)]
*  Legislation needs to be amended. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1253.62s)]
*  Otherwise, it is impossible to deal with these cases, but even amending legislation [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1255.32s)]
*  can't be applied retroactively. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1258.7199999999998s)]
*  So it won't exactly work here. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1260.12s)]
*  There really needs to be reform of the legislation in terms of evidence. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1261.72s)]
*  So you can file an indictment. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1264.6200000000001s)]
*  I hope they're doing it, but everything is going too slowly. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1266.32s)]
*  In the end, you need a confession in a case like this. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1268.82s)]
*  You need everyone to tell what their part was in order to build a story of a place. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1271.72s)]
*  How many terrorists were in that place? [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1276.1200000000001s)]
*  What they did? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1277.82s)]
*  What the advanced planning was? [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1278.52s)]
*  How far in advance they knew all of this is important from an evidentiary point of view. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1279.92s)]
*  But surprisingly in the interrogations of these terrorists, they try to minimize the [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1283.22s)]
*  nationalistic aspect from my experience in security cases. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1287.92s)]
*  Most terrorists are very proud of what they did and do not hide it. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1290.62s)]
*  They also tell the interrogator that they are very proud. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1293.52s)]
*  Even on October 7, you could learn how they behave from the GoPro camera recordings, how [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1296.2199999999998s)]
*  motivated and ideologically imbued they were. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1299.62s)]
*  But the bottom line is that most of the black Sabbath terrorists turned out to be cowards. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1301.62s)]
*  In interrogations, no one admits the shooting. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1305.52s)]
*  I shot and didn't hit. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1307.62s)]
*  I was injured immediately when I entered the outpost. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1308.7199999999998s)]
*  I had restraint. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1310.82s)]
*  That's not how I'm used to seeing terror. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1311.7199999999998s)]
*  One reason for the delay in the prosecution is an attempt not to sabotage the chances [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1314.2199999999998s)]
*  of the abductees return. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1317.7199999999998s)]
*  Another reason is the fear that Palestinians and human rights organizations in Europe will [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1319.02s)]
*  increase initiatives for illegal counter-attack against Israel. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1322.72s)]
*  In the meantime, alternatives have been considered such as establishing a special court for the [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1325.42s)]
*  massacre of terrorists or imposing jurisdiction in this matter in the military court in Lod, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1329.6200000000001s)]
*  which was closed in 2000 and until then dealt with those accused activities against state [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1333.22s)]
*  security. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1339.02s)]
*  The issue here is that the Israeli government flubbed and the Israeli the the initial [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1339.6200000000001s)]
*  organizations were there were on the ground destroyed all evidence not not deliberately. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1349.72s)]
*  I'm not saying that at all. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1355.6200000000001s)]
*  So why you say this without proof? [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1357.02s)]
*  What are you talking to the person who wrote this article? [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1359.22s)]

*  Fakassan death to Turkey call us peasants. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1372.92s)]
*  Where is this peasant thing coming from? [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1376.3200000000002s)]
*  Is this like the new meta? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1378.12s)]
*  Did something pop off on Twitter or someone clipped me making fun of peasant mentality? [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1379.42s)]
*  You said it bozo or is that the same chatter? [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1384.52s)]
*  Yes, dude. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1387.42s)]
*  If you defend your Lord King and your God, then you have peasant mentality is true. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1388.02s)]
*  Sad to say you and report from like six months ago stated that there were 5000 photographs [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1394.42s)]
*  and 50 hours of footage total of cell phone surveillance body cams and dash cams in the [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1399.42s)]
*  human reports. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1402.72s)]
*  There was zero digital evidence found not to mean no sexual violence happened. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1403.22s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1407.22s)]
*  So basically, basically they just don't have any evidence part of that is because they [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1407.72s)]
*  ruined forensic evidence in the immediate aftermath of October 7. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1416.22s)]
*  And the other reason for it is because there wasn't any evidence with the exception of [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1420.92s)]
*  one according to the UN reports that happened. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1426.72s)]
*  They also did not allow a international. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1430.1200000000001s)]
*  They did not allow for outside investigators to go in and apply. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1435.12s)]
*  I don't know some rigorous standard of forensics. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1439.9199999999998s)]
*  So ultimately, I think running with the New York Times narrative on this is so crazy like [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1442.82s)]
*  that there was directed mass rape that took place. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1450.22s)]

*  The fact that Israel internally publishes a guide to escape war crimes prosecution is [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1464.32s)]
*  amusing enough. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8e35JR1xDY&t=1468.02s)]
