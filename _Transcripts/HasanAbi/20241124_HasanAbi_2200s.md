# Ironmouse Situation Is INSANE | Hasanabi Reacts to ConnorDawg
**HasanAbi:** [November 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc)
*  I'm a 33 year old man. I like anime. I don't fully understand the Vtuber phenomena [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=0.0s)]
*  I would never disparage it unless they were like doing you know, and I don't spend a great deal of time [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=5.72s)]
*  on Vtubers [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=11.72s)]
*  Because I'm a normal person. I just don't understand it. Like I don't I don't get it [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=13.84s)]
*  I don't get why people pay so much time [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=18.46s)]
*  Pay so much attention and and get so angry. They like prime themselves up [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=21.68s)]
*  a [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=30.2s)]
*  Long-winded rant and if you like that welcome come join the angry British man [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=31.68s)]
*  And if not, don't worry my normal videos will resume after this one. I just had to talk about this. I dude [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=35.68s)]
*  I'm not gonna lie. I'm actually kind of annoyed [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=40.92s)]
*  With every single person in the chat just chirping about whatever videos I choose to watch [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=43.88s)]
*  Just don't watch I guess, you know, no one is forcing you at gunpoint like you're being lame as dude. Shut up [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=50.0s)]
*  I think one of the I think one of the most annoying parts about me saying like oh [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=55.92s)]
*  We're gonna do Sunday fun day. Is that hella people mean? Oh that means like he's gonna watch my personal favorite video [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=59.68s)]
*  No, that doesn't mean that at all. It means I'm gonna not do [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=67.76s)]
*  Immediate and direct news commentary. Okay, that's all that means [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=72.12s)]
*  So I don't know why every single person comes in here to go. He said Sunday fun day [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=77.6s)]
*  it's like just buckle in I feel like online lately it has been a [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=83.5s)]
*  miserable experience for any of us to be online and I actively feel that my mental health gets drained slowly [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=89.68s)]
*  Like here one last point I'm gonna make on this before we get into this the the iron mouth situation is dire [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=96.12s)]
*  Okay, but also [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=101.84s)]
*  One last point I'll make on this is is we literally sat through and watched like three hours of [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=104.68s)]
*  Korean gender wars, okay three and hours of gender wars in Korea and it was amazing [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=111.4s)]
*  It was educational it was fantastic. We found a new [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=117.6s)]
*  We found a a new content creator. Well, it was great [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=122.36s)]
*  Using any online platform, especially my personal case Twitter [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=127.4s)]
*  I think Twitter allowing people to make money from ads is pretty one of the worst changes to any platform in history [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=131.84s)]
*  Sure, I get $20 here and there for tweeting a funny picture of my giant monkey behind me [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=137.8s)]
*  But there are those who use it to spread misinformation lies just make stuff up spew absolute vile hatred stuff [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=142.38s)]
*  It's pretty horrible experience to use it now as Twitter seems to feel like it only wants [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  Outragement bait or tweets that'll make people angry and if you're not seeing that you're seeing somebody get killed [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  So it's really just a miserable experience overall and don't get me started on tik-tok and Instagram [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=160.28s)]
*  Which are famous for their brutal comments and I wouldn't really even use the word brutal [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=165.26s)]
*  I think brutal can sometimes mean there's a bit of honesty and fun there [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=169.86s)]
*  But I would say just like just being online right now is cool [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=172.58s)]
*  I feels like nobody has any respect for each other [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  But I don't think I've quite lost as much faith in the internet as I have until now [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=179.72000000000003s)]
*  Look, I'll be honest. This video is about one thing. It's about the weird blanket hatred towards vtubers [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=184.34s)]
*  I've seen a massive massive hate train against iron mouse [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=190.56s)]
*  Which I don't understand and I know that you guys aren't the ones doing this [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=194.3s)]
*  You guys watching this video are very normal and well-adjusted people and I appreciate that but there are a lot of people online [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=197.85999999999999s)]
*  That seem to just have fun ruining other people's lives [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=203.06s)]
*  I'm a 33 year old man. I like anime. I don't fully understand the vtuber phenomena [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=207.73999999999998s)]
*  I would never disparage it unless they were like doing, you know, weird lolly shit [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=213.42s)]
*  Okay, and I don't spend a great deal of time shitting on vtubers [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=218.7s)]
*  Because I'm a normal person I just don't understand it like I don't I don't get it [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=223.85999999999999s)]
*  I don't get why people pay so much time pay so much attention and and get so angry [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=228.46s)]
*  They like prime themselves up to being like and hate our mouse like she's amazing. She's an amazing person and her story is amazing [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=234.66s)]
*  She's resilient. She's strong [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=243.7s)]
*  she's awesome making the most out of [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=245.78s)]
*  There I say dire circumstances that she was dealt and it blows my mind people just like direct their their endless [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=249.14s)]
*  Towards her it really pisses me off our mouse has autoimmune disease [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=256.62s)]
*  Okay, we we fundraise this community's fundraise for her and Connor does all these charities as well for no [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=260.78s)]
*  She doesn't see vid, isn't it? He'll explain it. Just let's watch. Okay, just what just watch I don't understand autoimmune is different [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=267.56s)]
*  Sorry, it's an immunodeficiency [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=274.1s)]
*  It isn't autoimmune is primary immune. God damn the so much so many so many conversations I've sat through and I didn't even fully get it [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=276.1s)]
*  Right. I'm so sorry [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=283.98s)]
*  Stand it now. You're probably wondering why am I bringing all of this up? Well, don't worry [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=285.86s)]
*  It'll all make sense [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=289.98s)]
*  Just just get along for the ride and listen to the weird British man rant at you [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=290.78s)]
*  You see in 2024 iron mouse broke the all-time sub record on twitch. It was a massive achievement [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=293.82s)]
*  It was I'm sure an amazing and an inspiring moment for all of us as well as mouse [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=300.3s)]
*  Unfortunately, probably what you didn't see was the deluge of vile comments disturbing threats and just overall hatred towards mouse [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=305.7s)]
*  And I'd love to tell you that this all started here and it's pretty much gone with now [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=313.14s)]
*  But sadly this is a thing that has been going on for a very very long time [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=316.21999999999997s)]
*  And this is not just for mouse VTubers in general have had to deal with a lot of shit [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=319.9s)]
*  Just for being an anime girl or boy on the internet [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=324.5s)]
*  So let's go back in time a little bit so that we can better understand the full scope of this mess [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=327.3s)]
*  Yes, you got me. This is a video about me defending my friend 100% [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=331.78000000000003s)]
*  I'm not even trying to hide that but I also just want to bring a tiny bit of attention to the level of [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=335.7s)]
*  normalized hate that is just for some reason acceptable and hopefully that you know [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=340.90000000000003s)]
*  Maybe this we were gonna make a tiny bit of a change because what some of these creators have to endure is on a level [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=344.7s)]
*  That I've never seen before on the internet and I've been here for a very long time four years ago [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=348.90000000000003s)]
*  VTubers had a massive explosion in popularity here in the West now [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=353.58s)]
*  Obviously they've been around in Japan for a while because this is very Japanese coated [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=357.34s)]
*  But you know four years ago they blew up and people started getting into them [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=361.62s)]
*  However, there was a lot of pushback from people like me included who were kind of like what is this? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=365.02s)]
*  I don't know what this is, but I like it bad or not. I don't know [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=369.06s)]
*  Yeah [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=372.3s)]
*  I don't know [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=372.48s)]
*  Just see and I'm sure any VTuber who was around in this era could tell you the amount of hatred that was given out towards [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=372.82s)]
*  VTubers like why are you using a voice changer? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=378.58s)]
*  Are you a man? Are you an AI? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=381.38s)]
*  You know pretty uninspired and in comments and during this boom is when a lot of people found Iron Mouse as well now [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=384.65999999999997s)]
*  I must have actually been streaming a long time before this as well [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=390.5s)]
*  But it wasn't until this moment where a lot of VTubers were on Twitch and kind of getting great viewership now [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=393.5s)]
*  Obviously VTubers choose to be represented by an avatar for a multitude of reasons [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=397.56s)]
*  But for mouse it was for anonymity, which is why most VTubers do it [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=401.38s)]
*  And now look I cannot talk for mouse that you know mouse is mouse is our own person [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=404.64s)]
*  But you know mouse has been sick for a very very long time with a multitude of illnesses [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=408.16s)]
*  But the main one being primary immune deficiency primary immune deficiency is slightly different to autoimmune diseases that you might have heard about [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=412.38s)]
*  Autoimmune diseases are where your fuck I should just let the video wrong it dude [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=418.04s)]
*  Immune system kind of attacks itself whereas primary immune deficiency means that your immune system just doesn't work or doesn't work very well [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=424.32s)]
*  And I'm sure a lot of my viewers are familiar with this because I'm always raising money for charities that want to find [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=431.12s)]
*  Cures and support people with primary me. I never get it right primary immune deficiencies [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=435.64s)]
*  I [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=440.47999999999996s)]
*  Mess it up all the time when you have a really bad case of primary immune deficiency [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=441.4s)]
*  It means that stuff like vaccines don't work on you. It means that you're worried about getting sick [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=444.88s)]
*  Constantly from everything whereas maybe you and I could eat a bunch of dirt [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=450.4s)]
*  Maybe going even near dirt or someone who's slightly ill 20 feet away [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=454.12s)]
*  Could easily get you sick or give you a bad case of pneumonia this disease means that mouse pretty much can't interact with anyone and can't [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=457.96s)]
*  Leave her room and even if she wanted to mouse was disabled for a very long time and it slowly started to regain the ability to [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=464.34s)]
*  Walk thanks to being able to finally support [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=470.11999999999995s)]
*  Premium healthcare yay love America [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=472.26s)]
*  so this meant the only human content the mouse got was pretty much talking to her parents or very close family who she was kind of [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=474.82s)]
*  Already adjusted to and family who understood about the disease and took precautions and look [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=480.09999999999997s)]
*  I know this is a lot of information [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=484.46s)]
*  What I'm trying to get at is that you can only imagine how crushingly lonely this must be [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=485.7s)]
*  Imagine not being able to leave your room [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=490.46000000000004s)]
*  Yes [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=492.46000000000004s)]
*  We were all there during kovat [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=492.86s)]
*  But we at least knew that it was probably gonna end at some point and I'm sure many of you knew me included [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=494.14000000000004s)]
*  But this was awful for our mental health not being able to see the people that you care about or interact with friends [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=498.86s)]
*  Which to have a casual interaction with a cashier person is interactions that I'm sure all of us missed and it was thanks to VTuber [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=503.84000000000003s)]
*  Technology getting so much better and more accessible that mouse was able to stream like me or like you or like any other big streamer [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=510.70000000000005s)]
*  It was it was it was a level playing field and on top of that if you are a more artistically inclined person you could show [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=517.38s)]
*  Off your artistic skills by you know, I don't know costume design or singing or lore or voice acting [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=523.8199999999999s)]
*  There's so many more facets to it than me raging a jump king. It's talent [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=529.46s)]
*  Okay [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=533.2s)]
*  I'm one of the best clips of mouses early career is that when she's trying to raise money to get a new medical bed [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=533.5s)]
*  Basically normal beds not good. They don't offer you support. They don't like like, you know go [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=539.34s)]
*  Like lie up right basically a lot more support she asked her viewers if they'd be willing to donate towards that and within minutes [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=543.64s)]
*  Minutes they'd smash that goal. I don't like to call my bed my works my bed my bed [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=551.04s)]
*  I don't like calling you my bed. It makes me feel very embarrassed [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=556.48s)]
*  Makes me feel not so good. So I like to call [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=560.4s)]
*  My bed my workspace because that's where I am all the time [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=564.52s)]
*  I [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=574.08s)]
*  Think a lot of people forget that mouse didn't used to stream long mouse used to only stream for like an hour or two at [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=577.2s)]
*  A time and then would go offline to take medication [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=581.52s)]
*  but now feels comfortable enough to take the medication and still keep streaming which I think is an amazing thing and something that [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=583.88s)]
*  The outpouring support has allowed us to do and obviously VTubers do more than just talk and play crappy games like me [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=589.24s)]
*  Some of them have god-tier singing skills. We all know that mouse was trained to be an opera singer and sounds incredible [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=594.6800000000001s)]
*  Incredible [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=600.12s)]
*  Combine that with aesthetically pleasing designs that are constantly changing and it's no wonder that VTubers eventually had their boom now [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=603.04s)]
*  Obviously twitch and YouTube have always been very gamer centric and gamer focused and gamers aren't exactly known for being the most chill and [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=608.8s)]
*  Reasonable people look I was a call of duty kid if I said the things that I said in those lobbies and they were recorded [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=615.08s)]
*  I would not be here today. I would not have a career or any any career. I was toxic [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=621.2s)]
*  Okay, now look I've been a content creator for 10 plus years online [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=625.76s)]
*  It's been my entire adult life [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=629.28s)]
*  I've been doing this for so long that I'm a fossil in internet years and even before that [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=631.44s)]
*  I would pretty much only spend my time on the internet and and it was normal that as a creator that you would get [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=635.8s)]
*  Some kind of hatred towards you or some people who would just [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=640.6800000000001s)]
*  Blindly write mean comments. It was part of the job doesn't mean it's a good part or that we should accept it [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=643.8s)]
*  But it's just kind of how it was and because every creator would get a bunch of hate comments here and there [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=648.72s)]
*  There was a kind of a mutual respect amongst creators that you wouldn't just blindly insult each other for no reason [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=652.72s)]
*  You wouldn't insult someone you didn't know what he didn't Oh, dude [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=657.76s)]
*  Dude, that's gone [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=661.48s)]
*  Everything is everything is devolved at that point. I feel like people used to like duke it out with one another [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=663.96s)]
*  But that's been gone, especially in my part of the content creation space. But also what is this ethnicity? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=670.4s)]
*  Mom has the exclamation mark ethnicity. Like there's a fuck. Is there is that like actually a bot in the chat? No [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=676.72s)]
*  No, I'm not saying you're a bot I'm saying like would there be a is there a command in the chat that responds to ethnicity [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=684.2399999999999s)]
*  I don't think so my suitcase. I don't know why someone says I'm in the trap. I want my suitcase [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=690.3199999999999s)]
*  Anyway, I think part of it is I think some people [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=698.3599999999999s)]
*  No matter what like when they hear the voice, they're like, I don't get this. Okay, that's it. That's what it is [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=702.6999999999999s)]
*  so if you're wondering like where it comes from like where some people's like [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=708.56s)]
*  lack of understanding comes from I [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=712.64s)]
*  Think that's where it is and have beef with it was a thing that you could expect because that's how normal people behave [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=716.16s)]
*  However nowadays it kind of feels like that's not the case anymore [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=722.52s)]
*  It feels like it's kind of encouraged or okay to punch down and make fun of other creators that you don't like [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=725.64s)]
*  Well, you think that something's weird about them and this has happened a lot with VTubers [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=730.2s)]
*  For example in 2022 a massive tick-tock creator Noah Glenn Carter made a video mocking the fact that people wanted to meet Mouse [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=734.84s)]
*  Virtually. Yeah, this might be the Saturn at so I want you to take a look at all these people [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=741.74s)]
*  They were all trying to get the attention of a monitor [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=746.3s)]
*  basically [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=749.1s)]
*  that's a popular VTuber on the monitor that was virtually attending an anime convention and [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=749.5799999999999s)]
*  This whole crowd of people were following the monitor in hopes that they could get a picture with it [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=754.54s)]
*  Now obviously you and I know that mouse can't leave her room and this is the only way that mouse can walk around a convention [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=759.18s)]
*  Or see any of her viewers or any of those viewers can talk to mouse [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=764.62s)]
*  It's a rare experience for everyone involved and an amazing feat of technology that we can even do anything like this and to his credit [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=768.42s)]
*  He did apologize [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=774.4399999999999s)]
*  This is an apology to a creator called iron mouse because of this video now in my video on this I called the video one [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=775.2199999999999s)]
*  Of the saddest videos on the internet [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=781.02s)]
*  Which is completely unnecessary on my part and iron mouse actually responded clarifying that the people weren't even crowding her [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=782.6999999999999s)]
*  But instead they were crowding somebody named Connor that was there. I'm really sorry to you iron mouse if you're watching my video was completely unnecessary [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=789.26s)]
*  I really hope that my video didn't cause you any kind of negativity or anything and again, I am so sorry if it did [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=796.0200000000001s)]
*  No, they definitely were there to see iron mouse [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=802.0600000000001s)]
*  No disrespect to Connor, but they definitely were there to also see iron mouse having said that however, it's understandable why [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=804.82s)]
*  Someone from the outside has no fucking clue what's going on. I'm I mean that's chill man [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=813.4200000000001s)]
*  They tick tock is so much better as a platform. That's crazy [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=818.1600000000001s)]
*  This guy literally instead of doubling down and like immediately calling people pedophiles or whatever [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=820.9000000000001s)]
*  He just apologized which is very cool. Like I said my side of the internet people when they get called out for some shit they [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=826.5400000000001s)]
*  Literally just turn around and be like no dude [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=834.5s)]
*  You're actually a vicious rabbit terrorism loving anti-semite and you should kill yourself [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=836.38s)]
*  That's my commentary my political commentary the respect respect to this guy for [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=841.98s)]
*  Apologizing honestly was both don't forget Connors the you of anime YouTube. Okay, I know I'm fucking around [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=847.6999999999999s)]
*  I will be deleting that video as soon as I post this one. First of all [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=853.14s)]
*  Second of all, you didn't think there was gonna be any negativity [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=857.86s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=861.18s)]
*  And now look to know his credit he did apologize and take down the video and I you know [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=862.42s)]
*  I think that that needs to be commended as a lot of people don't have the common decency to do that anymore [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=865.8199999999999s)]
*  but but would you would you not have taken it down if you if nobody complained if everyone joined in haha [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=869.8199999999999s)]
*  Let's make fun of it. Would you would you not have taken it down? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=876.76s)]
*  Would you take it down just because people am I crazy? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=878.96s)]
*  I feel like I'm so like my my level of stop saying yes [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=881.48s)]
*  My level of like vitriol online and what I think is like goes beyond the boundaries of permissibility [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=886.5600000000001s)]
*  Is so different than what Connor is representing here [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=892.8000000000001s)]
*  Like that is incredible. That's the method like this guy didn't understand what the fuck was going on thought it was weird [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=895.8000000000001s)]
*  Okay, and then when he was corrected he immediately [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=902.6s)]
*  Apologized for it. Like I wish I wish people would do that. I wish more people did that [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=906.68s)]
*  I'm kind of shocked that he even did that. So if you apologize, it doesn't matter. Am I gonna make it negative anyways? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=910.7199999999999s)]
*  No, I'm glad that that guy apologized. Um [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=915.52s)]
*  Overall though. I don't know. I mean, I I understand like that person didn't get it, right? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=918.1999999999999s)]
*  Oh, this tick talker is known for doing this so it kills that shared ability for me. Okay, like hey, man [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=922.04s)]
*  You're kind of a dick. The reason why I show you this is not because I want to send a hatred [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=926.8399999999999s)]
*  This is two years ago. It doesn't matter. It's over. Do not then hatred [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=930.8s)]
*  Yeah, imagine if Ethan and Willie Mack put out videos tomorrow saying they were wrong about you. I would fucking I would lose my mind [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=934.32s)]
*  I would I don't know what I would do. I feel like I not a single [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=939.2800000000001s)]
*  I don't think a single one of my fucking active haters have ever turned around. I've been like, yeah [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=943.6s)]
*  We got this wrong. Actually my bad, you know, but can you imagine? K song said he was wrong [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=948.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, because he wasn't a fucking hater in the hater category [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=953.88s)]
*  K song was duped by all the fucking shit that he saw of me. Yeah, but have you seen the views on focus on videos? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=957.0400000000001s)]
*  They're not that great. Honestly, I think the fuck us on videos used to pop off way higher [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=962.16s)]
*  Yeah back in the day you get a good fuck us on video like two years ago [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=966.8s)]
*  I'd get a million views nowadays that shit is so boring and stale that like even the people that kind of wanted that content [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=970.8s)]
*  Are like they're just they're basically looking at it like yeah [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=977.24s)]
*  Yeah, people have essentially already made up their minds about you and and there's still plenty of people who haven't it's not necessarily that [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=979.88s)]
*  It's a saturated market, but I think people yeah [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=986.5600000000001s)]
*  I think that in the in the drama sphere, I think a lot of people are already like yeah, I already seen this [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=989.4399999999999s)]
*  I hate him like it's not new the widespread hate used to be a force field around you for me until I checked out your clips [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=995.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's the other side of this story though. Is that like if a single person were like, let me just see what this guy is about [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1001.4s)]
*  Let me see what this fucking dude is about. They would very quickly realize that they're just duped [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1008.72s)]
*  What's another crater and if you do you are a piece of shit and you should not be here [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1014.1999999999999s)]
*  But why is it now that you can just dunk on something that you don't know anything about you don't understand and you didn't bother to [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1017.92s)]
*  Research into why is that the normal Babylon priest? I'm making videos about you. That's as much of an apology as you're gonna get [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1023.28s)]
*  Yeah, that one was actually really interesting because like one of them is a kind of a destiny orbiter [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1029.32s)]
*  I don't know what their deal is now [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1034.2s)]
*  But like they got mad at me because I said they're they're you know [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1036.52s)]
*  Anti-trans stuff was just like they were making anti-trans content and they just like straight-up said I was actually transphobic [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1040.68s)]
*  And people believe that it was so wild, but I don't know what their [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1046.64s)]
*  I easy one bro for real hated your guts. You pulled me back them out [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1051.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I always wonder where people come from like how they how they arrive at like such passionate takes [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1055.5200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, but your haters too often have a tone of bigotry it took me a while to watch because I thought I was too far [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1069.3600000000001s)]
*  Left for you my bias [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1074.16s)]
*  Norm now, why is it that you just post first and research second? Oh, oh, I got some hate about this [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1076.3200000000002s)]
*  I'll take it down. Don't worry about the other 500 videos where I blindly made fun of people [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1081.64s)]
*  I don't understand the sad truth [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1085.2s)]
*  Now is that it seems like it's okay if you're a large creator to be a dick to anybody you want or don't like or don't [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1086.52s)]
*  Agree with you know, having a large audience is a huge huge responsibility whether we like it or not [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1092.28s)]
*  We are influences we influence people with our opinions and what we say [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1098.3200000000002s)]
*  I'm sure some people watching this video right now will be influenced by my opinion on all of this stuff [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1101.8s)]
*  That's that's how it goes [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1106.2s)]
*  But for some reason it's okay now to blindly hate others and send rabid fans to go and attack people and stuff [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1107.76s)]
*  They don't understand why it's hard enough just existing right now. It is horrible living in this year [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1114.08s)]
*  It is a miserable time to be alive [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1120.44s)]
*  Why are we making it our friends who told me you were problematic years ago? [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1122.72s)]
*  But after watching you for the past month or so you seem fine [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1126.76s)]
*  Yeah, that's like I did a satirical fucking a PUA dating show [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1129.24s)]
*  Eleven years ago at this point and we literally immediately deleted it too [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1137.04s)]
*  but some Nazis many many years ago unearthed them and [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1141.72s)]
*  Now people still use it to this day and it's so funny because like I look like a different human when you post it [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1146.12s)]
*  But yeah, um, I'm very open about [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1151.76s)]
*  Having like I talk about my consistency and my policies and my politics for a very long time and yeah for the past ten years [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1154.6799999999998s)]
*  and that has remained but [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1162.1999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, there no I definitely had I definitely had different points of view on on trans people. For example, it informs my commentary [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1164.8799999999999s)]
*  It's not something that I mean, I'm ashamed of it for sure because it doesn't represent who I am [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1172.24s)]
*  But you know, we all go through our own [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1177.8799999999999s)]
*  Experience of learning and developing and becoming better people it's something that I truly believe it's perhaps one of the most important principles that I apply in [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1181.32s)]
*  My commentaries you can grow and change and it's crazy that so many people are like nah, you're this actually you grift it [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1189.2s)]
*  It harder for everyone and if you're a Vtuber it is kind of just accepted now that you just get this level of blind hatred [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1196.6399999999999s)]
*  All the time. It's insane. Why is this? Okay? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1202.96s)]
*  Anyway moving on with the timeline since then mouse and I assume most of you tubers have had to deal with insult after insult [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1207.32s)]
*  That is normalized for mouse personally this level of hatred and vitriol [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1213.1599999999999s)]
*  Escalated another level when mouse was nominated for the Game Awards [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1217.32s)]
*  Another game awards have this category are for content creator of the year [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1221.28s)]
*  obviously this year had a [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1225.08s)]
*  Massive amount of very very big creators that I'm sure we're all familiar with [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1226.6799999999998s)]
*  But to the surprise of mouse and to most of us mouse got nominated and then this isn't saying the mouse didn't deserve it [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1230.76s)]
*  Mouse had an amazing year mouse had raised a ton of money for charity [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1236.68s)]
*  Had broken the all-time sub record for a woman on Twitch and had done just some of the most amazing shit when you consider [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1239.4s)]
*  The mouse is bedridden and has to have medication every single day that completely changes how any of this would be done and providing such [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1245.8s)]
*  An insane energy to every stream whilst battling a ton of medical issues that are permanent through a master's life [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1252.8s)]
*  I think the nomination is deserved and by some sheer miracle mouse had won the award [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1258.76s)]
*  It was a crazy achievement and nobody expected mouse to win to be honest because mouse was by far the smallest creator out of the ones [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1264.28s)]
*  That were nominated and the Game Award goes to iron mouse [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1271.6s)]
*  And sadly we're not in the matrix yet [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1278.84s)]
*  obviously these creators were massive and a lot of their fans that are watching the Game Awards were a [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1281.12s)]
*  Bit upset about mouse winning the award. This has led to a [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1285.96s)]
*  Constant [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1290.08s)]
*  Constant and I cannot preface enough a constant stream of hatred now that mouse had to deal with [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1291.04s)]
*  Openly on all of her socials for years now. This is the level of hatred that is normally like I gotta show you [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1296.56s)]
*  I gotta show you it's like ridiculous. This is 2022 back when mouse's comments were pretty normal [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1302.72s)]
*  I'd say as you can see here. This is beating Kai [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1306.8799999999999s)]
*  Okay, a little negative and unnecessary but not that bad this over Kai bro. Who are you? [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1310.3999999999999s)]
*  Luckily at this point not all the comments are like this [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1315.8799999999999s)]
*  But they're by far the most liked ones and it only gets worse the closer we get to today [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1318.52s)]
*  We're okay from that Kai video, right? This is number one streamer. No way blood. This is number one streamer [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1322.6s)]
*  This is who gets number one on Twitch. It's an evil world. We live in and you think okay, maybe something [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1327.52s)]
*  It's an evil world. We live in [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1331.84s)]
*  No, my god. I mean, they're probably 11 [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1335.2s)]
*  that's another thing that is really annoying about the internet is that [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1338.24s)]
*  So many of these people are just straight up 11, dude [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1342.6s)]
*  a lot of people fail to for fail to consider that so much of the [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1345.84s)]
*  Commentary online is being made by 11 year olds, you know, but because they're anonymous [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1350.9199999999998s)]
*  We just don't know [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1356.8s)]
*  Thing happened at the time. This has been pretty much constant until now. I gotta be speeding Kai on top [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1358.4399999999998s)]
*  How is the stream of the year? How is the stream of the year this one the award by the way? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1364.6799999999998s)]
*  Oh hell no, this is who won. No cap. Who's iron mass [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1368.2399999999998s)]
*  Brain rot this beat cipher PK game awards a while. Why did you win? No way this one creative the year? [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1371.44s)]
*  I'm crying this literally goes on and on and you think okay look [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1377.12s)]
*  It's because mouse won the streamer of the year. It probably stops after that [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1382.24s)]
*  Oh, no, so many people like posters on Instagram reels posters on reels [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1386.22s)]
*  Oh, yeah, great cuz love that love being toxic on Instagram, bro. Who are you? I'm begging you [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1389.6399999999999s)]
*  Please post this on Instagram. Why do we just want to be so cruel? What the fuck? [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1394.52s)]
*  Just chill the fan man with the is watching this this thing has the most subs on twitch [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1397.5600000000002s)]
*  How did you beat Kai? No human being on the planet wearing this? [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1401.98s)]
*  Okay, why I wear it in fire? Okay, geez on my life. I've never in my entire life seen a single stream [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1405.24s)]
*  Why do you care? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1410.8000000000002s)]
*  Why like if I just haven't seen something I just don't interact [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1412.7s)]
*  I don't understand what has happened where we all feel the need to say our opinion and be like yeah guys [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1416.68s)]
*  We hate this right who cares you're a loser [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1423.58s)]
*  This has gone on for months has pretty much just led to Mouse just not posting on tik-tok [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1426.02s)]
*  Which I feel is really fucked up you can just successfully bully a massive creator off a platform [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1430.78s)]
*  The reason why this will happen by the way is just because Mouse won an award [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1436.3999999999999s)]
*  What this is just the stuff that mouse gets on her own socials [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1441.5s)]
*  This doesn't include the hatred that she receives from just existing in those posts from those low [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1444.5s)]
*  I'm with C dog why interact if you don't watch it becomes content in and of itself a lot of people are desperately seeking out [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1449.6399999999999s)]
*  validation seeking out a sense of purpose seeking out a community and [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1456.32s)]
*  The thing is this kind of like hate campaigns [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1460.08s)]
*  Makes people feel like they are a part of something larger. Does that make sense? Honestly watching this is shitty [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1464.36s)]
*  But it really reminds me how much hate you get. Yeah, I mean, it's fine [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1469.96s)]
*  I think of this every time the hate comment post discourse happens and remains evergreen [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1472.48s)]
*  I remember I got into an argument on reddit a while ago with a person over Italian food [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1477.2s)]
*  It got to the point they were following me into other subs to harass me [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1480.44s)]
*  I clicked on their profile to block them and their most recent post was them drinking their own piss on r slash piss [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1483.1599999999999s)]
*  At that moment I realized I had spent too much pointless time arguing about the taste of food with someone who drinks their own piss [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1489.3999999999999s)]
*  As a hobby this site is a shithole. Yeah [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1495.44s)]
*  looking at someone's like [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1498.8s)]
*  reddit [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1500.52s)]
*  history is a very [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1501.82s)]
*  Quick way to get you to understand like oh, I'm not dealing with like a normal person [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1504.34s)]
*  I'm dealing with like a person with severe mental illness [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1508.34s)]
*  Oftentimes, it's a oftentimes a destiny poster that also probably posts on r slash piss talking about how they drink their own piss [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1512.1s)]
*  Would you argue the reddit is more toxic than Twitter? No Twitter is [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1519.3s)]
*  Infinitely more toxic. Are you kidding me? Twitter is like perma Nazi reddit still has I got attacked by a D man fan only [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1523.1799999999998s)]
*  Look at his reddit to see that he had a post begging for food a porn. Yeah [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1529.86s)]
*  And the thing is like I doubt Kai is on board with this fucking hate brigading [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1533.82s)]
*  He would not he would not be on board with some [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1540.58s)]
*  superpower like [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1543.62s)]

*  like [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1547.74s)]

*  That's a good idea sort of like I should do it for a good cause like and put some money towards it cuz like it feels [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1557.5s)]
*  Super cool to help my family out first that felt good. But the fact that you can help [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1562.7s)]
*  Somebody who doesn't even know you or like this [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1567.42s)]
*  Amazing. Yeah, I don't think it's that deep for Kai fan slash normies people just get very overly reactive on social media comments like Instagram [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1570.74s)]
*  Take talk. That's true [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1576.78s)]
*  He isn't but he doesn't even tell his fans to stop doing it that he encourages or that he encourages it [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1577.78s)]
*  Even though they might listen it's still a sign that he doesn't condone any of the shit his fans are doing or saying to her [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1582.1000000000001s)]
*  I doubt it because then you're taking one. You might not know it too [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1586.54s)]
*  It looks like you're taking ownership over something that is not that that you have not brought about [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1591.54s)]
*  He's called it his fans over the hate on Iron Maus [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1596.8999999999999s)]
*  Strauss just sold his us taking Sabra food manufacturer souls [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1599.62s)]
*  Oh, no food manufacturers. So is holding and joint venture after declining sales amid fierce competition and uptick in the anti-israel [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1602.52s)]
*  Boycott campaign in the u.s. Oh, no pour one out [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1608.4599999999998s)]

*  I think we should ban twitch we should ban twitch in its entirety and maybe maybe people will be [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1618.42s)]
*  Forced to like Sabra or something. I don't fucking know [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1624.7s)]

*  Unfortunately, a lot of people were just being blindly hateful and of course this level of hatred doesn't just stay on the platforms [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1680.04s)]

*  Yeah [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1738.0800000000002s)]
*  I think [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1738.6000000000001s)]
*  under the guise of anonymity a lot of people behave in ways that they never would in public if they were actually [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1739.96s)]
*  Face-to-face with the person that they're speaking to and it's become super normalized. And once again, like I said [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1744.72s)]
*  We are increasingly isolated isolated from one another. We're increasingly alienated from one another and [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1751.3200000000002s)]
*  in that process [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1757.8400000000001s)]
*  We're like desperately seeking out a sense of community a sense of order a sense of purpose [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1758.8000000000002s)]
*  And I think that like mass brigading this way and engaging in like hate campaigns this way is [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1762.16s)]
*  It gives people the feeling of like doing something read the first comment on this video [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1768.52s)]
*  Didn't even mention the most ludicrous detail [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1773.64s)]
*  She got all of the hate for something she wasn't even trying to be strangers nominated her [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1775.48s)]
*  Strangers voted for her and she won because strangers decided so imagine hearing some stranger talk about a pizza place [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1779.0s)]
*  They really like and your reaction is to go to said piece of place and start loudly yelling about how it's not your favorite [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1784.0s)]
*  Pizza place and telling the owner to die these people are dumber than dirt. Yep [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1788.8799999999999s)]
*  This is this is this is [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1793.68s)]
*  100% I want to make this clear. I'm not blaming any crazy [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1796.32s)]
*  Obviously, we saw a lot of people name-dropping Kai saying how could this lose to Kai and all that stuff? [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1799.0s)]
*  This is not me blaming Kai in any capacity [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1802.96s)]
*  I think his audience is at the size that is absolutely absurd and then at that level you can try and tell your viewers [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1805.84s)]
*  Hey, man, look be respectful which which Kai has on numerous times. He's openly praised. Yeah, there you go [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1812.56s)]
*  Mike [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1817.64s)]
*  Ironmouse and been very supportive towards small creators. Ironmouse has always been top five all time [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1818.64s)]
*  She's somebody I had to pass during my first summer time that I know people are defensive [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1823.2s)]
*  I know a lot of people defend me and shit like that [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1827.3600000000001s)]
*  But Chad if you actually looked at her stream and actually kept away with you doing you feel what I'm saying? [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1828.88s)]
*  Not only was it for a good cause, but it was pretty well put together [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1833.2s)]
*  But obviously, you know as a creator you do still have some influence over your viewers [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1836.92s)]
*  I think it's important to make sure that when you see this behavior in the community that you call it out [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1840.52s)]
*  I'm not entirely sure when this happened online, but it feels like it's okay [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1843.9199999999998s)]
*  You just blindly make fun or hate something you don't understand or have not learned anything about [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1847.86s)]
*  But I guess that is more of a reflection of the current times we live in because everyone seems to do that all the time [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1853.6s)]
*  As a creator, I would be embarrassed if I saw my viewers blindly hating on someone else using my name [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1857.98s)]
*  I would be mortified if I online harassment is part of the language of being online now kids who are online and second-nature [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1863.28s)]
*  For them to harass in my opinion [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1868.52s)]
*  I know it's really fucking crazy, dude [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1869.84s)]
*  a lot of stuff that I think was relegated to the depths of 4chan are now very [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1872.1999999999998s)]
*  Normalized like whether it be looks maxing PUA and all these like concepts that used to be [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1878.1999999999998s)]
*  just in like bodybuilding forums and in incredibly niche spaces and that [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1883.72s)]
*  Now people just like do it openly I saw that and and the one good thing about all you guys is that I know [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1890.72s)]
*  That you don't do that [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1896.72s)]
*  I appreciate that because you're all cool and you're all normally well adjusted [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1897.6399999999999s)]
*  The fact that so many of these online trolls or adolescents need to be really examined [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1901.96s)]
*  I believe that it is their way to feel a sense of agency when they're going through a developmental phase in which so many feel [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1905.76s)]
*  powerless not having control over their lives [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1909.96s)]
*  Parents needs to address this with their kids when they find out they are bullying online [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1911.96s)]
*  the fact that yeah, I agree the great take I [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1916.12s)]
*  also don't necessarily know how to [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1919.76s)]
*  Like regulate this sort of thing [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1922.72s)]
*  Yeah, the death of forums and the increased centralized nature of the internet due to social media forced it into mainstream net stuff [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1924.4s)]
*  it's so funny because like what what Connor's talking about here is literally my daily existence every single day for the past five six years now and [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1929.44s)]

*  Other vtubers or any other even youtubers if you've experienced this same kind of level of blind hatred yourself [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U047eIQMrnc&t=1983.68s)]
