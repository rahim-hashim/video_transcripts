# Discusses American Militarism And Its Impact | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6QgCyJKfow)
*  Found the Russian guy. He actually is a cop with veterans affairs and lives in Miami. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6QgCyJKfow&t=0.0s)]
*  Leo Pavlushkin. That's amazing. We, we imported the hog. We imported the hog and made it hard, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6QgCyJKfow&t=4.0s)]
*  made it our own. I love that. Yes. Mike is the vet from the famous Obama presidency protests or was [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6QgCyJKfow&t=11.52s)]
*  it Bush or cyber trucks whistling diesel to the cyber truck durability test too. Okay. Too soon, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6QgCyJKfow&t=18.16s)]
*  brother. Too soon. Take friend of the show. Mike had a opinion on veterans, active duty and [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6QgCyJKfow&t=28.4s)]
*  active duty military members and also veterans and how the likelihood of them becoming radicalized [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6QgCyJKfow&t=38.48s)]
*  and doing something very violent is fairly high. Let's take a look at what he had to say. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6QgCyJKfow&t=45.36s)]
*  The number one predictor of becoming what is called a casualty offender, surpassing even [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6QgCyJKfow&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  mental health issues as a profiler. You know, there are many different consequences of having [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6QgCyJKfow&t=56.8s)]
*  a massive military empire. The biggest humanity has ever seen both in its sheer size, its expanse [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6QgCyJKfow&t=62.559999999999995s)]
*  around the world. One that is a constantly engaged in endless and morally indefensible [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6QgCyJKfow&t=68.16s)]
*  wars around the world. And one of those consequences is the violence abroad coming back [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6QgCyJKfow&t=73.6s)]
*  against people at home. Leibnizberger, of course, his career was one of, of, of, and then, you know, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6QgCyJKfow&t=77.75999999999999s)]
*  the New Orleans attacker says he was inspired by the mass ideology of this would not exist [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6QgCyJKfow&t=84.39999999999999s)]
*  were it not for the U.S. military's complete destruction of Iraq and mass killing of innocent [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6QgCyJKfow&t=91.2s)]
*  people. You know, America in general, of course, has a mass violence problem. Mass [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6QgCyJKfow&t=96.47999999999999s)]
*  things happen quite regularly, more than once a day on average. And that the reasons for that [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6QgCyJKfow&t=100.47999999999999s)]
*  are linked to U.S. militarism, both in that kind of cultural domination of a country that glorifies [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6QgCyJKfow&t=106.64s)]
*  violence and exports violence, but more so a government that is presiding over a country [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6QgCyJKfow&t=112.16s)]
*  with deep and extreme social problems while, which it refuses to address while having a blank [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6QgCyJKfow&t=117.36s)]
*  and endless check for militarism abroad and an ever increasing budget for the military industrial [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6QgCyJKfow&t=123.84s)]
*  complex. And so this gives rise to an extreme amount of social problems in our society that [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6QgCyJKfow&t=129.68s)]
*  are rooted in things like alienation and inequality and desperation and despair and hopelessness. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6QgCyJKfow&t=134.64s)]
*  And then so the U.S. military comes in and for the purposes of recruitment must target people who [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6QgCyJKfow&t=139.84s)]
*  are most impacted by those social problems. They bring them into an institution where they [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6QgCyJKfow&t=144.72s)]
*  train them to kill. They train them that killing is actually quite honorable and quite cool. It [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6QgCyJKfow&t=149.2s)]
*  sends many of those people to kill abroad. You know, it has a notoriously, very notorious for [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6QgCyJKfow&t=155.44s)]
*  ruining people's mental health and a mental health system that makes people's mental health problems [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6QgCyJKfow&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  even worse and then spits them back out into a society where people find their lives [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6QgCyJKfow&t=167.12s)]
*  harder than when they join. That's kind of why I think that has become a number one predictor [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6QgCyJKfow&t=171.6s)]
*  of becoming a mass casualty offender is all of those, all of those consequences. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6QgCyJKfow&t=176.08s)]
*  And military found the Russian guy. He actually is a cop with Veterans Affairs and lives in Miami. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6QgCyJKfow&t=180.32s)]
*  Leo Pavlushkin. That's amazing. We imported the hog. We imported the hog and made it our own. I [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6QgCyJKfow&t=185.52s)]
*  love that. Yes. Mike is the vet from the famous Obama presidency protest or was it Bush? I mean, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6QgCyJKfow&t=194.24s)]
*  he has also protested against what Bush. He recently yelled at Bush a couple like a year [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6QgCyJKfow&t=201.52s)]
*  ago, a couple of years ago, we called him a criminal. But yeah, this was incredible. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6QgCyJKfow&t=208.4s)]
*  I wanted to show you what Mike had to say for end of the show, but also I have some, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6QgCyJKfow&t=215.36s)]
*  some more interesting takes. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6QgCyJKfow&t=221.76s)]
