# Maya And Hasan Interviewed About Fundraising On Twitch
**HasanAbi:** [September 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg)
*  How much did you raise on something? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=0.0s)]
*  50,000. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1.12s)]
*  Oh my gosh! [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it's not that you got- [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2.88s)]
*  You got a hundred grand just by standing there from Twitch. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=4.4s)]
*  They only gave me ten. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=7.84s)]
*  They do like me more. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=9.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=10.88s)]
*  Thank you, Seth, everybody. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=11.56s)]
*  Slurs you normally say when referring to me and my people. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=18.16s)]
*  Hi everyone! [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=30.96s)]
*  Hello! [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=32.08s)]
*  Let's just start this conversation by saying that I'm sorry. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=32.72s)]
*  I did not prepare for this even a little bit. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=37.12s)]
*  And Maya has been freaking out for the past like three- [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=40.64s)]
*  Actually, I was gonna say past three weeks, but you've been freaking out about us coming on stage [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=44.56s)]
*  and having this Q&A, having this talk for months at this point. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=49.84s)]
*  You keep texting me about it. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  I've texted his phone like three times. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=56.08s)]
*  He hasn't responded to any of that. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=58.0s)]
*  That's the most amount of follow-up I've ever gotten. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=59.12s)]
*  Today's the first day that we talked about this panel. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=61.04s)]
*  So I want to do a good job. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=63.44s)]
*  His son's not stressed. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=65.12s)]
*  He feels fine. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=66.24s)]
*  He doesn't care. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=66.8s)]
*  I'm a yapper. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=67.6s)]
*  I'm a great A yapper. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=68.32s)]
*  And we're talking about something that's like very important to both of us. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=69.67999999999999s)]
*  So I feel like it's not really something that we needed to prepare for, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=74.56s)]
*  especially because we're talking about making change on Twitch. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=79.92s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=83.44s)]
*  Everybody, I hope you guys are having a great time by the way. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=84.0s)]
*  TwitchCon San Diego, let's hear it! [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=86.32s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=88.32s)]
*  Fantastic. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=89.19999999999999s)]
*  A lot of change makers in this room. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=90.88s)]
*  So like I said, this is something that's very important. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=92.55999999999999s)]
*  This is literally what you do with Alveus. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  And this is something that I've also tried to do to the best of my ability [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  with my community, with the fundraising initiatives that we have engaged in. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=104.32s)]
*  We raised $1.3 million in the first couple of weeks after October 7 for Palestinian families. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=110.0s)]
*  Free Palestine. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=118.56s)]
*  Same thing. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=119.76s)]
*  Whenever horrifying disasters happen anywhere around the world, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=120.72s)]
*  I always feel a sense of powerlessness because I'm here in America [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=127.12s)]
*  and very fortunate, very privileged to be here just like all of you. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=131.68s)]
*  And one thing that I've realized is when I'm speaking to these issues, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=135.52s)]
*  when I'm speaking to these ongoing atrocities or devastating earthquakes, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=140.64s)]
*  like the one that hit Turkey and northern Syria, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=145.12s)]
*  I found that fundraising is a really phenomenal vehicle for change in terms of like [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=149.36s)]
*  maybe overcoming that sense of powerlessness that you feel in the face of, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=155.68s)]
*  you know, horrifying inequalities or devastating things that occur. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  So I think that is a wonderful aspect of Twitch streaming in general. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=164.96s)]
*  And I wanted to ask you, Maya, if you feel the same way. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=170.96s)]
*  I do. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=175.44s)]
*  Hassan and I, the topics that we cover are very different, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=176.0s)]
*  but I think our methods are very similar. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=179.6s)]
*  So as probably a lot of you know, hopefully a lot of you know, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=181.28s)]
*  I have an animal sanctuary, Alvea Sanctuary, it's very nice. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  That's in Austin, Texas. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=188.8s)]
*  It is entirely built off of Twitch as a platform. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=190.16s)]
*  And it's so special to be able to educate people about conservation on Twitch [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=193.84s)]
*  because you guys are budding conscious consumers and voters and environmental advocates. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=196.96s)]
*  And so it's a really special demographic to be able to teach. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=202.8s)]
*  And that's why I love Twitch and I have a lot of fun doing it. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=206.0s)]
*  But Hassan and I do a lot of education on Twitch and a lot of activism and a ton of fundraising. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=209.04000000000002s)]
*  It has been incredible to be on this platform. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=214.08s)]
*  Yeah, I think one aspect of live streaming in particular [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=216.88000000000002s)]
*  that lends itself so perfectly to fundraising and also awareness and education [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=221.36s)]
*  is the immediacy and the sense of community that you can create from said immediacy of the medium. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=227.84s)]
*  Like I feel like I started off my career at the Young Turks where I would make Facebook videos, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=235.12s)]
*  right? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=242.23999999999998s)]
*  And also YouTube videos for the Young Turks. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=242.88s)]
*  And I never got that immediate feedback that I would get from a chat. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=245.44s)]
*  And I think that back and forth and that immediate feedback is really good. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=251.68s)]
*  Especially if you use it for good, especially if you use it to educate your community on best practices [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=257.6s)]
*  and use every opportunity as an educational moment. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=263.92s)]
*  You can foster a community of like-minded individuals that truly care about the issues. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=269.76000000000005s)]
*  And I think you've done a wonderful job with that, especially at Albea's. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=274.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, it's also so it's great for conservation education too. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=279.44s)]
*  Before I started streaming, I was working at Zoom. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=283.68s)]
*  So you guys are the people that have like the safari hat and bring the snakes out to [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=285.6s)]
*  birthday parties and introduce. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=289.44s)]
*  So I was doing that traditional conservation education outreach. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=290.96000000000004s)]
*  And with Twitch and streaming, we're able to do that. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=294.64000000000004s)]
*  Albea's is reaching about 30 million people a year now, which is very, very cool. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=297.04s)]
*  But our animals aren't leaving our facility. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=300.72s)]
*  So we don't have to do any of that transport. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=302.8s)]
*  They don't really have to meet a bunch of new people, but they're still affecting so many. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=304.8s)]
*  So that model for us has been perfect also. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=308.8s)]
*  So at this point, do we ask, do we give a microphone to people in the community to ask questions? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=313.12s)]
*  Oh, they do. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=319.92s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=320.72s)]
*  I'm seeing some people on that side. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=321.04s)]
*  You ain't got nobody on your side. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=323.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=324.40000000000003s)]
*  So this is Hassan's microphone line. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=324.64000000000004s)]
*  If you have questions for Hassan, you're going to line up over there. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=326.72s)]
*  If you have questions for me, you're going to line up over here. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=328.96000000000004s)]
*  We're going to alternate between them. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=331.20000000000005s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=333.6s)]
*  Start over here. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=333.84000000000003s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=334.72s)]
*  We'll get started. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=334.96000000000004s)]
*  Boy, does that mean I can't ask you any questions? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=335.76000000000005s)]
*  You can ask me a question. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=338.0s)]
*  You can ask her. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=338.8s)]
*  Well, I want to ask Hassan questions first. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=339.44000000000005s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=341.52s)]
*  What's happening? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=341.76s)]
*  What's good, Hassan? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=342.64s)]
*  First of all, I want to say thank you for all the work you did with the Baylor. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=343.84s)]
*  That shit was fire. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=346.79999999999995s)]
*  Congratulations for raising the money. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=348.24s)]
*  I appreciate people like you that use your platform to push initiatives that help change [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=352.0s)]
*  the world and make an effect on the community. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=356.88s)]
*  So. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=358.79999999999995s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=359.12s)]
*  Thank you for watching. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=359.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=360.47999999999996s)]
*  I'm a big fan and I've actually trolled you before in the chat. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=361.12s)]
*  So I'm sure you'll check. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=364.0s)]
*  She checked me on something to remember. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=365.84s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=367.28s)]
*  Actually, don't look at that. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=367.76s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=368.64s)]
*  I can't see from over here. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=369.28s)]
*  It was all a good fun. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=370.24s)]
*  I want to ask you is how do small streamers like myself, you know, kind of like under 200 [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=373.12s)]
*  followers use our platform and our small communities to try to drive some change? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=378.8s)]
*  Like, for example, for me, I had an ambulance situation last year. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=385.6s)]
*  I'm kind of a young guy, so I was like caught me off guard and I got a bill for the ambulance. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=391.2s)]
*  Have you guys ever been? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=396.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=397.44s)]
*  The EMS bills are crazy. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=398.88s)]
*  So then that became like something I was like really passionate about. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=400.8s)]
*  I wrote a letter to the councilman, Krikorian in L.A. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=403.92s)]
*  and also wrote a letter to the mayor as well. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=407.44s)]
*  Didn't get any response. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=410.24s)]
*  But like, how do people from our level, you know, down here get like engagement from [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=411.2s)]
*  people who can make change? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=417.04s)]
*  I think that everything that I do, one thing that I always repeat is like I'd be saying [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=418.32s)]
*  the exact same things even if I had 30 people watching and I was saying the exact same thing [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=424.0s)]
*  when I first started with 30 people watching. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=428.72s)]
*  I think ultimately the impact that you have, even if it's on one person, is still very [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=430.88000000000005s)]
*  significant and you have to remind yourself of that and keep putting your best foot forward [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=436.56s)]
*  no matter what and not bring size into the equation at all. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=441.6s)]
*  I don't think it's an issue that you have a smaller community. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=445.76000000000005s)]
*  I think what you're doing as a citizen is impactful individually. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=449.44000000000005s)]
*  But beyond that, the fact that you can motivate other people and you can bring awareness to [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=455.44s)]
*  certain problems like that, especially in terms of healthcare, like what you just said [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=460.24s)]
*  about the EMS, like what you said about ambulance is like that was a massive point of radicalization [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=464.24s)]
*  for myself as well. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=470.0s)]
*  Like I took for granted a nationalized healthcare system in Turkey when I was growing up. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=470.88s)]
*  There's also a private aspect to it as well. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=476.32s)]
*  You can get private healthcare in Turkey as well and go to private hospitals. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=478.72s)]
*  When I came to America and that option was taken away, I was like, holy, this is like [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=482.4s)]
*  $5,000 to go to the hospital. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=486.64s)]
*  Like it's insane. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=488.56s)]
*  I think it's great that you now have a platform that you can speak to that and get other people [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=492.4s)]
*  on board as well. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=499.2s)]
*  You can participate in larger projects. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=501.59999999999997s)]
*  Oftentimes when we're doing these sorts of fundraisers, everybody pitches in. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=504.56s)]
*  One thing that I always stress is it doesn't matter if you're only giving a dollar, right? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=509.68s)]
*  That is still going towards a broader cause. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=514.88s)]
*  That's still going towards a larger cause. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=517.2s)]
*  I think every single person matters in that regard. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=519.04s)]
*  Keep up the good work. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=523.6800000000001s)]
*  I appreciate you telling me size doesn't matter when you came in here like 6'6". [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=525.28s)]
*  It doesn't. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=531.28s)]
*  It doesn't. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=531.76s)]
*  Okay, we're going to go over here. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=532.4s)]
*  Hi. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=533.52s)]
*  So I'm a teacher and Maya, I wanted to ask you about kind of tips for teaching the future [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=534.9s)]
*  generations about conservancy. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=540.9s)]
*  I am actually an art teacher, but I do a lot with sustainability in my classroom. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=543.86s)]
*  So I just wanted to ask you about that. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=548.42s)]
*  Wonderful. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=550.5s)]
*  Cool. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=551.3s)]
*  So I'll give a little more of a rundown of El Vez. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=552.5799999999999s)]
*  So we rescue animal ambassadors and they all represent different areas of places we want [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=555.46s)]
*  to teach people, right? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=561.14s)]
*  So we have foxes, we teach people about the fur trade. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=561.86s)]
*  We have parrots, we teach people about the pet trade. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=564.1800000000001s)]
*  And I think that ambassador model is really, really powerful. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=566.98s)]
*  So especially with kids, if you want to teach them about keeping waterways clean, even if [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=569.86s)]
*  it's a cartoon, like having a frog and saying his name is Georgie, for example. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=575.94s)]
*  Georgie. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=581.78s)]
*  He loves Georgie. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=583.3000000000001s)]
*  But giving them something to connect to makes them care about it a lot more. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=584.9s)]
*  That's what we do at El Vez. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=588.4200000000001s)]
*  They care about the ambassador and then care about their wild counterpart. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=589.94s)]
*  So that's my best advice for you. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=593.22s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=595.3000000000001s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=596.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=596.4200000000001s)]
*  She's saying kidnap some animals. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=597.0600000000001s)]
*  Find them and then get the kids to pet the animals. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=598.9s)]
*  I said even if it's a cartoon, you can use Georgie if you want. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=602.4200000000001s)]
*  Great. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=606.58s)]
*  Georgie. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=606.98s)]
*  He's live 24-7 on El Vez. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=608.26s)]
*  Thanks for your attention. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=610.1s)]
*  All right. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=611.46s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=612.1s)]
*  Hi. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=613.62s)]
*  My name is Monizy. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=613.94s)]
*  Love you guys both so much. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=615.3000000000001s)]
*  Been a fan for a long time. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=616.82s)]
*  Thanks for what you guys are doing. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=618.02s)]
*  This is a two-part question. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=620.1s)]
*  One is kind of about the future of fundraising on Twitch. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=621.9399999999999s)]
*  So as you guys both raise money all the time through Twitch, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=625.46s)]
*  if you could fix and or implement like one thing on the platform that could improve that for [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=629.62s)]
*  just overall reach, if that means like insert charity here is included, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=635.6999999999999s)]
*  what would that look like? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=640.02s)]
*  And secondly, how do kind of following up on his question, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=641.38s)]
*  secondary, like how do smaller creators use that to do more effective change [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=645.86s)]
*  rather than just like momentary monetary support? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=651.38s)]
*  I was looking at you for some reason. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=655.14s)]
*  I was like maybe you got this. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=656.58s)]
*  I actually really like a lot of Twitch features for fundraising. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=658.1s)]
*  So El Vez is on Twitch charity, which is wonderful because then they donate through Twitch [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=661.54s)]
*  and then we get it in a grant separately and so it's all very clean and nice. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=666.74s)]
*  Twitch is really powerful for fundraising because of what Missonne was talking about earlier, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=670.4200000000001s)]
*  that immediate they donate and you say thank you blank, you know, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=674.18s)]
*  there's a connection there, which is really cool. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=677.6999999999999s)]
*  The only thing that comes into mind, which would be cool, but is not necessary, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=680.66s)]
*  is like badges potentially. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=684.7399999999999s)]
*  Like if you're doing a stream, if you can set a badge, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=686.9799999999999s)]
*  like this person has donated this much, they get a special badge during that stream. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=689.54s)]
*  A really cool Twitch viewers also really like the I was there concept. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=693.9399999999999s)]
*  So if there's like a badge for being at a fundraising stream and participating in it [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=699.4599999999999s)]
*  and you have it for like a month or something like that would be neat. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=702.98s)]
*  Damn, that was brilliant. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=706.58s)]
*  I got no nose on that, honestly, because we use a lot of third party facilitators in this process. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=707.62s)]
*  We use Tiltify on my stream for a lot of the fundraisers that we're engaging in [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=714.66s)]
*  and I don't know if like substituting that out for like a Twitch facilitated processor [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=721.14s)]
*  would be better or worse overall, but I think Tiltify works fairly well, you know. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=725.62s)]
*  So I have no issues on that front. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=732.1s)]
*  I think a little bit more integration, like whether it be a third party application [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=734.66s)]
*  or more integration from Twitch's side in terms of like setting markers, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=739.9399999999999s)]
*  having those markers appear integrated in the user interface [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=744.8199999999999s)]
*  would probably be one additional note that I would add on to that. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=748.5799999999999s)]
*  But as far as like small content creators, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=753.22s)]
*  I feel like this is a question that's going to come up a lot. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=757.62s)]
*  I want to stress that over and over again, like everything that you're doing, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=760.5s)]
*  even if you are a small content creator, an up and coming content creator, right, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=765.38s)]
*  and you have a certain set of values and someone comes into your chat [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=770.5s)]
*  and violates those boundaries, right. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=774.34s)]
*  Like let's say you want to ensure that you want to create as safe of an educational space [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=776.34s)]
*  as possible for marginalized communities, right, like trans people, for example. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=781.62s)]
*  And someone comes in and does something that goes beyond a microaggression [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=786.42s)]
*  and is not like genuinely charitable and is actually harmful to the overall discourse. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=790.9s)]
*  When you stop that, that in its tracks, and you speak out against that [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=795.54s)]
*  and use that as an educational opportunity, you are teaching, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=800.26s)]
*  however many people are in your chat, that that is not right and that it is wrong [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=805.2199999999999s)]
*  and that those are your boundaries. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=809.38s)]
*  And I think that creates a really positive environment overall, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=810.98s)]
*  at least in my experience. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=815.46s)]
*  And I think that's the reason why we conduct a survey every year in my community, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=816.9000000000001s)]
*  the Hassanabi census. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=823.7800000000001s)]
*  And my community is majority queer and 14% as a matter of fact, or 15% now, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=825.5400000000001s)]
*  my community is trans. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=832.6600000000001s)]
*  I mean that is massively overrepresented in comparison to like trans people overall [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=834.34s)]
*  in the American population. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=840.9000000000001s)]
*  And a reason for that is not because I speak to trans issues on a regular basis, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=842.74s)]
*  as a matter of fact, I don't. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=846.82s)]
*  But that is because it is obviously an environment where trans people feel comfortable [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=849.22s)]
*  being themselves, knowing full well that like someone is not going to be able to attack them. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=855.7s)]
*  And I think fostering a community like that is also very important [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=860.26s)]
*  beyond like doing fundraisers for specific issues. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=863.3s)]
*  Awesome. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=867.78s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=869.3s)]
*  No problem. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=870.58s)]
*  Okay, over here. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=871.64s)]
*  Hey, so I was recently elected to the board of a nonprofit, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=873.1600000000001s)]
*  and I'm going to start running the Twitch channel for it. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=879.4000000000001s)]
*  But I also want to do like my own channel, and like you have both like kind of working, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=881.72s)]
*  I'm just kind of wondering visiting challenges that you can face during that process. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=888.36s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=893.5600000000001s)]
*  So some challenges it's mostly been incredible, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=894.9200000000001s)]
*  because my platform, my main platform, Maya, acts as a funnel for Albeus still, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=899.8s)]
*  because it's a much larger platform. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=907.0s)]
*  So I'm able to bring a bunch of people that watch the just chatting content [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=908.76s)]
*  and like meeting on Hassan's stream and stuff like that to Albeus, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=912.84s)]
*  which is really, really neat challenges there. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=916.92s)]
*  I think it's super not traditional. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=919.48s)]
*  So I might be on Hassan's stream eating mealworms and drinking and swearing and what, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=921.8s)]
*  you know, whatever. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=927.88s)]
*  And that's not necessarily representative. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=929.0799999999999s)]
*  You still owe me a collab, by the way, but you know this. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=930.28s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=933.0799999999999s)]
*  You do. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=933.8s)]
*  Oh, a trash cleanup? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=934.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=936.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=936.68s)]
*  We're going to clean up trash together. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=937.64s)]
*  He's really worried about it. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=939.24s)]
*  That was not my first. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=940.52s)]
*  That was not my first choice of how to collab, but. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=942.4399999999999s)]
*  We're going to pick up trash together. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=945.4s)]
*  He's going to love it. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=946.4399999999999s)]
*  So the challenge there potentially is that that brand that Maya is not necessarily [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=947.64s)]
*  representative of the brand that Albeus is as an educational nonprofit. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=954.28s)]
*  They're very different. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=957.9599999999999s)]
*  All that being said, I have kept doing it the way that I started doing it [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=959.64s)]
*  because I think it makes me a better educator. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=963.4s)]
*  Weirdly, I always compare it to people reading something on a billboard, right? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=965.48s)]
*  As you're driving by, you're probably not going to soak it in. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=969.9599999999999s)]
*  But if there's someone that you know, that's really passionate about something [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=972.76s)]
*  and they're talking to you about it and they're like, I love this so much. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=975.56s)]
*  You're going to remember it better. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=978.1999999999999s)]
*  So I think it makes me a better educator. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=980.1999999999999s)]
*  So there's there's give and take there. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=981.64s)]
*  But that's my answer. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=983.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=985.16s)]
*  Hey, Hanzan. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=985.48s)]
*  Thank you for all you do for the community. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=987.32s)]
*  We spend so much time watching you when you're part of our daily lives [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=989.32s)]
*  and we appreciate all the energy that you give for that. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=993.16s)]
*  Your point of view and your voice are super meaningful for us. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=995.72s)]
*  Each fan and love everything you do for charity. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=998.84s)]
*  I think many of us were waiting for the other day [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1002.6s)]
*  when you were finally cream pie by Austin show for charity. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1005.08s)]
*  So thank you. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1008.76s)]
*  Super big highlight. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1009.96s)]
*  Yeah, that really did happen. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1011.48s)]
*  The dry cleaner was like they gave me a call this morning feverishly [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1015.08s)]
*  and were like, we've never seen so much cream on pants. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1019.72s)]
*  Like I don't like because I overnighted it. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1024.1200000000001s)]
*  I was like, oh, we got can we get can I get like overnight express like cleaning on this? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1026.84s)]
*  And they call me they're like, we're going to need more time. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1031.08s)]
*  So, you know, Austin participated in that. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1033.48s)]
*  And so did you guys by donating. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1036.92s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1038.52s)]
*  Once again, we raised fifty thousand dollars last night at debate boards for multiple charities. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1039.24s)]
*  How much did you raise? [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1045.4s)]
*  I was like, oh my gosh. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1046.04s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's nothing you got. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1048.36s)]
*  You got a hundred grand just by standing there from the way they only gave me ten. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1049.8s)]
*  They do like me more. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1055.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1056.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1057.0s)]
*  So my question was that I know that me and many of your community are curious about charity [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1058.68s)]
*  and we applaud all you do. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1063.48s)]
*  We have a burning need to know how many subs at the top of the hour do we need to hit to reduce [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1065.96s)]
*  the gameplay at the end of your streams? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1070.84s)]
*  So, you know, for charity so we can focus more on politics. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1073.72s)]
*  You got you hit me at you hit me at two forty nine. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1077.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1080.84s)]
*  Normally I would be banning you. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1081.08s)]
*  I'd be banning you normally. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1083.8s)]
*  Wait, that's that's the only question you wanted to serve me a three minute break. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1085.48s)]
*  For seriously, I mean, I was previewing it for you. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1088.44s)]
*  But how do you get inspired for new charity ideas that cut through the noise of this space in general? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1091.24s)]
*  I have a really dark answer for this, unfortunately, and that is that [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1097.56s)]
*  everything is up all the time and things unfortunately never change for the better, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1101.8s)]
*  seemingly. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1106.76s)]
*  But I'm a firm believer in betting in putting your best foot forward. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1107.8s)]
*  And I consistently repeat, consistently reiterate that society can only foster if old men plant [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1112.2s)]
*  seeds for trees that will never sit in the shade of. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1121.72s)]
*  So I guess like it's a target rich environment out there. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1124.84s)]
*  There's a lot of suffering going on. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1129.4s)]
*  So, you know, every day I speak to these issues and sometimes some of those become very pressing [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1131.4s)]
*  matters. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1138.2s)]
*  And and that's when I choose to to take action against it. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1138.68s)]
*  But there's there's a lot of stuff that that we could be fundraising for at any given moment. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1143.32s)]
*  All right. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1149.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1150.2s)]
*  This side is much better. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1150.84s)]
*  This is like they're they're like cute animal. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1151.8799999999999s)]
*  Thank you both for all y'all do on Twitch and your fundraising. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1155.6399999999999s)]
*  I'm also an animal conservationist. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1159.56s)]
*  Cool. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1161.9599999999998s)]
*  So you're a huge inspiration to me. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1162.28s)]
*  I wanted to know if you had any tips about teaching about ever you don't physically have [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1165.32s)]
*  the animals there because I'm a VTuber. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1171.56s)]
*  So I don't really show myself or anything. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1173.8799999999999s)]
*  And I've started doing animal education and my community loves it. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1176.4399999999998s)]
*  But I wanted to feel more interactive. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1179.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1183.4s)]
*  So I guess I think the next best thing is videos. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1183.8000000000002s)]
*  I still think you can use the ambassador concept. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1189.0s)]
*  I still think you could find videos or pictures or something and get your community attached [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1191.4s)]
*  to a specific animal and get them to be more interested in it that way. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1196.1200000000001s)]
*  I don't know enough about VTubing to know if this is like a possibility. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1200.68s)]
*  But I know that some VTubers are like moving through virtual worlds of sorts. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1204.5200000000002s)]
*  Walking through a rainforest or walking through whatever. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1210.04s)]
*  I would love to see a series of a VTuber walking through habitats. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1213.08s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1215.96s)]
*  I got a suggestion. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1216.2s)]
*  Get a VTuber avatar that's like an animal. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1217.4s)]
*  They have those. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1221.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1222.44s)]
*  Do a furry VTuber avatar. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1223.0s)]
*  Like Winnie the moon but VTuber avatar. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1226.04s)]
*  See people like it. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1228.6000000000001s)]
*  Awesome Navi everybody. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1229.56s)]
*  I miss Winnie so much. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1231.72s)]
*  It's fine. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1234.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1235.64s)]
*  My idea was bad. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1235.96s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1236.76s)]
*  Go. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1237.16s)]
*  No. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1237.56s)]
*  I finished my answer. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1238.2s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1240.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1241.1599999999999s)]
*  Good luck. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1241.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1241.8799999999999s)]
*  All right. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1242.44s)]
*  What do we got here? [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1243.0s)]
*  So to start I just want to say I'm a huge fan of you. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1245.0s)]
*  You saw my 10 month subversary is actually today. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1249.96s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1253.8799999999999s)]
*  I think I'm also hitting about a year of tier three Patreon sub on fear and. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1256.04s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1261.8s)]
*  The greatest podcast. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1262.28s)]
*  Much better than I won't even say the word. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1263.6399999999999s)]
*  Wine about it. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1268.36s)]
*  I actually I talked to my a bit about this when I was at her meet and greet. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1269.48s)]
*  But I'm actually here to tour a college where I'm hoping to study something involving government [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1273.48s)]
*  and go into a government job. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1280.12s)]
*  But right now I'm a junior in high school and I'm just wondering how like for young [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1282.9199999999998s)]
*  people who feel like there is no way for them to do anything for the voice to be heard. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1288.68s)]
*  What do you suggest they could do to kind of make a difference in their community? [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1294.76s)]
*  No, I think your I think your voice is very impactful. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1300.52s)]
*  I think your voices do matter. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1303.56s)]
*  We have we have seen that in action as a matter of fact. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1305.48s)]
*  And the example I will use in this situation is the way that the western world has viewed [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1309.64s)]
*  what is going on in my lifetime. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1317.24s)]
*  I've been a outspoken advocate for Palestinian emancipation for the past decade. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1319.24s)]
*  Professionally as a political commentator and before that as well. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1324.36s)]
*  And I saw the dramatic shift in attitude and the recognition that a lot of people had for [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1328.6799999999998s)]
*  the struggles that Palestinians go through on a daily basis. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1336.6s)]
*  And that was especially in the western world. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1340.4399999999998s)]
*  That was largely a direct consequence of people like yourself from your generation. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1343.32s)]
*  Watching and seeing the struggles that Palestinians go through and recognizing their humanity [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1351.64s)]
*  as a direct consequence of seeing it on social media and then taking matters into your own [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1358.52s)]
*  hands and going out and protesting. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1363.48s)]
*  And I think that every voice in this situation matters. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1365.72s)]
*  Every email that you send, every phone call that you make to your politicians matter. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1369.0s)]
*  Ultimately it seems like change doesn't happen overnight. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1376.1200000000001s)]
*  But it absolutely matters what you do. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1380.04s)]
*  So you just keep up that pressure and never let up. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1382.84s)]
*  And beyond that it seems like you're already personally invested in making that change [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1385.56s)]
*  by infiltrating the government and working. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1390.12s)]
*  So I think that you're already doing it. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1396.04s)]
*  So keep up the good work. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1399.24s)]
*  Hello. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1400.36s)]
*  As someone who is very self-aware with my trash and recycling and trying to pick up [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1401.48s)]
*  after yourself. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1408.44s)]
*  How do you not get demoralized when you clean up a place and it immediately seems to fill [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1409.24s)]
*  with trash? [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1414.28s)]
*  Oh, the conservation existential crisis. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1415.24s)]
*  Yes, a tough one. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1418.76s)]
*  Trash cleanups are awesome. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1420.2s)]
*  Thank you for doing that, number one. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1421.4s)]
*  Very, very cool. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1422.76s)]
*  I think that one very specific thing maybe to think about, and I talk about amphibians [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1424.3600000000001s)]
*  a lot on my stream, that they have this semi-permeable skin and they're really sensitive [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1429.8000000000002s)]
*  to pollutants because when there's runoff into waterways it can affect all those individuals. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1433.5600000000002s)]
*  Amphibians. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1438.92s)]
*  So if you're cleaning up trash and it's not there for a few weeks, you are positively [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1439.8000000000002s)]
*  affecting the animals in that area. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1444.3600000000001s)]
*  So that's really important. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1445.96s)]
*  It sucks that it keeps happening. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1447.3200000000002s)]
*  But if you're not doing it, nobody's doing it and then it's going to pile up and become [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1449.64s)]
*  a way bigger issue potentially to the point where it's uninhabitable for the animals in [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1452.44s)]
*  that area. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1457.5600000000002s)]
*  So you just got to keep it up. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1458.2s)]
*  You know, you're putting on a good fight. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1460.1200000000001s)]
*  Thank you for doing that. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1462.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1463.64s)]
*  I'm sorry, I'll stop throwing the trash over there. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1464.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Hassan is the problem. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1467.0800000000002s)]
*  Hassan letters. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1468.28s)]
*  That's my bad. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1469.32s)]
*  All right. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1470.28s)]
*  Hi Hassan. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1470.92s)]
*  My name is Ledcats, or just Cat. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1472.2s)]
*  I'm a half Lebanese variety streamer and a Lebanese American. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1475.32s)]
*  My question, first of all, thank you for everything you've done for Palestine, free Palestine. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1478.92s)]
*  My family is in the southern Lebanon border and I try really hard as a white passing [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1484.84s)]
*  Lebanese American to speak out and to educate as many of my white friends as possible. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1492.1200000000001s)]
*  My question is, how do you deal with, you've raised so much money for, how do you deal [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1501.0s)]
*  with all the hate for raising that much money for such an important cause? [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1506.2s)]
*  Well, that's a tough one because the thing is, I'm a pretty white passing cisgender [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1512.3600000000001s)]
*  heterosexual guy who's six foot four, right? [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1521.0s)]
*  So overall, a lot of the things that normally would directly target other marginalized [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1524.36s)]
*  individuals, if you're a woman, someone can objectify you, someone can diminish you and [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1531.8799999999999s)]
*  depersonalize, dehumanize you by being a misogynist and that kind of attitude is super normalized. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1538.12s)]
*  The one aspect of my personality that I withstand direct attacks against is obviously [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1544.92s)]
*  being a Muslim and being Turkish. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1552.1200000000001s)]
*  And I guess there's not really anything you can do. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1555.5600000000002s)]
*  It sucks. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1560.52s)]
*  I don't know how else to go about it other than hope that your message reaches people [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1561.16s)]
*  and that it changes their minds and they see you as a person and not operating in this [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1568.92s)]
*  monolithic fashion because you have some cynical approach to the subject matter because you're [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1575.16s)]
*  personally biased and that your bias is somehow sinister and it's not that you're biased to see [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1580.1200000000001s)]
*  the humanity in people that are your family members, people living in Lebanon, people who [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1586.44s)]
*  are victims of Western imperialism. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1592.1200000000001s)]
*  And you know, it's just we're living in a post 9-11 war on terror world and I think a lot of people [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1594.8400000000001s)]
*  who are from that part of the world who are Muslim or even Christian, who are Arab, definitely [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1603.0800000000002s)]
*  realize that like for a lot of Americans that was a real comfortable skin to wear. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1611.56s)]
*  Like they flip that on like that. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1616.1200000000001s)]
*  When I saw Dr. Oz get almost elected as a Republican in Pennsylvania, I was like, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1619.16s)]
*  damn, like he's a Sunni Muslim. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1625.0s)]
*  Like he's running against a dude that is awful and I'm not going to get into that. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1626.76s)]
*  But like I was like, that's a Muslim guy running on the Republican ticket. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1632.6s)]
*  Like I thought this was the war on terror country and I thought things were changing. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1635.96s)]
*  It turns out obviously post-doctor 7, I was wrong. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1641.3999999999999s)]
*  People were waiting for the opportunity. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1644.28s)]
*  But the reality of the matter is you just, I guess, never show weakness and never give [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1646.68s)]
*  people the pleasure of feeling like they got you, that they made you feel a certain way [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1654.28s)]
*  by so easily and in such an awful way, such a cynical way, just make you feel less of [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1660.52s)]
*  a human being, less than a human being. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1668.1200000000001s)]
*  Because it's that easy for people. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1671.16s)]
*  And everyone in this room knows this from one point or another. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1672.68s)]
*  Like if you're a black person, you know exactly what I'm talking about. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1676.8400000000001s)]
*  Where, you know, if you're a woman, you know exactly what I'm talking about. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1680.3600000000001s)]
*  If you're a trans person, you know exactly what I'm talking about. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1682.8400000000001s)]
*  It just, all it takes is like one word to rob you of your humanity. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1685.24s)]
*  And people are so callous in their indifference to that. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1691.24s)]
*  And so easily they weaponize that against you in an effort to basically own you [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1695.5600000000002s)]
*  in that immediate moment. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1702.44s)]
*  So just don't give in and try to take on the emotional labor personally, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1705.0s)]
*  to the best of your ability, and keep as cool of a face as you possibly can. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1711.88s)]
*  That's what really motivates me, honestly. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1718.6000000000001s)]
*  Sorry for filibustering the conversation. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1720.8400000000001s)]
*  But that's what really motivates me is that I always think about like the sweaty little [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1723.48s)]
*  edgelord on the other side of the computer who's like pathetic and hates their life. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1730.44s)]
*  And I don't want to give them even an ounce of gratification. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1735.4s)]
*  So, you know, that's, I do get motivated by spite in that regard when, [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1739.48s)]
*  in moments like that. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1744.76s)]
*  So you can carry that on as a lesson, I hope. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1745.72s)]
*  I'm with you in the spite thing, 100%. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1749.16s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1752.1200000000001s)]
*  All right, thank you. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1753.0800000000002s)]
*  I don't know how Asana does it, honestly. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1754.04s)]
*  That was some golden advice. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1756.76s)]
*  It's good advice. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1758.8400000000001s)]
*  Hi, I'm Aiden. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1759.8799999999999s)]
*  So I'm going into my last year, a wildlife and conservation degree. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1761.48s)]
*  And I'm kind of like, where do I go from there? [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1766.76s)]
*  Especially as someone who's disabled and trans, it's like, [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1770.36s)]
*  I've done a lot of volunteer work. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1775.1599999999999s)]
*  But how do I switch that to something that's a bit more accessible, [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1777.8799999999999s)]
*  but still involves animals? [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1781.72s)]
*  Okay. Okay. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1783.3999999999999s)]
*  So I have a lot of different kinds of advice, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1784.52s)]
*  depending on what kinds of things you're looking at doing. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1786.9199999999998s)]
*  One of the pieces of advice I get all the time that you guys have probably heard [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1789.8s)]
*  is if you want to work with big cats, if you want to work with tigers or something, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1794.36s)]
*  you have to start by volunteering at a cat shelter, like a dog and cat shelter. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1799.8s)]
*  Any animal care experience is good animal care experience. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1803.3999999999999s)]
*  So the volunteering is an excellent start. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1807.32s)]
*  Generally, people will go volunteering and then they'll get an internship [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1809.8799999999999s)]
*  and then become staff somewhere. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1813.0s)]
*  So internships is probably the next thing I would look at. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1815.08s)]
*  If you're not able to do the physical labor, there's a lot of needs [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1818.2s)]
*  as someone who runs a nonprofit, animal care nonprofits that are not animal care. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1823.0800000000002s)]
*  So there's administrative work, there's marketing work. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1827.8s)]
*  We need artists. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1830.6000000000001s)]
*  I pay artists to make flyers and stuff like that. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1831.64s)]
*  There's educational curation. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1835.32s)]
*  I have people that help me with research that curate educational programs. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1838.1200000000001s)]
*  So that's something that you can do from a computer at home that directly benefits animals. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1843.0s)]
*  There's tons of jobs that you can do that aren't scooping shit. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1847.4s)]
*  Yeah, because I have about 10 years of volunteer experience with the wild animals. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1852.1200000000001s)]
*  I especially like birds. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1857.64s)]
*  So it's like trying to figure out where I want to be able to do hands-on stuff, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1859.16s)]
*  but still not get hurt basically. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1864.92s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1867.64s)]
*  Yeah, find somewhere that has internships and see what the job description is of those internships. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1868.52s)]
*  It also depends on the types of animals you're working with. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1873.16s)]
*  Maybe some smaller birds, songbirds would make more sense than eagles and stuff like that, [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1876.1999999999998s)]
*  but you'll find your way. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1881.2399999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1882.9199999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1883.6399999999999s)]
*  All right, next question. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1884.36s)]
*  Hello, I'm a big fan of song, even bigger fan of Kaya. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1885.8s)]
*  Because of you, I'm active in protests and fundraisers online. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1890.04s)]
*  And because of that, I've run into a lot of people who are just curious if you know what I mean. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1897.2399999999998s)]
*  Oh, I know what you mean. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1903.56s)]
*  And I'm wondering, how do you change your battles? [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1905.0800000000002s)]
*  How do you determine when it's best to try to educate someone versus ignoring them? [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1907.88s)]
*  I'm a really stubborn piece, as you guys know. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1912.2s)]
*  So I will, no matter what, if someone is coming in to be like, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1915.24s)]
*  why are you the worst person and also an Islamist fundamentalist? [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1919.72s)]
*  Just curious. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1923.0800000000002s)]
*  Even if they say that, I'm going to approach that. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1923.96s)]
*  Because I don't want to ever squander an educational opportunity, [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1927.0800000000002s)]
*  given that it's not directly about that person who's asking that question. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1930.44s)]
*  But it's also all of the people that are just tuning in in that situation. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1934.76s)]
*  But in a one-on-one conversation, is that what you're asking about? [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1938.52s)]
*  Like a one-on-one conversation? [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1941.5600000000002s)]
*  Well, that's a little different, I think. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1944.52s)]
*  You have to read the situation and then see for yourself if this person is truly hostile, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1946.6000000000001s)]
*  wants to genuinely hear your perspective, or if they are just shooting. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1953.24s)]
*  And if they're doing that, then yeah. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1958.2s)]
*  Like, in the real world, I think, in many instances, it's a lot more difficult to like... [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1960.92s)]
*  In some ways, it's a lot easier to change someone's mind if they're not coming in as a hostile entity. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1968.76s)]
*  But if they're just simply there to debate you and just demoralize you and exhaust you, [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1974.3600000000001s)]
*  then there's no reason to take on that task at all. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1980.3600000000001s)]
*  So I guess it's totally situational. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1985.72s)]
*  It's totally dependent on the other party. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1991.4s)]
*  And you've got to make that read on your own. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1995.88s)]
*  But always be charitable. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1998.1200000000001s)]
*  Like, always assume that the other person is charitable. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=1999.3200000000002s)]
*  I think that's the best practice. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2001.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2004.04s)]
*  Well, hello. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2004.68s)]
*  Hello. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2005.4s)]
*  So, Maya, you've done a ton of different types of fundraising, like, you know, the guests and stuff. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2005.88s)]
*  What's your favorite to do? [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2012.1200000000001s)]
*  Which one do you have the most fun doing? [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2014.1200000000001s)]
*  Who's your favorite guest that you've ever had on Elvius? [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2015.8s)]
*  My favorite collaborator, person who's come to Elvius. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2018.76s)]
*  Are you wanting me to say you? [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2023.96s)]
*  I mean... [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2026.1200000000001s)]
*  Hassan's community did raise $30,000 for Elvius. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2027.48s)]
*  Well, they did. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2032.3600000000001s)]
*  So he gets points for that. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2033.32s)]
*  I liked Ray. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2035.08s)]
*  She was excellent. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2037.0s)]
*  She was not afraid of anything. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2037.96s)]
*  She was really nice to all the animals. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2039.72s)]
*  They all loved her. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2041.0s)]
*  They loved me too, okay? [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2041.96s)]
*  Everyone was fine with Hassan except for the chinchillas. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2044.36s)]
*  Anyone stop touching them? [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2046.84s)]
*  You're just jealous that Winnie and I clicked. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2048.04s)]
*  What was my favorite fundraiser? [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2049.96s)]
*  So, we do a lot at Elvius. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2051.72s)]
*  We do them annually. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2054.6s)]
*  I think my favorite one that we do is probably our art auction. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2055.72s)]
*  So our animals learn how to paint voluntarily and in lots of different ways. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2059.48s)]
*  Some of them actually hold sponges and paint brushes and some of them just wiggle over a campus kind of thing. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2064.36s)]
*  But the paintings are always wonderful and we auction them off every year. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2071.8799999999997s)]
*  That one's probably my favorite because then the people that are buying them get like a piece of the sanctuary and something really special. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2075.64s)]
*  And it's something that all of our animal care staff who's here today gets to participate in too. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2081.72s)]
*  So it's a really special one. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2086.8399999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2088.2799999999997s)]
*  Alright. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2089.96s)]
*  I think by the way, sorry, do we have five minutes? [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2092.2s)]
*  Five minutes. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2096.3599999999997s)]
*  Okay, so we're going to take one more question from each side, I think. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2097.08s)]
*  Alright, we'll be concise. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2100.76s)]
*  Both of us. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2102.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2103.64s)]
*  My special cause that's close to my heart is colon cancer research. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2107.56s)]
*  And after my dad passed away from it and whenever I was researching different places to donate to, [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2111.96s)]
*  it felt confusing. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2119.96s)]
*  Like there were so many options and I didn't know who was legit, who wasn't. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2121.32s)]
*  And that happened with Palestine as well. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2125.4s)]
*  I didn't know who was legit for sure. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2127.7999999999997s)]
*  So I was wondering what you guys' experiences were for that. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2131.0s)]
*  Do you have a team that screens that or do you personally get into screening it? [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2134.68s)]
*  I personally get into screening it. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2139.08s)]
*  But you're absolutely correct. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2141.32s)]
*  There are a lot of charities out there that are, especially when it comes to, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2142.7599999999998s)]
*  there are a lot of charities beyond the normal 501c3 operations that are already kind of shady to begin with. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2147.7999999999997s)]
*  But with foreign, with issues that are in areas that America has purposefully shut off normal payment processes from, [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2156.52s)]
*  it becomes a really tricky situation. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2167.4s)]
*  But I obviously have a network of activists that I rely on that I can talk to specifically in moments like this. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2169.4s)]
*  And not only advocates but like family members that know exactly which charities are directly working on the ground despite the limitations. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2177.48s)]
*  So it does require a lot of research ahead of time before investing all this time and energy into it. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2191.48s)]
*  But I think it's very valuable and you're on the right track when you're thinking about it like that. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2198.76s)]
*  Now in terms of colon cancer, I would assume that the issues that you run into are the regular 501c3 problems. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2203.72s)]
*  People probably know this or I don't know, I mean the most famous case of this is the Red Crescent, right? [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2213.64s)]
*  Like millions of dollars are donated by individuals who think they're doing the right thing and they are doing the right thing in that moment. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2218.52s)]
*  And then Red Crescent takes that and squanders it and basically utilizes 99% of those funds to, I don't know, pay off like executives or whatever. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2225.4s)]
*  And I think that that's truly horrific. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2236.12s)]
*  So it definitely requires a little bit of research ahead of time before making any sort of like time commitment or any sort of additional commitments in terms of fundraising. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2238.12s)]
*  But it's always good. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2249.2400000000002s)]
*  Sorry, totally in our heads. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2251.2400000000002s)]
*  Non-profits also have their financial reports available online or their 990s and you can look through those if you want to do that research. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2253.3199999999997s)]
*  If you go on their website, it'll be on there if it's a legitimate non-profit. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2259.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2263.3199999999997s)]
*  Okay, last one really quick or are we done? [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2265.3199999999997s)]
*  No, no, let's get one from your... [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2267.3199999999997s)]
*  One more. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2269.3199999999997s)]
*  You guys, first of all, lots of respect to both of you for all the work that you do to make a better world, right? [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2271.3199999999997s)]
*  My question is just how do you see vegan lifestyle plant-based eating fitting into that? [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2277.4s)]
*  Because it's something that we can all participate in. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2283.4s)]
*  Dude, you are brawling. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2285.4s)]
*  Are you vegan? [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2287.4s)]
*  You're vegan? [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2289.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2291.4s)]
*  God damn. This dude is just eating so much pea protein, bro. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2293.4s)]
*  That tastes so bad, sorry. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2295.4s)]
*  Oh, also, can I... [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2297.4s)]
*  I want to cut in real quick, sorry. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2299.4s)]
*  I said Red Crescent, I was talking about Red Cross. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2301.4s)]
*  I apologize. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2303.4s)]
*  I was talking about a charity fraud. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2305.48s)]
*  But go ahead, sorry. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2307.48s)]
*  I just mean, how do you guys feel in regards to that? [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2309.48s)]
*  Obviously, there's lots of ways to promote it. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2313.48s)]
*  Bro, you're walking billboard. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2315.48s)]
*  What do you mean, lots of ways to promote it? [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2317.48s)]
*  How much do you weigh? [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2319.48s)]
*  Don't ask how much he weighs. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2321.48s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2323.48s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2325.48s)]
*  Look at him. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2327.48s)]
*  We can talk after if you want. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2329.48s)]
*  He's FDA approved steak over here. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2331.48s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2333.56s)]
*  I think veganism is great. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2335.56s)]
*  I think it's great both in regards to animal welfare. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2337.56s)]
*  Because obviously, it is the absolute best [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2339.56s)]
*  that you can do for animal welfare. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2341.56s)]
*  And it's great environmentally, generally speaking too. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2343.56s)]
*  So if that's something that you guys are able to participate in, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2345.56s)]
*  even if it's not black and white, I'm vegan now. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2349.56s)]
*  Even if it's trying vegan meals every once in a while, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2351.56s)]
*  and that doesn't have to be like a fake meat product [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2353.56s)]
*  or like a packaged, this is a vegan thing. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2357.56s)]
*  There are lots of things that you can do to have a vegan diet [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2359.56s)]
*  that are not that crazy. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2361.64s)]
*  You can do a lot of beans, you can do a lot of quinoa, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2363.64s)]
*  and lentils and stuff like that. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2365.64s)]
*  And just try it out. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2367.64s)]
*  There's tons of recipes online. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2369.64s)]
*  And I think it's something that a lot of more people [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2371.64s)]
*  need to give a try. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2373.64s)]
*  But I think it's also, I understand that it can be tough [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2375.64s)]
*  to make that full switch, both in terms of lifestyle [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2377.64s)]
*  and financially sometimes and all that. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2379.64s)]
*  But give it a try. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2381.64s)]
*  Thanks for your question. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2383.64s)]
*  I just want to get some input and get that out there. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2385.64s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2387.64s)]

*  but you know, [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2421.7999999999997s)]

*  go out there [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2425.7999999999997s)]
*  and put these words into action. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2427.7999999999997s)]
*  And that's how change happens. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2429.7999999999997s)]
*  So never forget that. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2431.7999999999997s)]
*  You all play a very important role, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6OGwIGheg&t=2433.7999999999997s)]
