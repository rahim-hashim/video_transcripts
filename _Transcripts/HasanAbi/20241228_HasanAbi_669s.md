# Bringing Hope To The Homeless | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [December 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y)
*  especially at a time when homelessness has grown by 18% in the last year, and that homes people are [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=0.0s)]
*  increasingly under attack all over the country. The secondary goal here is to try to get others [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=8.48s)]
*  to also join in and do their own charitable contributions. You know, lead the way by doing [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=15.92s)]
*  good things. Meta-von-net. Oh, also. Yeah. I balled my freaking face off folks. Big day today. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=22.56s)]
*  Also, I just wanted to show you guys this. I am, I was a little late this morning when I, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=34.0s)]
*  when I came live, when I went live, part of that is because I was actually clearing like parts of [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=40.64s)]
*  my closet, final round brewing. Thank you for the five, give the subs. I was clearing out my closet [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=46.72s)]
*  because I have like thousands and thousands of jackets and hoodies and sweatshirts and numerous [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=53.52s)]
*  articles of clothing that have been gifted to me. And I was like, I want to LA thrift stores about [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=64.56s)]
*  to be lit. No, I'm going to give it directly. I am going to give it directly to people of skid row [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=70.8s)]
*  who, you know, probably needed a lot more than random fashionistas who want to random fashionistas [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=77.75999999999999s)]
*  who want drip in a sea of drown. But there are a lot like they're all clean. They're all washed or, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=87.28s)]
*  you know, never worn basically. And that's what we're doing. This wouldn't have been such an [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=95.92s)]
*  issue. If you didn't tack the extra stuff at the end about how you were ultimately right about the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=100.64s)]
*  Amber heard trial, people clipped you out of context. And then the next bread that you say [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=103.6s)]
*  was mutual abuse. You learn nothing and make things worse because you do have a misogyny [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=106.08s)]
*  blind spot. An apology would be way more appropriate than double down. Let it go, let it go, bro, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=108.88s)]
*  please. Or lady, let it go, let it go, let it go. Stop hanging on, stop hanging on to it. Stop, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=114.64s)]
*  please. I beg you. That's awesome. You're going to help the homeless directly. Just be a bit careful. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=120.56s)]
*  Wait, what? Oh, we're working with, we're working with a, you know, local organization, obviously. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=124.48s)]
*  We're working with a local organization. I'm over here talking about like helping out on [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=136.24s)]
*  house people is skid row. Cause I like, I don't like the way you covered the Amber heard trial. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=141.6s)]
*  Like shut the up, lock in. God damn. You're so one note, dude. Anyway, as far as that chatter [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=147.04s)]
*  saying, be careful. I don't think that chatter meant be careful because homeless people are [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=156.39999999999998s)]
*  violent. I think that chatter might be careful with like how you film, okay. How you film this, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=160.0s)]
*  this, this process, because obviously, obviously like I, there is like, it's not going to be [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=166.23999999999998s)]
*  exploitative. That's something that I am like very worried about and very aware of. And, and so [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=172.8s)]
*  that's what I'm going to be very cognizant of. And in hopefully it won't be, you know, I mean, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=180.08s)]
*  not even hopefully we're, we're going there with a, with some people that work every single day [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=187.68s)]
*  with these people. So it's not, don't film it. Maybe up, up, up, up. You're the woke of the day. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=194.56s)]
*  Isn't it inherently exploitative to film? No, you the entire point is humanizing these people. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=202.08s)]
*  That's the whole point. Can you just shut the up, please? Can all of you just collectively shut your [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  stupid woke mouths up? Is that okay? Can we just shut up collectively? Sounds like a write off. I [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=215.28s)]
*  am going to Brian me. I absolutely despise the insanely cynical nature of everyone online. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=223.36s)]
*  Okay. Insanely cynical nature of every single person online where they just automatically assume [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=234.88000000000002s)]
*  the worst of every other person. You are just demonstrating that you're a bad person. Okay. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=242.56s)]
*  That's all you're doing. You're like, I'm a bad person and I would only do such a thing if there's [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=247.76000000000002s)]
*  additional financial gain for me. It's not the case. Okay. I'm very aware of how these things [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=252.4s)]
*  look. I'm very aware of what I'm doing. It's not a Mr. Beast segment. Okay. Didn't you just say you [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=260.08s)]
*  wish people were more cynical? No, not in this regard. I wish people would be more cynical or [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=265.36s)]
*  more realistic about structural violence and systems that oppress people that they exist under [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=270.96s)]
*  instead of being cynical about a [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=277.76s)]
*  all of you. I'd be, I'll be honest. I'm going to keep doing what I'm doing, but I despise some [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=286.8s)]
*  of you. All right. The entire purpose of this project is not only to deliver needs, deliver [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=290.96000000000004s)]
*  goods that are much needed by on house people, but it's also being done in a way that is the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=300.08s)]
*  most ethical, least exploitative way possible where it's all done with prior consent with [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=307.52s)]
*  local organizers that already work with these guys on a daily basis. And the entire point of this is [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=313.59999999999997s)]
*  to develop a better understanding of the humanity of on house people who are just like you. Okay. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=320.15999999999997s)]
*  That is the whole point, especially at a time when homelessness has grown by 18% in the last year [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=328.24s)]
*  and that homes people are, are, are increasingly under attack all over the country. The secondary [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=336.08s)]
*  goal here is to try to get others to also join in and do their own charitable contributions. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=343.12s)]
*  You know, lead the way by doing good things. Medabane. This chat has stolen 10 years of your [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=350.88s)]
*  life due to the stupid. They say, I know, I know. I know. Vegans are so annoying about zoos was [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=355.36s)]
*  using a necessary part of wildlife conservation. Yeah. As a former on house person, may I say, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=364.64s)]
*  I love you. Love you too. Chatter. If it's so ethical, could you do it every day? Okay, dude, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=369.76s)]
*  listen, listen to me. Okay. I'm just asking if it's so ethical, couldn't you do it every day? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=374.48s)]
*  Okay. Listen, your own experience in the holiday season away from your friends and [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=379.44s)]
*  family does not mean you can come in here and just like try to ruin everyone else's experience. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=385.12s)]
*  Do you understand? Please stop. Like all of this is unimaginably selfish. And I hope everyone [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=389.68s)]
*  understands that you're not being woke. You're not the most woke in here. All you're doing is [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=395.92s)]
*  just like demonstrating your own personal f**king mania, your own personal narcissistic desires [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=400.08s)]
*  of trying to reframe the conversation away from everything else to you being the center of [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=406.72s)]
*  attention masquerading with emancipatory language, hiding your true purpose of [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=412.08s)]
*  narcissistic me, me, me. I'm the center of attention desires by utilizing emancipatory [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=418.24s)]
*  language does not change that reality. Okay. We're not doing that. We're not doing that in [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=423.12s)]
*  2014 or 2024. We're not doing that in 2025. We've never done it in this f**king community. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=428.32s)]
*  And the reason why we're here right now and the reason why people are being extra annoying [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=434.0s)]
*  is because of a multitude of different factors. Number one, it is holiday season. So a lot of the [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=437.92s)]
*  people that tune in at this time are kind of feeling the pressure of holiday season. The [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=442.64000000000004s)]
*  weather is s**t. Maybe you didn't see your family. Maybe you had a bad experience with your family [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=447.2s)]
*  and now you're f**king angry. It's holiday season. Now you're drinking. I see it all the time. I've [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=451.84000000000003s)]
*  been doing this for what? Six years on this goddamn platform. I see it every holiday season. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=456.24s)]
*  I still go live regardless because I still want to maintain a sense of community and be there for a [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=461.36s)]
*  lot of people who feel alone in this time. Okay. But that doesn't mean you can be f**king annoying [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=466.56s)]
*  about it. All right. I'm not your goddamn like this community is not your f**king projecting [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=472.96s)]
*  onto us. Yes, dude. I'm so lonely in this holiday season. My mom just walked in. Listen, I have to [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=478.64s)]
*  blast off. Okay. No more woke up. Please. Really annoying. All right. Let's blast off light news [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=485.44s)]
*  to deliver much needed goods to unhoused people. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=494.24s)]
*  Oh my God. My dad's like, I want to go through the pile because I want to take some to Turkey [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=506.16s)]
*  to give to the, the, the those in need in Turkey. I'm like, dude, just go upstairs. There's more [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=510.72s)]
*  clothes upstairs. Please. F**kers never let a good D go unpunished. All right. Light news. Then lol [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=516.08s)]
*  overall, I take it to the streets to deliver much needed goods to unhoused people that interviewed [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=520.96s)]
*  them alongside local organizers. Get in now. All right. Do we have a, do we have a blast off meme [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=523.76s)]
*  or not? God, I'm so tired. My son's dad used to live once get rolling on for two years. He's seven [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=531.6800000000001s)]
*  months sober. So many good people helped him while he was out there. Jacks will be helpful for the [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=536.88s)]
*  community. Please cover this. I posted it twice. Okay, dude. I will say I was fired the Friday [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=540.32s)]
*  before Christmas. And despite all the bad things happening to me in the stress, you and this [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=545.9200000000001s)]
*  community have been really solid cushion for me emotionally. Exactly. That's why I go live during [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=548.64s)]
*  the holidays. Anyway, part of the reason why are there writers in this stream? I will one, that's [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=552.48s)]
*  not a bad thing. It's a good thing. We want there to be right wingers in the stream. We want to [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=559.4399999999999s)]
*  change their minds. I haven't done the new year's resolutions yet, but I will eventually. Do we have [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=563.68s)]
*  a blast off meme or not? Do we not? We don't have a blast off meme. I think you ever going to continue [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=568.08s)]
*  elder ring. No, I'm never going to play elder ring ever again for the rest of my life. I'm never [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=572.56s)]
*  going to play another video game for the rest of my life. Oh God, I'm in such a bad move. I think [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=575.84s)]
*  I'm going to have to, I think I'm going to have to, to take some time off noticing that I'm getting, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=579.52s)]
*  I have a much shorter fuse. My dad called me at Christmas and it kind of ruined my day. But your [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=585.2800000000001s)]
*  Christmas stream made me feel better. Mr. Shimmer. Your dad called you a slur. That's insane. Anyway, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=590.72s)]
*  here it is. We're blasting off. Let's go. Let's get the people going. Let's fucking get it started. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=596.24s)]
*  Let's get it. Don't get it twisted. Japan will heal you. We'll see. Because honestly, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=600.72s)]
*  the other side of the story, especially with respect to Japan is that I am worried that I'm [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=606.0s)]
*  woefully underprepared. I did get like a sick, I got the sick backpack, the new backpack, the one [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=612.0s)]
*  that Nick has, and we're going to get all the bells and whistles ready to go. I'm going to probably [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=617.36s)]
*  fire off a, another IRL stream before I leave for Japan. Don't let the randoms in chat bother you. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=622.32s)]
*  You've given really good context through the content, through the holidays. And I love listening [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=630.72s)]
*  to your coverage while I'm exercising. Thank you for your great 2024. If you do go to Japan, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=633.9200000000001s)]
*  make it a true vacation and stream less, got to rest. No. As a Scottish person, it seems crazy in [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=638.1600000000001s)]
*  here who have chatters that haven't called them a slur. I'm ESL. What's the difference between [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=642.4000000000001s)]
*  homeless and unhoused? Is there one word that's better to use? I mean, I don't want to say homeless [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=647.36s)]
*  when straight up talking to homeless people, you know what I mean? It's a more humanizing language [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=651.5999999999999s)]
*  to use when you say unhoused. I mean, but if you get triggered by that, you're a fucking goon, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=656.4s)]
*  you know, you're a goober. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6Fj-cUi1Y&t=662.24s)]
