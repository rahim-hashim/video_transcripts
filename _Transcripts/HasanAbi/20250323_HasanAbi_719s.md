# They Voted For Trump. Here’s Why They Feel Betrayed | Hasanabi Reacts to More Perfect Union
**HasanAbi:** [March 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A)
*  Hey rock and a hard place. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=0.0s)]
*  Bro. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=1.2s)]
*  The craziest thing is being like Chicano being a Latino person in America and [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=1.44s)]
*  voting for Trump because like half of the conversation is about how you're the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  enemy. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=12.34s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  Like half the combo. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=15.52s)]
*  It's not like Trump was hiding it. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=17.32s)]
*  He just straight up was like, yeah, they're all bro. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=19.1s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=26.68s)]
*  Let's get back to the hogs who are upset about voting for Donald Trump. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=27.08s)]
*  They voted for Trump. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=34.6s)]
*  They feel betrayed. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=35.32s)]
*  I'm going to do a hogwash, but I got to pee first. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=36.2s)]
*  Twenty thousand dollars a month without insurance. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=37.76s)]
*  I make eight hundred dollars a month. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=40.28s)]
*  Oh, that will kill you. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=41.92s)]
*  That would be my friends. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=42.8s)]
*  With millions of people in this country, they lose their health care. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=45.36s)]
*  We're in California's District 22, a rural community in the state's Central [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=49.4s)]
*  Valley. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=53.56s)]
*  This district voted for Trump for the first time in 2024, but now his policies [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=54.559999999999995s)]
*  threaten one of the benefits people here rely on the most. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=59.32s)]
*  It bothers me when people like Elon Musk say that people on those programs are [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=62.96s)]
*  the parasite class. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=69.24s)]
*  It's just cruel. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=71.2s)]
*  Do you know anyone personally who voted for President Trump but depends on [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=72.52s)]
*  benefits like Medicaid? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=77.84s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=80.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=80.84s)]
*  I know a lot of people. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=81.36s)]
*  Trump promised a lot of things. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  I thought it would be more family values and those programs that really [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  do what they need here. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=90.76s)]
*  One of those promises was to protect Medicaid, which 67 percent of people in [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=92.28s)]
*  this district rely on. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=97.12s)]
*  It's the largest percentage of any district in the entire country. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  Can you guarantee that Medicare and Medicaid will not be touched? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=102.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I have said it so many times, we're not going to touch it. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  But his administration just proposed an eight hundred and eighty billion dollar [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=109.75999999999999s)]
*  cut to Medicaid over the next 10 years. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=113.52s)]
*  So we wanted to come here to find out how people are feeling about Trump and his [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=115.8s)]
*  administration's decision that could have a huge impact on one of the benefits [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=119.88s)]
*  they rely on the most. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=123.88s)]
*  One resident who would be impacted by Medicaid cuts is 64-year-old Irma [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=128.48s)]
*  Arradondo, who voted for Trump in 2024. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=133.28s)]
*  Irma has several chronic health issues, including type one diabetes. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=136.68s)]
*  She's also a full time caregiver for her daughter who has cerebral palsy and her [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=141.2s)]
*  sister who has Turner syndrome. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  Valerie has her medication for her seizures. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=148.56s)]
*  She needs to care for everything. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=151.32s)]
*  I just give a massage to her hands, her legs. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=153.68s)]
*  I stay with her until she falls asleep. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=157.84s)]
*  Sounds like you take really good care of her. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=160.51999999999998s)]
*  Oh, and my baby is my dog. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=162.72s)]
*  So you, your sister Irene and your daughter Valerie, you're all on Medicaid. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=165.64s)]
*  And how important is Medicaid for your family? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=173.2s)]
*  Can you imagine? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=179.07999999999998s)]
*  We live in the daily basis with sicknesses. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=180.67999999999998s)]
*  This is for the cholesterol too. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=186.2s)]
*  This is also for my blood pressure. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=190.64s)]
*  So Medicaid pays for all of it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=193.12s)]
*  If you didn't have Medicaid, how much would this cost you? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=195.76s)]
*  How much money? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=199.0s)]
*  Thousands maybe. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=200.48s)]
*  Thousands. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=202.84s)]
*  And that's just for you? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=204.0s)]
*  Not for your daughter? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=206.0s)]
*  Not for your sister? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=207.68s)]
*  No. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=208.72s)]
*  The medicine that my daughter takes for seizures. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=209.12s)]
*  Republicans are the most successful con artists. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=212.6s)]
*  How the f**k do you convince this girl to vote for Trump? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=214.68s)]
*  People don't have any hope. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=216.95999999999998s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=219.0s)]
*  It's just like, when I watch stuff like this, I'm just reminded of the failure of [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=220.04s)]
*  the Democrats. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=224.44s)]
*  Once again, I know people will say, Hassan, you just sh** on the Democrats all the time. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=225.07999999999998s)]
*  But like, like the Democrats lost these people to Trump. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=228.23999999999998s)]
*  It's important to try and understand the severity of their failure. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=232.83999999999997s)]
*  Won't be able to afford it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=238.39999999999998s)]
*  So we, we feel hopeless if those cuts come. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=241.04s)]
*  You know? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=244.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=245.68s)]
*  Irma was a farm worker for more than a decade. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=246.96s)]
*  She believes that some of her and her children's health issues can be linked to [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=249.6s)]
*  the pesticides she was exposed to while working in the fields. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=253.44s)]
*  When I was pregnant with my child, I was working in the field. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=257.36s)]
*  I remember it was this little airplane and sprayed us. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=260.32s)]
*  But when my baby was born, the doctor just said, oh, something's missing. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=266.84000000000003s)]
*  And he went, he gave me my baby. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=272.68s)]
*  My baby doesn't have her arm. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=274.28000000000003s)]
*  So with these risks that you and your community face in agriculture, and then, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=277.76s)]
*  and then to have the system threatened to take away your health insurance, to [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=285.04s)]
*  take away protection, how does it make you feel? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=290.92s)]
*  Like I told you, I feel like this toughness in the back, you know? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=296.04s)]
*  But why? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=300.92s)]
*  Why when we put food on their tables? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=302.04s)]
*  You know, that we risk our health. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=304.76000000000005s)]
*  Look at me right now. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=307.20000000000005s)]
*  Look at me, how many sicknesses that I have. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=309.0s)]
*  The COPD, I didn't have COPD at that time. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=311.64000000000004s)]
*  We got all in the fields. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=314.84000000000003s)]
*  Where else? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=316.92s)]
*  We're seeking permanent income tax cuts all across the board. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=318.44s)]
*  The $880 billion in Medicaid cuts proposed in President Trump's budget will help pay [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=322.56s)]
*  to permanently extend his 2017 tax cuts. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=328.48s)]
*  The largest tax breaks would go to the wealthiest individuals. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=332.64000000000004s)]
*  Are those your values? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=337.36s)]
*  No, that's not right. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=338.92s)]
*  In the last election, who did you vote for? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=351.28000000000003s)]
*  I feel embarrassed to tell you. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=354.96s)]
*  Bro, I would never, just don't admit it. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=357.47999999999996s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=360.15999999999997s)]
*  Like I just, you're suffering enough. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=361.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=364.2s)]
*  I just, I just wouldn't, I just would not embarrass, I would not admit it. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=365.03999999999996s)]
*  You know? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=369.68s)]
*  Just don't say it. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=371.28s)]
*  Don't say it. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=372.35999999999996s)]
*  That before years, all the years back, since I got my citizenship, I, I said I was a [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=373.44s)]
*  Democrat, but then, and these last elections, I voted for the Republican. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=381.6s)]
*  Why? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=390.2s)]
*  Because I'm against abortion. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=391.64s)]
*  Family values. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=402.48s)]
*  Irma isn't the only one in District 22 who feels betrayed by the administration's [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=405.48s)]
*  The only people they're hurting are those poor people. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=411.6s)]
*  People that are, that really need the stuff. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=414.24s)]
*  Elon Musk doesn't need it. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=417.28000000000003s)]
*  Trump doesn't need it. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=419.32s)]
*  And, you know, billionaires don't need it. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=421.12s)]
*  They're making out big time with this, but they're hurting people in the process. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=423.84000000000003s)]
*  District 22's representative is David Valadeo, a Republican who voted in favor of the [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=428.52s)]
*  budget resolution to cut Medicaid after initially voicing concerns about how potential [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMfWAFqba8A&t=433.88s)]
