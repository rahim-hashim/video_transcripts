# Trump Defends Comments About Liz Cheney | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [November 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA)
*  In terms of in terms of Lishaney, he's right. I'm actually going to point out once again, how bad Trump has been in comparison to 2016. Because the moment that Kamala Harris was like, Oh, Lishaney is my goat. He should have been saying this. He should have been like, nonstop at every rally. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=0.0s)]
*  2016 the leaders and heroes of the Republican Party were the Bush and Cheney families. And is it weird for you to see the lag kind of making it hard to watch? What lag brother? See Liz Cheney, that'd be Dick Cheney's repulsive little daughter running against you with Kamala Harris. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=20.08s)]
*  Well, I think it hurts Kamala a lot. Actually, look, she's a deranged person. The reason she doesn't like me is that she wanted to stay in Iraq. She wanted to stay. She wants to, you know, tough, tough person. You know, people get all up. She's real tough, right? They're not the tough people. Don't forget, I went against her and in her state, which is a great, beautiful state, she lost for Congress with the highest number in history. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=47.48s)]
*  There has never been a congressperson that lost by almost 40 points. And the reason is because if they were ever in that situation, they quit and she lost. She was beaten by a tremendous person, actually tremendous that I backed fully. But the reason she couldn't say me is that she always wanted to go to with people. I don't want to go to her. She wanted to go. She wanted to stay in Syria. I took him out. She wanted to stay in Iraq. I took him out. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=77.48s)]
*  I mean, if we're up to her, we'd we'd be in 50 different countries. And, you know, number one, it's very dangerous. Number two, a lot of people get killed. And number three, I mean, it's very, very expensive. That's why we owe $36 trillion. We go, you know, it used to be you go to the victor belong the spoils, right? In other words, if you beat a country, you own that country, you take the oil, you. We go to war. We come the crap out of it. Then we leave. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=106.0s)]
*  You know, it's almost like what are we doing? What what's going on? We we've come to all Middle East and then we left. What did we get? We got nothing. We destroyed. I mean, we bombed the hell out of everything. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=136.0s)]
*  You know, when they went into when they took out Iraq for a thousand years with different names, you had Iran and Iraq, similar powers. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=148.44s)]
*  They were the two big ones. And for a thousand years, they would fight each other this way, this way, this way. Then that rest this way. This then that. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=160.56s)]
*  I think it's wild that Trump nails the exact like dumb American guys attitude about being at war, by the way, because he's like, you know, if you're going to go to war, you might as well steal all the resources, which we do, by the way. But Americans don't understand it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=169.23999999999998s)]
*  And they don't actually see the immediate benefit, the immediate material benefit of it, because like it's either going to the black budgets of the CIA in the terms of like the the poppy fields in Afghanistan, or it's going to, you know, Western oil. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=185.16s)]
*  So yeah, we do extract the loot. It's just like privatized and but that perfect way that a perfect way to claim anti war. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=199.12s)]
*  We're just in the Middle East and not even taking the loot in terms of in terms of Lashani. He's right. I'm actually going to put the oil in the West. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=209.96s)]
*  He's right. I'm actually going to point out once again how bad Trump has been in comparison to 2016 because the moment that Kamala Harris was like, Oh, this Chinese my goat. He should have been saying this. You should have been like, nonstop at every rally be like Liz Cheney sucks. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=220.48s)]
*  She wants to do endless war. I'm the peaceful candidate. I said it. I said it back then. I was like, this gives an incredible opening to the Republicans to present themselves once again as the anti war candidates. Even though, even though, you know, it's a lie. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=235.24s)]
*  A friend brought this up to me and I've never thought about it because I haven't seen any unclassified evidence for it. But do you think the part of the reason why we invaded Afghanistan and Iraq were because they're the countries directly the east the west of Iran and the State Department wanted to invade around down the line. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=250.64s)]
*  I mean, in theory, yes, that is absolutely true. That was the neo con pipe dream, which is like full scale invasion of, but it was Iraq was oil for the record. It was far before far before anything else. Like the Cheney wanted to invade Iraq and, and take the sweet juicy oil. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=274.6s)]
*  But as far as like Iran, yes, destabilizing or maybe even full tilt invading Iran was always also for oil and has always been like the final crowning achievement of the neo cons. That's why we say that's why we say that Kamala Harris did not have to get it did not have to give any concessions to get Dick Cheney and Liz Cheney on board because like this current democratic administration is basically achieving that agenda. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=295.92s)]
*  The dream of like active conflict with Iran. Anyway, can you give me counterpoints to use against my dad is one issues foreign policy believes Donald Trump is a peaceful dove type ask him why he destroyed the Iran denuclearization agreement. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=325.92s)]
*  Which he's going to say, Oh, but because it was bad. It was bad. Iran was supporting terrorism supporting terrorism in the region. Yeah, except [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=337.36s)]
*  The best possible pathway forward was normalizing relations with Iran, which Donald Trump and destroyed. It wasn't even a deal that America had put together by this by themselves. By the way, it was like multiple countries were involved in this deal took years and years to get to this point. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=344.96s)]
*  It was probably the signature achievement towards having like better relations with Iran in general in the region and and Donald Trump. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=358.4s)]
*  Cast it aside either the Abraham Accords, which again sidestep the Palestinians and made them feel understandably made them realize understandably that they were not a part of this process whatsoever. So as their [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=368.96s)]
*  As the Israeli occupation continued and greatly accelerated under the Trump administration, October 7 became an inevitability. Donald Trump has played a massive role, a massive role in October 7. Joe Biden has played a big role in October 7 as well. In the build up to October 7. He could have changed American foreign policy trajectory, but he did not. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=383.84s)]
*  Rest there were the self check. Then one day we go in and bomb the hell out of one. We destroy one and then all of a sudden Iran has the whole Middle East to itself. And by the way, right now, Iran has Iraq. Iraq is like a subsidiary of Iran. All right. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=407.44s)]
*  We did so many bad moves and her father was was it you know her father was I was very critical of her father for years. I'd never met him. But I'd say anybody that went into the Middle East, I thought was stupid. And he they say convince Bush Bush. Oh, he was just he was another beauty. But he supposedly convinced Bush to go in him. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=424.64s)]
*  Bolton and some other lightweights convinced them to go in. Let's go into the Middle East and destroy the whole place and millions of people. So they went in. But I was never a fan of China was always very critical. And when I announced that I was very critical, actually, not personally, but I said, he made a horrible mistake. What are these people doing this spending? We spent [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=448.24s)]
*  Despite the fact that war and Chinese are evil. Does Trump making the argument that this should be shot by a squad give you the slightest pause. No, I think the Trump statements about the enemy from within and how he's going to stick the military on them is significantly worse. Like, I think the argument that he was presenting about Liz Cheney here is a classic 2016 era Trump, where there is like a level of plausible deniability where he's like invoking a firing squad when he's describing something else. He's saying that like, Liz Cheney and those others aren't [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=469.92s)]
*  brave, our soldiers or military members are actually brave. Liz Cheney would be, you know, Liz Cheney doesn't know what it's like to be in the crosshairs. Like she doesn't know what it's like to be deployed, which Trump doesn't either by the way, he's a draft Audre. But like, the argument there is not about like, you know, putting Liz Cheney in front of a firing squad. And the what he's obviously contextually trying to say is that like, Liz Cheney would be singing a different tune if she actually was personally involved, as in if she actually [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=499.92s)]
*  was forced to, you know, serve in the military. Yeah. Yeah, he was trying to say politicians should serve in the front lines. Exactly. And he phrased it in a weird way. And I think the deliberate way he phrased it, he weirdly phrased it on purpose, so that he could have like, discourse run amok about how you say draft Audre, like that's not based. No, it is. It's the best thing he's ever done. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=529.92s)]
*  Nine trillion, trillion with a T, not even with a B. Normally I say not million, billion, but now I say not billion, trillion. We spent nine trillion dollars bombing the hell out of the Middle East. And what the hell did we get other than lots of dead people, all including our people? We got nothing. So I was very critical of him. And then I announced I was running and I was shocked that he was running. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=559.92s)]
*  He was one of the first people he endorsed me immediately. I said, That's amazing. But he had something that was very interesting. He had scooter liberty. I mean, these are little stories that are interesting. Scooter Liberty was a man that could have done great destruction to Bush. And they left him behind. He was given to the [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=589.92s)]
*  Like, I can't believe I'm saying this, but Zach Bo Schomp is right. Folks, Trump didn't threaten to execute Liz Cheney. He actually was calling her a chicken hawk. Something liberals have said about her for ages. Look at the context Trump is talking about giving her a weapon. Typically, people put in front of firing squads aren't armed. What is the nine barrel comment for it? If not a nod at a firing squad, you sound like such a jackass. The simple thing that candidates shouldn't graphically fantasize about opponents getting shot in the face, regardless of whether larger context or the point they're making is not complicated. Matthew Dowd, Lord have mercy. You know exactly what Trump meant. And what he has said, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=611.76s)]
*  Previously just stop. Yeah, I don't really care. Like, it's obvious that he phrased it like an insane person because he probably does fantasize about Liz Cheney getting shot in the mouth in a firing squad style situation. But it's also very obvious that within the context of that conversation, he's saying that she is a chicken hawk. Having said that, yeah, liberals getting mad at this is so stupid. Because Liz Cheney is a goddamn demon. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=641.76s)]
*  Okay, and so is Dick Cheney. Like, what the fuck are we doing? We're defending Liz Cheney's honor now. You might be this stupid. I mean, presumably you chose the avatar photo, but the rest of us are not. He wants her shot because she crossed him. When you cross him, he'll want you shot. This is how insane dictators work. But don't worry about enabling him. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=671.6s)]
*  Well, we're well actually in him. No, I just don't give a shit. I don't give a shit at all. Because Donald Trump has used so much violent rhetoric. This is another one of those instances. And also, I think like Dick Cheney being shot for treason or whatever the fuck this dipshit is fantasizing about is like, the least consequential violent thing he said. Like, does that make sense? Like, small talks about rounding up every single brown person. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=687.32s)]
*  Dude, and putting him in concentration camps. Like, you think I give a fuck about Liz Cheney? If I could deport Liz Cheney exile her to a fucking faraway island and save 20 million migrants from mass deportation. You think I wouldn't do that in a fucking heartbeat? Get out of here. The portless is tripled. I'm at three now. I'm kidding. I don't think anyone should be deported. Maybe Elon Musk. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=717.32s)]
*  Prosecutors, they prosecuted him rather. And he was almost like a sacrificial lamb. And as somebody that knows a lot about what's happening, I said, you know, if I were ever president, I'd do something with that guy. That guy got treated very badly. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=740.28s)]
*  Scooter Libby. And when I became president, I actually called Dick Cheney. I said, let me ask you about Scooter Libby. He was best friends. He was begging Bush to give Scooter Libby a pardon. But Bush didn't have the courage to do it. You know, it takes courage to give a pardon. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=755.24s)]
*  It does take a certain courage because the press comes after, you know, et cetera, et cetera. And he didn't have the courage to give me should have given him a pardon, but he didn't have the guts to do it. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=775.2s)]
*  But Scooter and and what happened is Dick Cheney for years, for a long time, hated Bush. And don't let anyone tell you he hated. He said, you don't leave your wounded behind. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=785.1600000000001s)]
*  And I understand that. And Scooter Libby really saved Bush because he could have said things that would have been very dangerous for Bush in terms of in terms of getting impeached in terms of going to jail in terms of bad things happening. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=801.12s)]
*  Scooter Libby didn't do that. And in all fairness to Cheney, I give him credit for this. He was very loyal to him, but he couldn't get Bush to do what he should have done. I came into government and I did what they should have done. They didn't have the guts to do it. I did it. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=819.08s)]
*  And Scooter Libby was pardoned. I gave him a pardon and I never met Scooter Libby, but I never talked to him before that. And I got a call from Scooter Libby after I did that. And he broke down in tears, thanking me so, so much. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=832.0400000000001s)]
*  And then Cheney called me and he said, that was so incredible what you did for Scooter Libby. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=849.04s)]
*  Who gives a fuck about Scooter Libby? Man, shut the fuck up. Jesus Christ. Bracking about pardoning neocons. Is this your king? Yeah, like I don't give a fuck about no Scooter Libby, bitch. Shut the fuck up. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=856.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, sure. She's a war hog. She kills people. She wanted to, even in my administration, she was pushing that we go to war with everybody. And I said, if you ever gave her a rifle and let her do the fighting, if you ever do that, she wouldn't be doing too well, I will tell you right now. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=880.0s)]
*  But she's a war hog who wants to go kill people unnecessarily. And if she had to do it herself and she had to face the consequences of battle, she wouldn't be doing it. So it's easy for her to talk, but she wouldn't be doing it. She's actually a disgrace. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=897.96s)]
*  Well, she is campaigning. I mean, she's campaigning. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=913.9200000000001s)]
*  You said last night, you said last night you would have Robert F. Kennedy Jr. do whatever he wants with healthcare. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=917.88s)]
*  Well, he's going to have a big role in healthcare. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=922.88s)]
*  In fact, we just left. In fact, I think he might be here. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=925.88s)]
*  He's right here. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=928.88s)]
*  Your control is set up. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=930.88s)]
*  His views on vaccines. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=932.88s)]
*  We'll be talking about a lot of things, but he's going to have a big role in healthcare. A very big role. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=934.88s)]
*  Is it HHS maybe? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=938.88s)]
*  He knows it better than anybody. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=940.88s)]
*  We're so fucking cucked. God damn, dude. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=943.84s)]
*  He's got some views that I happen to agree with very strongly and I have for a long time. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=948.8000000000001s)]
*  For years, you and I would agree. We'll be seeing it as a... [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=952.8000000000001s)]
*  What about the Google vaccine and maybe a position at HHS? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=955.8000000000001s)]
*  All of these things will be talked about in the next meeting. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=958.8000000000001s)]
*  This meeting is more to come. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=960.8000000000001s)]
*  I think it's crazy that RFKs within a striking distance of just destroying what remains of the American medical structure. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=962.8000000000001s)]
*  I can't begin to explain to you how fucking insane this shit is. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=970.8000000000001s)]
*  Anyway. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=975.76s)]
*  Trump receives plaque promoting peace from Arab American leaders. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=977.76s)]
*  I can't believe it. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=989.76s)]
*  I can't believe it. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=991.76s)]

*  I can't believe it. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=999.76s)]
*  I can't believe it. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1001.76s)]
*  A wise man once said, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1004.72s)]
*  Peace is the prize and I stand before him today. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1006.72s)]
*  As Arab Americans, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1008.72s)]
*  We unite against the betrayal of those in power. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1010.72s)]
*  Our families back home suffer their cries for help echoing across borders while the world remains silent. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1012.72s)]
*  It is time to prio- [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1020.72s)]
*  Dude, what a fucking... [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1022.72s)]
*  What a thing. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1024.72s)]
*  What an insane thing. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1026.72s)]
*  Not only is he the Muslim ban president, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1028.72s)]
*  but he's doing more aesthetically. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1031.68s)]
*  He's doing more. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1033.68s)]
*  The Muslim ban president is doing more aesthetically to like at least make it seem like he gives a fuck about Arab voters than the Democratic party is. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1035.68s)]
*  Democratic party is like actively trying to push away Arab voters while he's over here being like, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1043.68s)]
*  Yeah, I'll come over. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1049.68s)]
*  I'll let you fuckers, you fucking barbarians talk to me. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1051.68s)]
*  I'll be in your presence. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1057.68s)]
*  You can say he uses Palestinian as a slur till the fucking cows come home. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1060.64s)]
*  It does not matter. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1064.64s)]
*  Okay? [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1066.64s)]
*  You can say that all day every day, but it doesn't matter. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1068.64s)]
*  Not only is it the Democratic party that's currently conducting the genocide in Israel, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1070.64s)]
*  but also on top of that, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1074.64s)]
*  like guys, guys, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1076.64s)]
*  since the election has heated up in the last like four or five days, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1078.64s)]
*  I haven't talked about this much, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1080.64s)]
*  but like Israel killed 92 people yesterday. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1082.64s)]
*  Like Israel's killing like a hundred people every day in Gaza, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1084.64s)]
*  in North Gaza specifically. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1089.6000000000001s)]
*  Okay? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1091.6000000000001s)]
*  And I don't think these guys are like honest people. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1093.6000000000001s)]
*  I'll say it. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1095.6000000000001s)]
*  I don't think these are honest brokers at all. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1097.6000000000001s)]
*  This is a striking moment, but it isn't a damning moment for Muslim and Arabs. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1099.6000000000001s)]
*  As many Americans may think it is, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1101.6000000000001s)]
*  is the sign of a demise of the Democratic party, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1103.6000000000001s)]
*  even in its ability to maintain optics. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1105.6000000000001s)]
*  And optics are a core of politics. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1107.6000000000001s)]
*  Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, and the Democratic party have refused to even share a stage with Arabs, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1109.6000000000001s)]
*  Muslims, Palestinians, not even for the sake of optics or for the sake of electoral interests. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1111.6000000000001s)]
*  Instead, Harris and her party has chosen the castigate and marginalized Arabs and Muslims, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1113.6000000000001s)]
*  who overwhelmingly vote Democrat at every single turn. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1118.56s)]
*  These men with Trump are a handful of Muslim Arab leaders [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1120.56s)]
*  out of millions of Muslims in the country. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1122.56s)]
*  Not all Arabs are Muslim and not all Muslims are Arab. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1124.56s)]
*  And between these communities is a vast spectrum of politics and political engagement. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1126.56s)]
*  Muslim Arabs have endorsed Jill Stein and third party candidates. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1128.56s)]
*  And over 150 Imams, clerics, and a letter, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1130.56s)]
*  Muslim Arabs have endorsed supported Harris. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1132.56s)]
*  Zoghbi, M. Gage, Mehdi Hassan, Uncommitted-ish. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1134.56s)]
*  Black Muslims have been on both sides of this. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1136.56s)]
*  Our communities aren't monolithic. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1138.56s)]
*  There is no doubt that overwhelmingly, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1140.56s)]
*  the Arab community is not monolithic. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1142.56s)]
*  But the Muslim community is not monolithic. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1144.56s)]
*  The Muslim Arab community is not monolithic. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1147.52s)]
*  There is no doubt that overwhelmingly, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1149.52s)]
*  Arab and Muslim communities are against the US-backed Israeli genocide of the Palestinians. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1151.52s)]
*  And it's safe to say that almost every single Muslim in Arab filling out a ballot [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1153.52s)]
*  will be thinking about Gaza. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1155.52s)]
*  But many will not even be going to the ballot box. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1157.52s)]
*  The question of voting for a party who actively overseeing the genocide of 2.2 million people, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1159.52s)]
*  including over a million children, aside, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1161.52s)]
*  the Democrats have given absolutely nothing to voters. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1163.52s)]
*  Arab, Muslim, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1165.52s)]
*  Wait, hold on. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1167.52s)]
*  Hold on. Sorry. One second. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1169.52s)]
*  I'm securing a... [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1171.52s)]
*  While I'm having this conversation, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1173.52s)]
*  I'm also securing a podcast guest. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1176.48s)]
*  Okay? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1178.48s)]
*  Because I'm goaded like that. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1180.48s)]
*  That's bullshit. The Dems can't risk the votes. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1182.48s)]
*  The orange monster needs to be dealt with first. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1184.48s)]
*  Liberals are so funny, dude. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1186.48s)]
*  You're right. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1188.48s)]
*  You should tell people whose family members have been slaughtered with their own tax dollars. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1190.48s)]
*  You should tell people whose family members have been slaughtered with their own tax dollars. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1192.48s)]
*  That, you know, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1194.48s)]
*  Fuck you, Hassan, you libtard. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1196.48s)]
*  Okay? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1198.48s)]
*  Anyway, the question of voting for a party actively overseeing the genocide, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1200.48s)]
*  aside, the Democrats have given absolutely nothing to voters. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1202.48s)]
*  Arab, Muslim, and to others to show that they even want to pretend to care. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1205.44s)]
*  Instead, they kick out Muslims from Harris rallies and yell, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1207.44s)]
*  I don't give a fuck about Gaza, I have babies. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1209.44s)]
*  Trump did the easiest thing to the Democrats, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1211.44s)]
*  and Harris couldn't. He welcomed some Arabs and Muslims [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1213.44s)]
*  to share the stage with him. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1215.44s)]
*  He embraced them. The Democrats, Biden, Harris, have categorically refused to. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1217.44s)]
*  The narrative has been, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1219.44s)]
*  and will continue to be, that Arabs and Muslims are supporting Trump. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1221.44s)]
*  That isn't true. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1223.44s)]
*  Our communities are pushing against the genocide of our people. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1225.44s)]
*  Some in our communities are choosing to side with current genocide heirs. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1227.44s)]
*  Some are choosing to side with future genocide heirs. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1229.44s)]
*  But the majority are choosing to side with the future genocide heirs. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1231.44s)]
*  The majority are choosing to stand against both. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1234.4s)]
*  Donald Trump is not, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1236.4s)]
*  he's not going to be fucking pro-Palestine. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1238.4s)]
*  Let's be real. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1240.4s)]
*  Not a cult, look at this shit. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1242.4s)]
*  I did see this shit. This is awesome. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1244.4s)]
*  It's awesome because one of the kids is the shooter. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1246.4s)]
*  Like, what the fuck? [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1248.4s)]
*  I know they've bickered for days, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1250.4s)]
*  deciding who would be Trump. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1252.4s)]
*  I'm sorry, I don't mean to sound hard. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1254.4s)]
*  This is sheer representation on a conservative stage. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1256.4s)]
*  I don't have to flip the vote from genocide to genocide. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1258.4s)]
*  That's don't fuck shit. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1260.4s)]
*  And one party is actively pushing away Arab voters [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1263.3600000000001s)]
*  and the other party is at least aesthetically trying to court voters. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1265.3600000000001s)]
*  What the fuck do you expect from voters to see? [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1267.3600000000001s)]
*  Like, I don't think it's correct. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1269.3600000000001s)]
*  I think it's fucking silly. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1271.3600000000001s)]
*  But you're out of your fucking mind. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1273.3600000000001s)]
*  If you, like you should be in, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1275.3600000000001s)]
*  you shouldn't be angry at the voters in this situation [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1277.3600000000001s)]
*  that you've, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1279.3600000000001s)]
*  that you have perceived as like voting at a turn or some shit. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1281.3600000000001s)]
*  Okay? [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1283.3600000000001s)]
*  You should be fucking yelling at the Democratic party [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1285.3600000000001s)]
*  for actively pushing away Arab voters. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1287.3600000000001s)]
*  Like, you should be fucking yelling at the Democratic party [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1289.3600000000001s)]
*  for actively pushing away Muslims and Arabs [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1292.32s)]

*  You know what I mean? [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1296.32s)]
*  Like, what are we doing? [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1298.32s)]
*  I can't help but notice that liberals [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1300.32s)]
*  are immediate, like, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1302.32s)]
*  voters are the problem, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1304.32s)]
*  not the party. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1306.32s)]
*  Attitude has come back super strong [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1308.32s)]
*  with only a couple days out from the election. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1310.32s)]
*  Campaigns need to earn people's votes. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1312.32s)]
*  That is the underlying principle of democracy. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1314.32s)]
*  You know? [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1316.32s)]
*  I think it's pretty nutty though [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1318.32s)]
*  that Donald Trump is like taking the time out [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1321.28s)]
*  to even aesthetically look like he gives a shit [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1325.28s)]

*  Maybe your chatters don't know what's happening [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1329.28s)]
*  in northern Gaza. People are desperate for fuck's sake. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1331.28s)]

*  Northern Gaza is literally a Holocaust zone right now [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R-kAnWHYuA&t=1337.28s)]
