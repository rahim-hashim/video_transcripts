# Fast-moving Wildfire Erupts In Pacific Palisades | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk)
*  is all the billionaire homes are burning brother. I don't know how to explain this to you, but [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=0.0s)]
*  it's not just rich people that get that lose their lives in their homes in this process. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=6.16s)]
*  It's going to be quite difficult for you to comprehend. I know, but it's usually the really [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=11.28s)]
*  rich people that can avoid the worst of the worst. And it's always, it's almost always [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=16.580000000000002s)]
*  the, the normal folk and poor people that actually get cooked in this process. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=24.34s)]
*  Like I'm reminded of the time where kind of was hired a private brigade of firefighters [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=34.58s)]
*  basically create a security. Oh my God. Wait, why is there no audio? My family and our praying [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=43.86s)]
*  for you, Kai and Austin. Okay. This is like, Oh my God. Oh my God. That is crazy. What [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=65.46000000000001s)]
*  the heck? So strong and maybe too strong for them to fly. So that's what we're concerned [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=76.86000000000001s)]
*  with. The bad news is the winds are going to continue to be really dangerous and damaging [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=82.02000000000001s)]
*  information per the radio traffic that the Getty Villa, the light coming in fire, which [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=86.30000000000001s)]
*  your window is orange. I haven't looked outside yet, but it's not [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=93.89999999999999s)]
*  the Villa area and impacting coastline drive as well. It's approaching that area along [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=99.5s)]
*  coastline drive. And as you were mentioning Maria, there's about five hours left of daylight. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=106.34s)]
*  When you think about it and that's the operational hours that are going to be most significant [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=112.69999999999999s)]
*  go outside. No, I'm too scared to look outside straight up, which is great for right now. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=117.62s)]
*  So we're not looking at these extreme wind gusts. So this is that window. Yep. The window [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=124.10000000000001s)]
*  of opportunity is right now. And they're certainly trying to take advantage of that. The fire [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=128.42000000000002s)]
*  is blowing in the exact opposite direction. So I think I'm safe in West Hollywood, but [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=132.3s)]
*  it is kind of crazy that it's just like ripping through the palisades. You're so oblivious. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=136.5s)]
*  Dog, Lamau. No, it completely like it completely moved. I think it went from the valley directly [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=142.14s)]
*  to the ocean. So it's pushing here. Here's the live fire map. Let's take a look. Hold [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=152.33999999999997s)]
*  on. Nevermind. There's other places where there's fires going on as well. But [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=160.06s)]
*  this is not the best map. I mean, it is the best map, but like it's nerdy. I need better [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=172.14s)]
*  visuals to understand. Bro, that million dollar house is your house, right? Yeah. We're getting [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=182.61999999999998s)]
*  reports of spotting on both sides of the palisades drive area. So it is going further south toward [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=190.29999999999998s)]
*  the ocean. So please stay alert. We do. We do have Haley Winslow right now with us. Hey, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=199.3s)]
*  Haley, let us know where you are and who you're with. And they have a mandatory evac in the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=205.70000000000002s)]
*  palisades right now, according to the L.A. Fire Department. If you're near the Topanga [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=211.86s)]
*  State Park down really from the Getty, it looks very all the way up to Santa Monica. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=216.26000000000002s)]
*  Traffic was insane trying to get here gridlocked. And I've got a very dear friend on the line [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=220.54000000000002s)]
*  right now, Eric Robertson, who is trapped in the fire. I got him on my other cell phone on [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=225.18s)]
*  speakerphone so he can describe the plan from his perspective. He's been sending me videos. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=231.22s)]
*  We're having a hard time getting them in. Eric, what's going on where you are? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=236.38s)]
*  Well, we're in the middle of the Palisades. This is where West Hollywood is. Okay. This is [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=240.94s)]
*  where the fire is and the fire is blowing towards the ocean. So around us on one side is just [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=247.70000000000002s)]
*  billowing smoke. We were standing about 100 yards away from where the fire started. Right [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=255.34s)]
*  when it started, we were up for a walk and the flames were 30, 50 feet tall. The helicopters [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=261.1s)]
*  dropped load after load of water and it still kept spreading so quickly. So it's traveled all [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=267.9s)]
*  the way down the hill. It's mostly it's crossed Palisades Drive, which is close to Sunset Boulevard. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=275.3s)]
*  Here the PCH. It's our only exit and there's a car on fire down there. One of our neighbors [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=281.42s)]
*  tried to drive down. They were turned back because the road is surrounded by fire. So we really have [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=286.82s)]
*  to stay put for now. The fire isn't immediately upon us, but it's really close and it's pretty scary. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=294.02s)]
*  Okay. Yeah, they're showing your dude. Imagine you're a fish and you're chilling. All of a sudden, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=301.78s)]
*  this big ass plane comes in and just picks you up and then dumps you on top of a fire. All of a [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=306.14s)]
*  sudden, you're charred tuna. You know, it's crazy. It's been gridlocked and we're hearing now that [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=311.85999999999996s)]
*  the Getty Villa is being impacted. They're about to evacuate coastline drive and people are [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=317.09999999999997s)]
*  basically having to abandon their cars because, you know, they're not able to drive through. What's [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=323.14s)]
*  going on in your neighborhood? Like what are people? I'm sure they're not, you know, they're, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=330.34s)]
*  you know, on edge. We're all in our garages outside, you know, kind of waiting for the all clear. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=336.9s)]
*  Everyone's got their bags packed. We're kind of poised to run away once we're able to, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=343.85999999999996s)]
*  but at the moment we just have to stay put. Those planes have fish whistles on them. Wait, what? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=349.29999999999995s)]
*  There's only that one street, so there's not much we can do for now. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=353.86s)]
*  So why can't you get out? What makes you trapped? The roads close, right? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=357.22s)]
*  What makes you trapped? Look at the, the PCH is already gridlock all the time. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=361.22s)]
*  It's not shocking that it would be extra gridlock during a fire. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=368.26s)]
*  Because the road is shut for now. All right. Well, be really careful. Thank you very much. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=383.94s)]
*  I'll call you back in a little bit and check on you guys. But yeah, thanks Eric. Bye. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=390.34000000000003s)]
*  Those Eric Robertson, he is right there in the middle of it and the thick of it. And you can [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=394.34000000000003s)]
*  hear the sirens. I mean, it's nonstop. I mean, police driving on both sides of the road. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=397.7s)]
*  Everyone's pretty much driving like a maniac when you can finally move. And yeah, again, the sky [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=404.90000000000003s)]
*  just very ominous out here. You can't even see the Santa Monica mountains at all. And I know [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=410.66s)]
*  Maria's probably kept you very well updated with the weather, but the winds just in the last 40 [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=415.94s)]
*  minutes, I've seen 35 mile per hour wind gusts and it's looking like overnight tonight and tomorrow. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=421.46000000000004s)]
*  It's going to be like 65 to 70 mile per hour beginning. This isn't even the peak of this [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=427.14000000000004s)]
*  Santa Ana wind event that we're hearing could be the strongest of the season. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=433.70000000000005s)]
*  Eroxia? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=440.02s)]
*  Yeah, well Maria's standing right next to me and she was just mentioning how up top the winds are much [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=440.98s)]
*  even stronger. Yeah. So you're reporting this at the surface and you know that up at the higher [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=447.22s)]
*  elevations it's going to be gusting now closer to between 60 and 80 plus miles an hour. Captain [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=453.14s)]
*  Eric Scott was saying how the conditions out there today are so bad that we have to go back to, he [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=459.54s)]
*  was saying even 2011 was the last time that we saw the dynamics in place. At least all the billionaire [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=467.62s)]
*  homes are burning brother. I don't know how to explain this to you, but it's not just rich people [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=474.58s)]
*  that get that lose their lives and their homes in this process. It's going to be quite difficult [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=480.74s)]
*  for you to comprehend. I know, but it's usually the really rich people that can avoid the worst of the [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=486.5s)]
*  worst. And it's always, it's almost always the, the normal folk and poor people that actually get [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=492.5s)]
*  cooked in this process. Like I'm reminded of the time where kind of was hired a private brigade of [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=503.06s)]
*  firefighters to basically create a security perimeter around his house soon. But this is [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=514.74s)]
*  just such a hard situation for so many residents there who are under that evacuation order, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=522.1800000000001s)]
*  trying to leave perhaps can't because of the traffic, but where are they going to go on foot? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=527.78s)]
*  You know, that's the big question, right? How far can they go and, and who's going to help? So [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=532.82s)]
*  uh, you can tell that, you know, it's probably like the last resort. Okay, great. So I think [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=538.5s)]
*  our photographer Armando connected us with this gentleman. Hello, sir. Can you hear me? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=544.82s)]
*  Can you hear us? If you could speak into the microphone, the microphone, maybe there we go. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=551.94s)]
*  Hold the microphone up to your mouth. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=560.1s)]
*  Maybe. Hold the microphone. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=562.66s)]
*  There you go. I don't hear anybody. Yes, we hear you. Do you hear us? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=566.98s)]
*  We hear him, but he can't hear us. Looks like he's what is happening with local television, man. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=570.98s)]
*  We hold on. Okay. He's there getting set up right there. As we continue to look at this shot from [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=578.1s)]
*  Will Rogers, this is where the command post is going to be set up and where Haley is right now. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=585.4599999999999s)]
*  Um, so she was speaking with a friend of hers who's in Palisades, Thailand's area, right? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=590.6600000000001s)]
*  And they had nowhere to go. That right there is the most LA fit. He's got the cap on, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=598.9000000000001s)]
*  he's got the thermal with the shorts on a, on a fixed gear bike. My man is L eight out the wazoo [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=603.5400000000001s)]
*  right there picking his nose on live TV. Hopefully he and his family will be okay. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=611.3800000000001s)]
*  What's your name? Yes, I hear you guys. Hi, do you have someone you need to speak with? Hey, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=617.14s)]
*  hey, Roxia. Yeah, this was my new friend. Right when we got off the air, he was showing me a video. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=624.02s)]
*  He works up there in the Palisades and saw a bunch of cars on fire. Tell me what you saw. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=628.8199999999999s)]
*  Oh, so it was just cars backed up. Uh, on the way up, there's a bunch of cars that are abandoned. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=636.5s)]
*  So, um, let me show this. Come on over here. What are we doing? Yo, he was showing us on fire. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=642.1800000000001s)]
*  Cars on fire. But, um, yeah. So anyways, I started all the way from the top and all these cars [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=654.9s)]
*  aren't going anywhere because some cars are abandoned. And on the other side, you know, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=660.5s)]
*  on the way up, I saw like a pantry on fire. So I ended up like brushing it off, taking it off. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=665.22s)]
*  And then on my way back down, I started seeing the car on fire. So here it is. There it is. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=670.66s)]
*  So all that other side is abandoned. So that's only going to get worse. And then see the van, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=676.98s)]
*  you guys. So where people are abandoning their cars, is it on the side of the road or just in [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=681.4599999999999s)]
*  the middle of the street? All fun and games is it gets a freaky note of like, Oh, I see you. I see [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=687.54s)]
*  you on TV. King, you looking hot as hell. My heart burns for you. Like those cars that you're showing. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=693.54s)]
*  It's the main road that goes up. I don't know. I don't know. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=701.2199999999999s)]
*  And then you can see Sandra on both. Yeah. Also, you know, there were parents in Topanga [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=705.86s)]
*  Canyon to drive and escape. So this could be insanely dangerous. Yeah. It's really bad. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=712.8199999999999s)]
*  I'm not defending the earlier chatter. They were obviously wrong, but it's a possible they think [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=718.26s)]
*  everyone from Cali are rich AF compared to the trailer park life. Yes. And it's wrong. Obviously [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=721.3s)]
*  there's no area where there's exclusively wealthy people in California, maybe like Bel Air or [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=727.62s)]
*  something. But even then there's gardeners, maids, things of that nature, living in these houses. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=732.42s)]
*  And they will always have a harder time evacuating than the rich people. Try to get it to as soon as [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=736.82s)]
*  possible. But yeah, it's just the magnitude of this fire. And again, this is only the beginning [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=740.5s)]
*  already up to 200 acres. That's another challenge that people are facing there. Thank you, Haley. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=746.26s)]
*  The fact that the cell service is very spotty in that area to begin with on a good day. Now on top [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=750.74s)]
*  of that with these wind gusts and probably some power outages because these power lines are going [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=756.98s)]
*  down because of this fire and the smoke really impacting this area. So imagine if you're a [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=761.62s)]
*  resident living in these communities, trying to get the latest updates or trying to connect with [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=766.82s)]
*  some, the average home price in Palisades is 3.5 million. So I don't give an F. Yeah, exactly. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=771.94s)]
*  The average, which means that every house obviously is for wealthy people and no such poor [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=778.1s)]
*  people even work in those houses. Also there's still people like, I don't think they should die [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=785.38s)]
*  either. That's a crazy, crazy concept. Once again, once again, we're doing the, I don't care. I don't [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=790.02s)]
*  care about the systems. I only want the people to suffer. Listen, I am not in the business of [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=799.78s)]
*  undermining American government institutions. Okay. I want the American people to suffer. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=807.14s)]
*  It takes like, it's takes like this. It makes people hate this community chest. Sometimes you [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=812.82s)]
*  got to pretend like you're in a room full of humans. Yeah, I know it is takes like this that [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=817.62s)]
*  annoy people. And then I can't be the one correcting people because then they go says you, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=823.3000000000001s)]
*  it's cause you're rich too. You should die in a fire as well. And it's like, okay, sure dog, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=828.1800000000001s)]
*  just like, please, please have a semblance of normalcy for once in your life. Oh my Lord. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=833.7800000000001s)]
*  Speak to those people. It was hard to make that connection and they probably [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=838.74s)]
*  aren't quite in the mood to speak anyway, trying to get out of the area. Not sure how far they're [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=843.54s)]
*  going to get with having to be on foot. Of course we are still waiting there. Will Roger, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=848.5s)]
*  state beach there on the right side of your screen. That parking lot right there is where [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=855.62s)]
*  the command post will be where we can get hopefully some updated information. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=860.02s)]
*  It's a little tough right now because obviously all hands on deck and they are focused on getting [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=864.98s)]
*  this fire under control before they're able to relay information out to the public. But that'll [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=871.22s)]
*  be the gathering point. And it's tough for news crews to even get there. We just saw one news van [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=877.3000000000001s)]
*  pull up, but you can see this fire broke out at 10 and at this point now, just crews are arriving, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=882.9s)]
*  even Haley getting there and she said traffic was so backed up. It's so hard to get through [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=890.1s)]
*  these locations and that's the situation. Not only are our news vehicles dealing with, but first [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=895.38s)]
*  responders too trying to get through all of the people. And there is a checkpoint at this point [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=902.4200000000001s)]
*  at PCH in Tomasko Canyon because of the fact that so many people were trying to get to the area. Oh, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=908.66s)]
*  look at that beautiful drop right there. That's what we've been looking at along this vantage point [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=914.18s)]
*  of PCH by Will Rogers. And that's a good thing that we've been looking at these super scoopers [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=921.6999999999999s)]
*  picking up water from the ocean and then making those drops. You're looking at just a full screen [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=929.38s)]
*  right there if you can snap a picture or just write down the information evacuation center at Westwood [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=936.9799999999999s)]
*  recreation center. That's at 1350 South Sepulveda. If you're able to get there or pass that [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=943.22s)]
*  information along to others who may be able to use that information. Let's see. We're looking at people [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=951.62s)]
*  in their cars trying to make their way out of the area. But there is literally nothing out. Like [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=957.62s)]
*  we have clear blue skies, dude, clear blue skies. I don't see no smoke. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=965.14s)]
*  It's blowing entirely away from me. When I, when I lived in the Brentwood area, which is ironically [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=973.06s)]
*  also a very wealthy neighborhood where I of course lived in the old apartments with like [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=981.14s)]
*  multiple roommates when I was broke as hell. I remember once having to evacuate [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=986.98s)]
*  and then the [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=995.78s)]
*  change, you know, when they depart and usually go out to sea. Right. Now they're going east and taking off that way. Even President Biden canceling his planned news conference here and dedication for two new [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=999.88s)]
*  monuments in Southern California canceled that they're going to be doing that virtually instead. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1011.3s)]
*  We had some, some video earlier of Ontario International Airport and how windy it was there. So [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1017.38s)]
*  really, this is just a reminder for everybody. If you live in the area under this [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1023.8599999999999s)]
*  data, it was yours. He was actually broke a effort one point. No, I'm reminding people that like, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1028.5s)]
*  there are literally people that live in apartments there that are broke. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1036.26s)]
*  Just like I was, even though I was in a rich neighborhood, technically [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1039.86s)]
*  canyons up in the Hollywood Hills. You want to make sure you look at the parking restrictions. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1043.3s)]
*  And when you're, if you're at home, you want to turn your car so that it's ready to go. You want to reverse in [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1048.82s)]
*  so that you are ready to go when or if that time comes for you, especially around this area here in [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1054.98s)]
*  the Palisades, Santa Monica, Malibu, just downwind of this fire. So we have what's what we're like [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1061.22s)]
*  four hours, a little bit over four hours of daylight, right? Yeah. Sunsets are going to be [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1069.86s)]
*  about 5 PM. And then after that, it's going to get rapidly darker, of course, but that is unfortunately [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1074.8999999999999s)]
*  when we expect the winds to start to really pick up again later this evening into the overnight [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1080.9799999999998s)]
*  hours. So it's really critical that they get a handle on this fire right now. The fixed wing, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1087.06s)]
*  yeah, the fixed wing aircraft is able to go up. I don't know. I haven't seen any, it's crazy because [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1091.9399999999998s)]
*  there's a fire on Sunset and La Cienega from this vantage point, but hopefully as the chatter is [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1096.82s)]
*  saying, but like I can't see anything. Like there's nothing here. You know, but this is, as you [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1101.9399999999998s)]
*  mentioned, the window of opportunity to really make some progress. There's a out already. Oh, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1108.82s)]
*  okay. It's challenging and it's only going to get worse. Yeah. We heard Captain talk about how when [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1113.46s)]
*  you see a fire, those first 20 minutes are so critical. And if, if, if they can't get a handle [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1119.06s)]
*  on it, then they're going to be talking hundreds, just a few acres. Right. And we saw that happen. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1125.9399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. We saw that in front of our eyes. It started as 10 acres. It blew up to more than 200. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1130.26s)]
*  Like within half an hour. Yeah. Within half an hour, well under an hour at this point. And then [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1135.6999999999998s)]
*  now who knows? It's definitely grown. Yeah. Right. We're over 200 acres. Yeah, for sure. I know that [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1141.06s)]
*  they're setting up the command center and that post in Will Rogers, that state beach. And so [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1147.62s)]
*  hopefully, uh, at some point we'll get an update and official update from them. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1153.3s)]
*  But at the moment, as we take a look at this live image, look at the tops of these trees [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1157.94s)]
*  and how much stronger those winds are. So you can imagine where the fire is burning, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1163.86s)]
*  how much stronger even those winds are blowing and from all directions, because [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1169.54s)]
*  fires create their own weather. And although the prevailing winds are coming out the Northeast [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1173.94s)]
*  and around the fire, it's just really very erratic and it's coming from all directions. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1180.02s)]
*  As that air rises, it sucks in all the air around it. And as we get closer to nightfall, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1184.9s)]
*  the wind is really going to pick up, you said. Yeah. Those wind gusts are expected to be between [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1192.42s)]
*  60 to 80 miles an hour. Um, it could even clock in between 90 and 100. That's [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1196.74s)]
*  hurricane force winds in terms of those wind gusts. So that can do a lot of damage, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1204.42s)]
*  not just from the wind itself, but just in terms of the fire and how, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1209.62s)]
*  how much it's going to help it to spread and, uh, carry those embers, you know, far away from the [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1213.6999999999998s)]
*  start of the fire. And we've been looking at the resources that have been battling this blaze for [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1219.3799999999999s)]
*  quite some time now, especially from the air. We've been seeing those super scoopers pick up [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1223.78s)]
*  that ocean water and make those dramatic drops. But we do know that there are more than a hundred [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1229.3s)]
*  firefighters at this point tackling this and trying to emergency crews are able to get through [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1234.34s)]
*  to some extent. But if you take a look just beyond, you can see the fire on the hillside [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1242.58s)]
*  and the winds that are whipping, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1251.62s)]
*  seeing the danger that still remains and people still little by little trying to make it down that [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1255.3799999999999s)]
*  Oh, cyber truck. Yeah. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1264.6599999999999s)]
*  Barbara Dickerson there, uh, setting the scene. Yo, stay away from that. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1266.58s)]
*  Live there on Palisades drive. And she said things have actually sort of, excuse me, calm down, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1270.82s)]
*  smooth out here a bit, uh, from her last live shot here. Yeah. We want to bring in chief Sam, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1277.6999999999998s)]
*  Gigi, Ovana, chief. We see those flare ups there next to those cars. I mean, this is so concerning [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1283.06s)]
*  again, we can see another car, uh, catch on fire because of this. And then of course we've got those [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1289.7s)]
*  embers to deal with, with the winds being so erratic. Hello, chief. Chief. Are you with us? [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1295.22s)]
*  Yes. Can you hear me? We got you now? Yeah. Yeah. Um, this could be palm fronds that are dropped, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1305.14s)]
*  you know, that caught fire and are burning, but I want to go back to something, you know, let's, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1311.14s)]
*  we talk about the wind and topography driven, but it's also, let's go back. We've had a lot of rain [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1315.62s)]
*  over the past few years. There's a lot of heavy fuels in these hillsides. And then let's not [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1322.1s)]
*  forget these homes can actually become a fuel itself. If we go back to the coastal fire in May [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1327.3s)]
*  of 2022 in Orange County, it wasn't not a Santa Ana wind driven day. It was just a normal day with [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1334.18s)]
*  an ocean breeze going up a hill, caught a home on fire. That home spread to a home, which ended [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1340.9s)]
*  up resulting in 20 homes destroyed. So sometimes you get the fuel that's the problem, the topography, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1346.9s)]
*  the wind, and then even homes are like fuel themselves that can spread from home to home. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1353.7s)]
*  So again, we will say chief Sam, based on the conditions, based on the topography, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1360.8200000000002s)]
*  we're not at all surprised at what we're seeing here and how it's all playing out. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1367.14s)]
*  No, not at all. You know, and we talk about this, Michael, you know, even [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1371.0600000000002s)]
*  days where we did not have such strong winds and such a significant event like this, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1375.0600000000002s)]
*  the danger living in Southern California, it's just here. Let's, let's fast forward this. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1380.02s)]
*  If the wind stops. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1385.3000000000002s)]
*  Enough, Sladdy Matty, enough. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1386.3400000000001s)]
*  Feel remains high because everything now is even more dried out. We may not have the wind, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1388.8200000000002s)]
*  but we certainly have the topography and the fuel. If a fire breaks out, the risk is going to remain [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1394.18s)]
*  with us for a while. We're going to need at least five to seven times the money to get money. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1399.46s)]
*  The fuel moisture content in the hillside change where it doesn't burn so easily. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1404.1000000000001s)]
*  All right, chief Sam, with that, we're going to pause, put you on pause here for just a second [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1409.14s)]
*  and remind our viewers here. It's now 1 PM and you're watching the NBC four news live breaking [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1413.22s)]
*  coverage of the wildfire burning now in Pacific Palisades. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1419.3s)]
*  Yeah, this is the latest information from LA fire. About 200 acres have burned so far. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1424.82s)]
*  Evacuations have been ordered between Mary Mack road west to Topanga Canyon and south to PCH. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1429.94s)]
*  The Westwood recreation center is now open for anyone and then evacuated people who do need a [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1436.8999999999999s)]
*  place to go can go there. They also allow small animals as we've been showing you all morning [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1442.8999999999999s)]
*  long and into the afternoon. We're seeing gridlock and PCA's and on other major roadways as people [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1447.86s)]
*  try to get out of that area. The LA fire department now telling everyone head southbound on Palisades [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1452.82s)]
*  drive to westbound sunset, the southbound Pacific Coast Highway. As you can see, there's a significant [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1459.62s)]
*  loom up behind us. We're going to show you on the map where the fire is, where it's going, and what [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1467.3s)]
*  our evac concerns are. This is the Pacific Palisades Highland community. The fire is burning [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1471.94s)]
*  in a westward direction through here. So we want an evacuation warning for all of this area that [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1479.7s)]
*  is going to be from Topanga Canyon. For people asking, that's actually not that far away from me [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1486.3400000000001s)]
*  at all. Technically, technically it's like, you know, without traffic 25 to 30 minutes away, which [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1492.5s)]
*  is really close for LA standards. Having said that, or proximity wise is even closer than that. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1500.66s)]
*  If you straight shot it, but because it's in the mountains, it's harder to get to. Having said that, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1510.3400000000001s)]
*  having said that the fire is going in the exact opposite direction, it's going away from me. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1516.26s)]
*  Students will be moved to Brentwood Elementary Science Magnet, Paul Revere Charter Middle School. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1521.78s)]
*  Students are being taken to University High School Charter. That's right, and schools are [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1527.62s)]
*  communicating directly with those families. If you have any questions, you can call the [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1531.78s)]
*  LA USD Family Hotline. That number is 213-443-1300. All right, 102 here on a... Can you see your house [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1536.58s)]
*  from here? No, dude, I'm not anywhere near the coastline. She's with LA City Fire. Yeah, it's the [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1544.1s)]
*  winds. Thank you for being with us. Central Committee, it is the winds. We have 80 to 50... [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1549.1399999999999s)]
*  They were talking about 80 to 50 mile gusts of wind. And of course, predictably the winds [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1553.62s)]
*  immediately... The winds immediately turned us into a massive issue. Melissa McGee and again, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1558.74s)]
*  winds have the capacity to knock out power lines because our infrastructure is not hardened against [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1567.46s)]
*  that sort of thing, because why would it be that would be woke? Also Israel is in desperate need [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1571.94s)]
*  of funds. Hello, don't be selfish and anti-Semitic. Also we do give billions of dollars to these [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1577.54s)]
*  public utility companies anyway, too hard in their infrastructure and then they never do it because, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1587.94s)]
*  excuse me, that's the profit motive. And then on top of that, I don't even know what actually [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1592.98s)]
*  started this one, but the winds carry the fire pretty fast. The fuel is all of the brush, the trees, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1602.26s)]
*  anything flying embers in the air as well. Things have been very dry here in Southern California. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1612.66s)]
*  We've seen 0.16 inches of rain here in LA County. We should be closer to a little bit more than four [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1618.9s)]
*  inches at this point in our season. So the relative humidity will continue to drop as we go throughout [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1625.14s)]
*  the rest of the afternoon and that's a problem because that will only help to spread fires more [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1630.74s)]
*  quickly because of the dry vegetation and low humidity on the ground. The other aspect in terms [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1636.18s)]
*  of the weather, the Santa Annas. This is a significant Santa Ana wind event. The National [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1641.38s)]
*  Weather Service has called this life-threatening in some instances. It's also said this is particularly [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1646.34s)]
*  dangerous. The third time they've used that type of language this season. So in terms of fires and [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1652.02s)]
*  the way fire spread, fires spread more rapidly uphill. You've got the rising heat from the flames [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1658.1s)]
*  rapidly preheating the fuel further up the slope causing it to ignite more quickly. So for every 10 [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1665.2199999999998s)]
*  degree of slope, it doubles the speed of the fire. The latest observation data specifically with the [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1671.86s)]
*  Palisades fire, we've got the Palisades winds gusting up to 12 miles per hour. Santa Monica [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1678.4199999999998s)]
*  Mountains, we've got gusts close to 50 miles per hour and the issue is that as we go throughout [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1683.94s)]
*  the rest of tonight, the winds are only going to intensify. The relative humidity is going to drop [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1689.06s)]
*  which will elevate the fire concern. Michael and Annabel. Much for that. We want to touch base now [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1694.26s)]
*  with NBC4's Alex Rosier. He's live. It's pretty crazy. Who are you with? What information do you [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1699.94s)]
*  have for us now? I don't know. I don't have IP. Hey guys, there's only been one time where I had [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1706.1799999999998s)]
*  to evacuate. There's only been one scene in this neighborhood. There's only one time where I've [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1714.34s)]
*  ever had to evacuate chat. And that was when I was with fish back in the day when I was living [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1719.3s)]
*  in Brentwood. I think it was like a fire that was in the vicinity, but it moved past us, [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1725.86s)]
*  but I still had to evacuate one time [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1732.66s)]
*  many, many years ago. And the way I evacuated was by going to work. Basically I went to work [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1736.98s)]
*  anyway, neighborhoods and it's starting to happen. This is Lachman and it's burned sort of around [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1746.26s)]
*  this Noel for some reason we're on a ridge, but it's burned down into Palisades drive down into [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1756.34s)]
*  that Canyon. And it's gone over to being Vanita down that Canyon. So there's that school, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1760.9s)]
*  St. Matthew's over there and Calvary on Palisades drive. Both I'm sure are evacuated. So schools [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1765.5400000000002s)]
*  and homes in a number of neighbors have already evacuated. What was how ironic a little bit ago, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1772.18s)]
*  someone saying the fog is fake. Now he's shaking his billionaire shoes in his $10 trillion house. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1777.6200000000001s)]
*  God is good. Hell yeah, baby. That's right. God is punishing me for questioning, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1782.66s)]
*  undermining the narrative of the fog. God was like, Oh yeah, you don't like the fog. Guess what, dude, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1788.74s)]
*  here I'm gonna give you, I'm gonna give you extra fog. This one is dark fog. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1795.86s)]
*  Our house down by the village and not this home on Lachman. It's been in the highlands. We lived [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1800.6599999999999s)]
*  there for a little while. It's been around, but it's never burned this area. As you stand here, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1807.06s)]
*  the wind's blowing the smoke around us. What's going through your mind? It's a strong wind. It's [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1811.78s)]
*  stronger than normal. So that's what drives the fire. There could be an ember a half mile away [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1817.54s)]
*  and it catches the wind and it lands over here and starts a whole new deal. I've seen several [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1824.1s)]
*  of them just start out out of nowhere. Like a big plume took off over to our right and it's like, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1827.78s)]
*  there goes another one. So if something like that were to land around us, we could put it out. That'd [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1833.46s)]
*  be great. But if not, we'll get out of here. Stewart, thank you for your time. Stay safe out [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1837.62s)]
*  there. I wish the best for you and your family and your neighborhood. I appreciate that. But [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1843.86s)]
*  we again are here at Lachman and Glen Haven watching this fast moving fire, the wind shifting in a [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1848.34s)]
*  variety of directions, smoke around us. And at many times we've seen flames on the hillside, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1854.9799999999998s)]
*  so close to several homes. Seems like a white neighborhood. Oh well, in general. Is this [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1861.06s)]
*  affecting poor people or rich people? Hopefully rich. Yeah, it's okay. It's cool if random people [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1866.26s)]
*  died, dude. And the police department who are held, this is the, this is the woke leftist version [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1872.66s)]
*  of what like liberals do all the time that I get really annoyed with whenever there's like a, a [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1877.7s)]
*  massive like hurricane or something impacting a massive hurricane impacting like a red state. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1882.5s)]
*  And they'll come in here and be like, well, they voted for this. I'm like, [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1890.5s)]
*  what do I have to do? Bludgeon you with the head with empathy? Like, how do we do this? [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1895.0600000000002s)]
*  Like I guess so annoyed. I guess so annoyed when liberals do this about like red States. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1899.06s)]
*  And I routinely yell at chat and it's the very same leftist who would probably get mad at liberals [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1910.8999999999999s)]
*  for saying that that turn around and go, Oh, it's awesome. Like this fire is not targeting the [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1918.5s)]
*  bourgeois. Okay. That's not how this works. What are you saying? Oh, I'm just glad that these are [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1923.06s)]
*  woke revolutionary fires that are doing permanent first world genocide. Like everyone is flammable. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1934.74s)]
*  Okay. Human beings are not, there is no, there is no extra protocol here. There's nothing [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1942.1s)]
*  like, it's not divine punishment for the, the class violence dished out by the bourgeois. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1948.34s)]
*  What are you guys saying? And don't come at me. Oh, it's just people. I'm the worst person to [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1962.6599999999999s)]
*  clap back against this. Cause everyone goes, it's because you're rich. You're a class enemy as well. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1970.98s)]
*  It's like, yes, you're right. I should be me and my whole family should die in a burning, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1976.02s)]
*  in a burning fire. Okay. For the crimes that I have committed, just like those random people as well. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1982.98s)]
*  And also just like the people in Florida deserve their untimely demise due to the hurricanes, [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=1992.58s)]
*  because they voted for it. They voted for the hurricanes. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2000.1s)]
*  The immortal spirit of Lenin rise on the burning horse of class struggle. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2006.98s)]
*  What is this? They wouldn't have empathy for you if the shoe was on the other foot. No, my point is [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2013.78s)]
*  like, this is, this is something that I get really annoyed by when people talk about with like [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2019.3s)]
*  Florida or North Carolina or like random places where there's like literally just [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2023.22s)]
*  chatters that live there and other liberals will come into the community and we'll just say some of [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2028.34s)]
*  the most annoying things, right? Like empathy is not supposed to be transactional and not only that, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2032.98s)]
*  but also it's just like, it's just like a silly thing to say. Most people will look at you like [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2039.62s)]
*  you're not a human being. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2049.94s)]
*  Yeah. It's very congested. And then you have a lot of cars and sometimes people will just leave the [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2058.34s)]
*  car right in the middle of the road. No danger. No off on the side of the curb that helps for [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2066.26s)]
*  access and egress. But again, this is why it's important to leave. Now you don't want to have [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2071.94s)]
*  this. We know this is coming. This is coming. So to the communities, to the West of this, [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2077.2200000000003s)]
*  that if you're in the path of this fire, why didn't these people leave earlier, brother? Do [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2081.94s)]
*  you know how fast a wildfire happens? Like this wasn't like hurricane warning for like, you know, [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2086.82s)]
*  five days or something. No, it literally happened in a span of 30 minutes. The fire started. I don't [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2096.7400000000002s)]
*  know if you know this. I don't know if you know this, but fires are very sudden. Okay. They are [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2105.6200000000003s)]
*  kind of notorious for being very Southern, very sudden, like, and, and depending on the wind gusts, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2113.14s)]
*  they can travel very quickly. No one, no one is like there's wildfire season in California, [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2122.2599999999998s)]
*  but even then no one is expecting it to happen. Sadly, you know, a lot of these homeowners are at [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2130.98s)]
*  a disadvantage because this fire broke out. Well, say you live up North without saying you live up [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2139.14s)]
*  North. No, I mean, there are, there are areas prone to wire wildfires for sure, but even then it's like [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2144.42s)]
*  quite difficult. It's quite difficult to get out of its way. What to do. In fact, you feel helpless [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2153.06s)]
*  at this point. Yeah, you do. And that's why we talked about this and you know, a lot as of lately [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2158.5s)]
*  prepare your home. Now think about before chatter has never heard the expression [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2165.3s)]
*  spreads like a wildfire. Yeah. I don't really understand. I don't know how that happened [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2169.7000000000003s)]
*  speaking of, you should probably have a go bag ready for everything. Okay. The thing is I live [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2177.94s)]
*  in the middle of one of the most densely slammed urban areas in Los Angeles. Okay. I'm in the middle [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2183.46s)]
*  of a city. Like this is the only area that is like closely resembling a city. I do not live [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2191.7s)]
*  around a forest. I do not live in the pathway of a brush fires. Like I'm good. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2197.2999999999997s)]
*  Obviously if there was any fire that was like any wind direction that was coming. Yeah. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2210.3399999999997s)]
*  If I, yeah, there's no leaving. If it comes to you, every highway will be slammed. Yeah. I'm cooked. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2217.22s)]
*  I'm cooked. It was first reported like two hours ago and since then over 200 acres of burn [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2221.7s)]
*  for chatters who need context. Yeah. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2232.58s)]
*  Dog, you literally have strong winds coming later today. No, we over we've already been having [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2240.2599999999998s)]
*  strong winds fire zones or an area that's prone to fire in Portugal trapped and killed 66 people [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2244.3399999999997s)]
*  trying to escape in literal cars. Welcome to the most critical during the Florida hurricane stream [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2249.94s)]
*  experience from chat. Yeah, but it's not even, if the fire is coming my way, I'm cooked literally [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2257.3s)]
*  and figuratively. Okay. Why is there no infrastructure for this? I don't, I don't fully know. I mean, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2270.02s)]
*  I guess like you can do your do a better job of depending on how this fire started, but like [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2279.54s)]
*  someone could just have thrown a cigarette bud. You know what I mean? Long duration, [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2284.5s)]
*  someone could have just straight up thrown a cigarette bud. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2290.74s)]
*  And as we're watching the images on the right of your screen, the firefighter tackle [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2298.02s)]
*  the flames of what looks like a structure or a gender reveal. Now you're dealing with [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2302.5s)]
*  flying embers in hot spots. So this is a concern and this is why we say erratic wind behavior [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2307.3s)]
*  because we're dealing with a specific fire. And on top of that fire, you've got flames that are [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2312.82s)]
*  burning in between those hot spots. You know, Melissa, you talk about these, you know, fire prone [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2318.42s)]
*  areas and how, you know, preparation and being proactive is key, but we're now seeing wind gusts [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2324.1000000000004s)]
*  in these wind sheltered areas. And we typically don't see winds like this in these areas. So [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2330.5800000000004s)]
*  those folks are now at risk to some degree. Exactly. So we're talking about areas like [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2335.86s)]
*  Altadena, Burbank, San Fernando Valley, Beverly Hills, areas in Pasadena that are typically not [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2341.54s)]
*  going to see a lot of these strong winds that we see through the canyons and passes, for example, [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2349.06s)]
*  the Cajon Pass, the Banning Pass. That's an area that you know is prone to seeing strong winds. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2354.1s)]
*  Same thing up across areas in the IE, up through Fontana, San Bernardino County, San Fernando Valley, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2359.3s)]
*  the Santa Clarita Valley. So this is why it's particularly stressful here in Southern California [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2365.22s)]
*  right now because you've got the winds and the wind will help to fuel the erratic behavior of the [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2371.54s)]
*  fire. You know, and I'm so glad that you're talking about how long this red flag warning is going to [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2379.14s)]
*  last. We've got it until 6 p.m. on Thursday. Right. So we're seeing these images, live images of the [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2384.02s)]
*  fire here. But this is a reminder for anybody else who lives elsewhere just to be ready to go as well [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2390.58s)]
*  because, yes, it's in this neighborhood right now, in the Pacific Palisades area, but it could very [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2396.8199999999997s)]
*  well go to the Inland Empire. We could be talking about the Inland Empire, God forbid, later on today, [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2401.62s)]
*  right? Or in the OC. I mean, we are talking about so many different areas that are affected by these [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2407.22s)]
*  gusts. Right. So the height of the wind gusts, Annabelle and Michael, that's going to be later [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2412.1s)]
*  on tonight and into your Wednesday. We'll have to wait and see if the National Weather Service [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2416.5s)]
*  extends any of these high wind warnings or wind watches that are posted here in Southern California, [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2420.82s)]
*  but that's where we're anticipating those strong winds, increased wind across our region. On top [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2425.54s)]
*  of that, even when the strongest winds exit Southern California, it is still going to be dry. So that's [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2432.82s)]
*  where that red flag warning comes in and that has been extended now until 6 p.m. on Thursday [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2439.54s)]
*  because of the Santa Ana's, because of the low relative humidity. This will certainly help to [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2445.62s)]
*  elevate and spread fires quickly and we're starting to see that this afternoon. I got one more question [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2452.3399999999997s)]
*  for you. You're working overtime over here. But yeah, you know, you mentioned earlier, and correct [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2457.7s)]
*  me if I'm wrong with this number here, but you said so far we should have at least experienced [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2464.9s)]
*  four inches of rain. Yes. And we have not. At least, and this is just for LA County. LA County, [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2470.66s)]
*  okay. Right. So we should see at least four inches of rain at this point in our water year. Our water [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2477.3799999999997s)]
*  year starts October 1st and it continues on. We've only seen a little bit more than a tenth of an inch [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2483.14s)]
*  of rain here in Los Angeles. So we've got a deficit specifically of 3.40 inches of rain. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2488.66s)]
*  The reason that is taking place is that all of the storms this season have been up across the Pacific [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2496.34s)]
*  Northwest. We've been talking about all of that rain and snow in Washington and Oregon and we're [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2501.46s)]
*  not seeing all any of that activity move down here in Southern California. All we need is one storm to [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2506.02s)]
*  change all of that. But as of now, it's been months, at least six months, where things have been dry [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2511.54s)]
*  here in LA County. All right. Unless as always, we're going to keep you on deck here. I'm here for you. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2517.3s)]
*  Thank you. We appreciate that. We want to bring in Chief Sam back here. Chief, Melissa was talking [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2524.5s)]
*  about this plan or this ready set go plan. What does that include? And we should probably talk [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2530.5s)]
*  about families, people who have families in scenarios like this. You leave for work, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2539.1400000000003s)]
*  you drop off the kids at school. They also, everybody needs to have a plan in the event of. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2544.98s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. And you have to practice that plan. Just like we drill with the fire department, [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2551.7799999999997s)]
*  just like exit drills in the home during fire safety in your home, you have to have a plan, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2558.5s)]
*  put it together, communicate it with your family members and practice it. But you know, the thing [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2564.42s)]
*  is, and sadly most people feel it will never happen to them. And it does honestly W rain, [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2570.82s)]
*  what rain bro? We don't got no rain. Do you have a plan? Yes. I'm going to get in my car and drive [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2578.9s)]
*  away. That's my plan. That is if you're not in the path of the fires, you stay home to leave the [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2585.38s)]
*  roads open for evacuees and emergency vehicles. Yeah. And by that, I'm in sit in the traffic [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2596.34s)]
*  until the flames erupt and kill me. Can you see from your house? No, I keep periodically going [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2603.46s)]
*  outside chat. It's wind patterns, wind patterns, wind patterns, wind direction has basically [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2615.2999999999997s)]
*  been pushing the fire towards the ocean. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2626.02s)]
*  I'm outside of the way of the fire. Technically it's like not that far away, but it might as [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2633.14s)]
*  well be in an entirely different planet. Like there is normally in previous wildfires, like [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2641.7799999999997s)]
*  in previous wildfires, like at least, you know, you can feel it in the air. Everything turns orange. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2650.2599999999998s)]
*  It's weird. None of that. It's clear right now is 70 degrees and sunny and clear in West Hollywood. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2657.3s)]
*  F the car. Don't you have a bike? No. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2668.5s)]
*  I do have, I do have motorcycles. I have my brother's motorcycles. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2673.78s)]
*  Technically I have a Triumph and a, a DRX. So if I wanted to, I just don't know how to bike, [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2680.42s)]
*  but if I wanted to, I have, I have the DRX that also has, I have a DRX with a saw kit in the back, [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2689.3s)]
*  like a electric with a, with a chainsaw on it. Cause Marat is a Sawyer as in he sometimes rides [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2698.1s)]
*  out and clears a brush and like debris from like, I guess he like volunteers to do stuff like that. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2706.9s)]
*  You have a DRX and color is of a socialist way. What a DRX. It's like, [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2713.22s)]
*  what am I saying? The wrong thing. It's like the entry-level dirt bike. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2720.18s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2722.98s)]
*  Have you been in a used car with, with a maroon. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2725.46s)]
*  You got this. I think I'm trying to hear Michael [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2727.86s)]
*  Am I saying the wrong thing? It's like the entry level dirt bike. What are you talking [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2734.52s)]
*  about? Maybe I'm saying the wrong thing. Isn't it? Sorry. I misunderstood. Yeah. It's yeah. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2739.84s)]
*  No it is. It's like a DRX, the entry level dirt bike chatter. It's a pretty sure it's [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2755.68s)]
*  like a, like, yeah, it's a $500 to a $1,000 dirt bike, but I might not have a DRX. It [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2762.9s)]
*  might, it might be a, it might be a DRZ maybe. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2777.46s)]
*  Cause I don't think it's a, it's a $1,000 dirt bike. I think it's more than that. I [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2779.9s)]
*  think it's like a $2,000. Yeah. It's a DRZ, which at its base, if you buy it new is seven [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2783.26s)]
*  grand. I'm pretty sure it's a DRZ, but they're also cheap. San Gabriel Valley just started [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2791.5s)]
*  getting hit with the winds. This was the biggest gust I've ever felt. And it shook my house. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2812.14s)]
*  It's expensive, dude. Also not mine. It's my brother's and he definitely is not wealthy. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2817.26s)]
*  So you're still like, it's just, my brother makes less money than half of the chatters [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2830.1800000000003s)]
*  in here. And he's like getting, he's getting pocket watched for a secondhand DRZ that he [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2838.14s)]
*  purchased for like four grand [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2847.38s)]
*  by extension. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2869.06s)]
*  He's also a fake socialist. All right. All right. Let's get back to Donald Trump as everything [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2870.06s)]
*  is on fire. Here's a house being burned up. That's crazy. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2876.7s)]
*  Make sure you take the stream back when you go, I'll be, we need that on the ground coverage. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2906.7s)]
*  Like friend of the show, storm chaser. Yeah. I I'm going to be honest with you chatters. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2916.66s)]
*  I don't think I'll be worrying about if it ever got to the point of like genuine evacuation [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2924.2999999999997s)]
*  necessity. I think for me it's, I think it's going to be past the point of streaming because [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2931.22s)]
*  like if I am, if I am in the middle of us in an evacuation zone, there is a much more [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2938.2999999999997s)]
*  dire situation at that point. We're talking like straight up like entire swaths of Los [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2946.7s)]
*  Angeles being lit on fire with tens of thousands of people dying. You understand? I can try [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2956.34s)]
*  to stream it, but I don't think the ISPs will be holding out at that point. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2966.54s)]
*  being in an evacuation zone is like, that's the big one telling you, dude, the pool would [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2977.02s)]
*  save your ass. So what do I do? Do I just, when the wildfires are happening, I just dive [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2988.58s)]
*  into my pool. I dive into my pool and boil like a crab. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhmR4bBo-wk&t=2993.06s)]
