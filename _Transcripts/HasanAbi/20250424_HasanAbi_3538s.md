# Interview With Arun Annow About What’s REALLY Happening In Kashmir
**HasanAbi:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk)
*  I think it was Kashmir Liberation Front or the Liberation Front or something like that. I forgot the acronym of it, but they basically [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=0.0s)]
*  They launched on [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=7.76s)]
*  These Indian tourists now the vast majority of them were Hindus [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=10.08s)]
*  Right. I think there was one Muslim guy that was trying to help [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=14.48s)]
*  the tourists basically escape from this [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=19.16s)]
*  All right, you know what let's I'm gonna talk to everyone now let's talk about India Pakistan [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=21.48s)]
*  I'm gonna hit him up right now. I'm gonna give him a call. What's up? Yo, can you hear me? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=27.02s)]

*  Oh, okay speak. Hello. Hello. Hello [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=43.480000000000004s)]

*  Yeah, I can see you [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=60.199999999999996s)]
*  What's up? Can chat see me? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=61.8s)]
*  Yes, let me pull up my thing on screen. All right. What's up everyone? How you doing? All right [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=64.72s)]
*  we [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=70.44s)]
*  India cancelling Pakistani visas freezing new applications in the aftermath of what happened in Kashmir with a ruin and all also known as [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=71.48s)]
*  Indian Hasan obvious he says but I'm the I'm the Turkish Arun [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=80.32000000000001s)]
*  Is the Turkish room that is correct? Yeah, he's also like six foot three, by the way, don't you know? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=84.80000000000001s)]
*  Don't let this camera angle fool you [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=90.12s)]
*  Yeah, we're basically almost the same height. Yeah, it's crazy [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=92.44s)]
*  People were like losing their mind when we actually met in person. They're like what the fuck Arun be this tall [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=96.72s)]
*  Yeah, it shocked me to my core as well. All right, so I [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  Have some I have some opinions like Kashmir [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=106.60000000000001s)]
*  That you know, I've talked about before [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=109.48s)]
*  I'm not the most knowledgeable on the situation. But from what I understand I remember there was a period of like a lot of [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=112.16s)]
*  censorship and and complete occupation from the Indian government. This is a [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=119.36s)]
*  territory that [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=123.84s)]
*  As far as I understand is predominantly Muslim [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=125.84s)]
*  But yeah, so is maintained at this moment in an occupational [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=129.52s)]
*  An occupation process by the Indian government and I remember them shutting off electricity [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=134.4s)]
*  Internet as well [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=140.60000000000002s)]
*  What's up? I'm pleading a shutdown. Yeah, complete shut down complete internet and electricity shut down as they [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=142.04000000000002s)]
*  greatly escalated escalated their occupation a couple years prior and [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=148.92000000000002s)]
*  And it's still it's still very much controlled from what I understand but like by [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=154.8s)]
*  figures sympathetic to India and like direct control [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=160.04s)]
*  Even though the population itself is is Muslim. Okay, so you basically hit the basics [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=163.52s)]
*  You're right. So it is currently under military occupation Kashmir is [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=170.4s)]
*  Kashmir is [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=175.0s)]
*  So we have to in order to actually understand Kashmir a little bit [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=176.64s)]
*  we have to it's a lot more diverse than people think it is because [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=180.04s)]
*  It's actually divided into several regions and it's administered controlled by different [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=184.08s)]
*  Parties so part of it is controlled by China part of it is controlled by [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=189.72s)]
*  obviously India and then part of is controlled by Pakistan and [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=193.72s)]
*  It's a very ethnically diverse region as well. So [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=197.08s)]
*  Most of the people that we're gonna be talking about today are Kashmiri like ethnically Kashmiri people [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=200.6s)]
*  But you know if you like those people live in the Kashmir Valley [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=206.56s)]
*  But if you go to Gilgit Baltistan you go to Ladakh which are different region regions of the overall Kashmir region [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=210.68s)]
*  they're going to be [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=216.76000000000002s)]
*  Basically the they're gonna be different ethnic groups, right? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=218.60000000000002s)]
*  But yes, you're generally right in that the majority of that region is Muslim. All right, the majority of that region is Muslim [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=221.84s)]
*  the most pressing region and that is the Kashmir Valley, which is basically [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=228.92000000000002s)]
*  Like Srinagar [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=234.48000000000002s)]
*  Belgam which we'll get to in a second but gum and and but I'm willing all these different but more than all these different cities in [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=236.64s)]
*  the Kashmir Valley and [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=242.2s)]
*  Yes, this is yes Kashmir is a type of cloth [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=243.79999999999998s)]
*  Guess where it gets its name that it comes from Kashmir. That's why it's it got its name because [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=247.79999999999998s)]
*  the average [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=253.72s)]
*  For a very long time and I don't know the specifics too much. But if I'm not mistaken [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=255.44s)]
*  For a long time the ethnic Kashmiri people [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=260.64s)]
*  Lived under different monarchies they lived under the Afghans. They lived under Mughals [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=264.15999999999997s)]
*  They lived under Sikhs as well and they were basically treated like shit for centuries [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=268.24s)]
*  they were basically for the longest time they were [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=273.48s)]
*  Basically serfs they were feudal peasants [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=278.2s)]
*  Basically slaves, right? So that's basically been their existence for several hundred years at this point. Mm-hmm [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=281.64s)]
*  And and the most recent like a lot of this conflict comes from the fact that at some point [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=288.2s)]
*  That Kashmir region that I'm talking about with majority Kashmiri people because she was speaking people [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=295.36s)]
*  they eventually fell under the [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=301.44s)]
*  the rule of the dogras now dogras are [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=304.44s)]
*  The majority they are the majority ethnic group of Jammu which and they were under the rule of Hari Singh [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=308.72s)]
*  Who were who is the who is the king of that region? So that's basically a general [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=315.28000000000003s)]
*  There's a distinct Kashmiri identity, which I want to hammer home right Kashmiri. A lot of Indians don't actually know this [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=322.08000000000004s)]
*  Kashmiris are an actual ethnic group. They just think oh Muslim this Muslim that right now [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=328.48s)]
*  Kashmiris are an actual ethnic group that are indigenous to that region [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=332.76000000000005s)]
*  Right. So they there's this weird misconception that like the Kashmiris are just Pakistani immigrants or whatever in India, which is bullshit [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=336.52000000000004s)]
*  It's complete nonsense. We also have Kashmiris in the chat say the wonka as well as a guy from Kashmir as well [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=344.08s)]
*  so that so [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=350.71999999999997s)]
*  Getting to what happened recently over the past two days [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=352.96s)]
*  You have a bunch of Indian tourists [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=357.44s)]
*  Visiting a city called Pahel gum at Rowan Davis my goat. He's a Arunano Indian [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=360.36s)]
*  Hassan Abhi certified [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=367.64s)]
*  He did a really good breakdown on what's going on here basically [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=370.0s)]
*  So in Pahel gum, which is a city in the Kashmir Valley [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=374.32s)]
*  There were a bunch of tourists now a there was a group. That's an offshoot called [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=378.88s)]
*  of an of a far-right militant organization called Leshkere Taiba [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=384.36s)]
*  I think it was Kashmir Liberation Front or the Liberation Front or something like that. I forgot the acronym of it, but they basically [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=388.32s)]
*  They launched on these Indian tourists now the vast majority of them were Hindus [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=395.56s)]
*  Right. I think there was one Muslim guy that was trying to help [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=402.64s)]
*  The tourists basically escaped from this and the long story short. He was also killed. It's called the resistance front [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=407.28s)]
*  That's the name of the militant group that that actually attacked those tourists. There is now there was a lot of misinformation that was spreading about this [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=415.12s)]
*  Initially as is expected as is expected but one thing that I [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=422.8s)]
*  saw that I wanted to ask you if there's veracity to this is like they were [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=428.72s)]
*  Trying to make sure that they were only Hindus or something like that was or is that just like [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=433.04s)]
*  Israel style commentary on the situation to [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=440.24s)]
*  Stoke racial tensions or is that is there any veracity to that? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=443.84000000000003s)]
*  So the the thing is a lot of the [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=448.32s)]
*  Militant groups. I think the vast majority of militant groups in Kashmir are at this point are far-right Muslim fundamentalists at this point [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=452.08s)]
*  so [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=459.84s)]
*  There's again. I haven't been able to comb through whether that's actually true or not, but there may be a [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=461.03999999999996s)]
*  They're far-right extremists. They're far-right Muslim fundamentalists at this point including these guys [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=468.15999999999997s)]
*  Right, so there's probably some element of truth in that they were specifically seeking out [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=473.12s)]
*  Hindu tourists probably but at the same time [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=479.28000000000003s)]
*  At the same time like the immediate reaction from Kashmiris themselves Kashmiri Muslims, by the way was a complete and utter condemnation [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=484.32s)]
*  Is a complete and utter condemnation [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=494.56s)]
*  on [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=497.44s)]
*  Like the actual actual actual actual actual actual actual actual actual actual actual [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=498.96s)]
*  so [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=503.44s)]
*  Immediately like again the whether that's true or not is irrelevant to the point because Kashmir is immediately in the wake of that [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=504.62s)]
*  Uh completely condemned it entirely [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=512.4s)]
*  um, and and at the same time [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=515.52s)]
*  They they immediately said we have nothing to do with this so on and so forth [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=519.2s)]
*  Right, so that that is a completely moot point. Okay [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=524.24s)]
*  um [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=527.92s)]
*  So from what I understand and I I guess this is what rohan is saying as well, which is that [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=528.96s)]
*  This is a direct byproduct of colonial occupation or not colonial occupation, but just like military occupation over a region [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=534.88s)]
*  that has a different ethnicity and wants autonomy [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=542.48s)]
*  whether that is [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=546.72s)]
*  led by more fundamentalist elements that [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=548.5600000000001s)]
*  Have that have gotten training [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=552.0s)]
*  Uh as a direct consequence of of actions that america, uh played in the region and then this destabilization or this [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=554.8s)]
*  allowed [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=562.96s)]
*  groups like the one we're talking about right now to [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=564.48s)]
*  To take control over the liberation movement [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=568.4s)]
*  and and move it in whichever direction to say like maybe they want to [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=572.4s)]
*  Align with pakistan or whatever doesn't necessarily matter, but it's a direct byproduct of of [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=576.16s)]
*  Uh a settler colonial military occupation over the region, right? Yeah, so yes, so like [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=582.5600000000001s)]
*  Whatever the like obviously the [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=590.4s)]
*  Okay [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=593.6s)]
*  I'm gonna make one thing perfectly clear for chat. Obviously thing was horrific. There is no [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=595.28s)]
*  The killing of innocent civilians is absolutely horrific [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=600.64s)]
*  There's nothing that justifies that kashmiris will tell you literally literally they literally protested [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=603.9200000000001s)]
*  Uh, or they literally did a demonstration [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=610.5600000000001s)]
*  So obviously like i'm not justifying any killing. Okay, shut the fuck up chat second of all [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=613.6s)]
*  the [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=620.5600000000001s)]
*  The you're right. It is it is out and about a [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=621.6s)]
*  military [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=625.5s)]
*  Uh, it is a military occupation [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=627.52s)]
*  and i'm gonna talk about one thing i'm gonna talk about a very similar conflict in this because there's a [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=630.48s)]
*  Uh another liberation struggle here because that plays [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=636.8s)]
*  It's very similar and there's a connection here [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=641.44s)]
*  It's the elam liberation struggle in in in in elam the tamil liberation struggle in elam [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=643.44s)]
*  So those two are actually quite connected here because the indian army is involved in in in both [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=649.92s)]
*  instances [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=656.14s)]
*  Right. So i'm but a lot of the stuff that the indian army is doing in kashmir [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=657.28s)]
*  Is very similar to what the srilankan government has been doing to tamils and also quite similar to what the indian government has been doing to tamils [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=661.8399999999999s)]
*  In in elam as well [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=669.36s)]
*  Right, so there's very stark similarities has been enforced disappearances [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=671.36s)]
*  uh mass uh trigger warning sexual assaults mass rapes here [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=676.7199999999999s)]
*  um the indian what the indian government has been doing to the kashmiri people for decades is [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=681.5999999999999s)]
*  genuinely horrific [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=686.6999999999999s)]
*  and this is [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=688.7199999999999s)]
*  Uh, there's a there's a podcast [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=690.4s)]
*  named after this phenomenon [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=693.04s)]
*  um where if you oppress a group of people long enough [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=695.28s)]
*  There's something [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=699.76s)]
*  That is eventually going to come [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=701.52s)]
*  back at you [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=703.84s)]
*  and you know [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=705.4399999999999s)]
*  Blow in a particular way, you know what I mean? There's a yeah, I know it's a crazy phenomenon, right? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=706.88s)]
*  Yeah, uh, this is a what we're seeing here is a perfect example of blowback what we're seeing is [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=712.48s)]
*  Decades and decades and decades [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=719.04s)]
*  Again, this is not justification. This is an observation of what is actually happening, right? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=722.48s)]
*  so [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=727.6800000000001s)]
*  What is what is going on here is that we are seeing decades upon decades upon decades of oppression of the kashmiri people [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=728.8s)]
*  by the indian state [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=736.0s)]
*  right and and [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=737.92s)]
*  Uh forced militarization again kashmir is one of the most militarized region is the most militarized region in the world [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=739.92s)]
*  Um on top of that [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=746.8s)]
*  uh the [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=748.8s)]
*  On on top of that. Uh, yeah, basically you have the general gist of what's going on here [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=750.4s)]
*  It is a complete military occupation. There are military checkpoints [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=755.36s)]
*  there have been things such as the my uh, the mass blinding campaign of kashmiris where [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=758.8s)]
*  When kashmiris would go into the streets and protest [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=764.24s)]
*  Uh for their liberation or for their independence or whatever [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=767.52s)]
*  They would directly get attacked [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=771.68s)]
*  Attacked by the indian military [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=774.2399999999999s)]
*  And they would get rubber pellets shot into their eyes and they would be permanently blinded by the indian state the mass [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=776.56s)]
*  What blinding campaign? Yes, there's a there's a thing about [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=781.1999999999999s)]
*  There's been a massive situation where uh, the indian government has been engaging in [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=784.9599999999999s)]
*  mass blinding campaigns of kashmiris, okay, so [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=790.0799999999999s)]
*  uh, so this this uh [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=794.0s)]
*  attack takes place [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=796.16s)]
*  And the indian government springs into action, uh, what are the events that unfolded since then? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=798.4s)]
*  From what I understand the case of pakistani visas froze new applications and perhaps even more consequentially more significantly [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=804.9599999999999s)]
*  Uh, they are revoking the indus waters treaty [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=812.7199999999999s)]
*  From what I understand pakistan has deemed india's suspension of the indus water treaty an act of war [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=816.0s)]
*  Found the deadly tourist tag in kashmir's balgam. Here's what you need to know about india's indus water treaty freeze [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=821.28s)]
*  This uh shuts off waterways in pakistan [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=827.4399999999999s)]
*  because india is saying that the uh, the the militant formations [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=830.8s)]
*  Only happened under the watchful eye of of pakistan, right? Like that's what they're saying [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=835.5999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so india is basically saying they're they've they've revoked the indus waters treaty treaty [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=840.4s)]
*  They're trying to freeze water into pakistan [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=845.68s)]
*  Which is I this is idiotic red meat that modi is throwing at his base [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=848.24s)]
*  Uh, that's what this entire [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=854.3199999999999s)]
*  The that is the entire like that is basically what mo uh modi said and this is this entire thing about [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=857.04s)]
*  uh, you know blocking water going into pakistan is completely stupid because [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=863.68s)]
*  Uh as many in india have already pointed out [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=868.3199999999999s)]
*  In order for that to happen india has to build a dam. Oh, they don't even oh they they don't even have a way to damn it [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=871.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, oh, I just thought there was at least the water damn [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=877.76s)]
*  Yeah, they need a dam to actually block the water so they literally just said hey [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=882.0s)]
*  No, we're gonna block water going into pakistan and this is literally just ready like he just said yeah [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=886.16s)]
*  We're just gonna block water going from uh going to pakistan [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=890.9599999999999s)]
*  The entire thing is just him posturing on the situation. That's it. This is so like literally just like yeah [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=893.68s)]
*  This is such a trump move dude modi and trump [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=899.5999999999999s)]
*  um incredible allies yeah it is [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=903.12s)]
*  You haven't seen uh some of his speeches in hindi. That's why he's uh [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=907.04s)]
*  That's what like he's he says some really, uh [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=911.1999999999999s)]
*  unhinged shit [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=914.88s)]
*  uh in in hindi, that's why I mean I don't speak hindi and I probably never will but [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=916.48s)]
*  Okay, please highlight how the upturning of the autonomy of jjk led to this. Yes. So again, the other main accelerant is [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=921.52s)]
*  so by by 2019 at that point, I mean the the special protections that uh jamun kashmir had [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=928.48s)]
*  Up until that very point had already basically been hollowed out any sort of special protections that [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=935.36s)]
*  jnk might have had that kashmir might have had were already hollowed out by [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=940.4s)]
*  the uh [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=945.04s)]
*  By the by the congress government at that point [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=946.4s)]
*  And congress had already been using uh [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=949.68s)]
*  They already had laws in the books like uapa [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=952.7199999999999s)]
*  like uh [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=955.4399999999999s)]
*  Unlawful activities prevention act and especially armed forces special powers act which they'd actually deployed in the northeastern parts of india, which is nagaland [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=956.9599999999999s)]
*  Uh mizoram so on and so forth long before they'd actually started doing this in kashmir as well [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=966.1s)]
*  so basically the long story short is that uh, they have [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=971.62s)]
*  At that point kashmiri's autonomy had already been eroded whatever autonomy they made if they they might have had [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=976.34s)]
*  but in 2019, uh india basically [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=982.82s)]
*  Modi's government basically revoked article 370 [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=986.02s)]
*  which was the [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=989.86s)]
*  Constitutional article that gave kashmir these special protections as a part of the instrument of accession to india that haris Singh signed [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=991.76s)]
*  right [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=999.76s)]
*  and so [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1000.8s)]
*  What had happened then is that modi modi's administration basically said you no longer are a state [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1002.24s)]
*  we are going to [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1009.4399999999999s)]
*  split the region [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1011.2s)]
*  One side is going to be the residual part of jamun kashmir [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1013.28s)]
*  and the other part is now ladakh ladakh is a [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1017.68s)]
*  Um ladakh is a separate union territory. So they're both union territories [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1021.76s)]
*  And they were governed a separate unit. They were still governed a separate union territories and for about five years from 2019 [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1026.08s)]
*  Uh, they had no local authority. They had no chief minister [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1033.44s)]
*  So they were directly ruled by delhi [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1038.8s)]
*  Now the current ruler [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1043.04s)]
*  Uh omar abdullah [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1045.36s)]
*  Uh is generally despised by the kashmiri community [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1047.44s)]
*  Seems like a pa style [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1050.88s)]
*  it is versus hamas style situation not to bring it back to israel, but [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1053.2s)]
*  No, no, no, no, because here's okay. So israel [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1057.76s)]
*  India and then i'm going to bring this up again sri lanka [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1061.92s)]
*  india sri lanka [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1064.96s)]
*  Very similar in their rhetoric [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1066.48s)]
*  very similar in their actions [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1068.64s)]
*  Very similar in what they're actually doing [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1070.88s)]
*  Right, it's and also pakistan kind of plays a role in this as well because again what they're doing in balochistan is [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1074.0s)]
*  In many ways very similar what bangladesh is doing in cht. Chittagong hill tracks is also very similar to this [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1079.1200000000001s)]
*  right [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1085.68s)]
*  There's a lot of uh occupation and settler colonization that is happening in the subcontinent [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1086.96s)]
*  Right, so this is like this is by no mean. This is one of the things I want to impress upon the audience [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1093.6000000000001s)]
*  What you're seeing on [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1099.2800000000002s)]
*  What you're seeing on what you're seeing in gaza what you're seeing in west bank. That's not unique [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1101.5200000000002s)]
*  Is not unique at all [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1106.72s)]
*  Many other countries are doing this. Yeah, right [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1108.32s)]
*  The the reason that you're seeing what's the reason that israel gets a lot of attention is colonial occupation always [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1111.2s)]
*  Always applies very similar methods of dividing and conquering and creating bantustan style structures as well [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1117.76s)]
*  whether it be in south africa and apartheid south africa or [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1123.76s)]
*  Or whether it be the way that these uh nation states were designed by european powers in the aftermath of world war one [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1126.96s)]
*  In the region directly [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1134.0s)]
*  Yes, and as a nerd that was promised says kashmiris have masked have faced mass killings force [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1136.1599999999999s)]
*  Disappearances rapes murders torture and a west bank style checkpoint regime from the indian military as you know tamils and elam have [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1141.82s)]
*  Uh as well, so it's again. It's all very connected with one another [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1150.08s)]
*  Um, it's it's it's very a lot of the stuff that i've [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1153.9199999999998s)]
*  Especially seen coming out of late. It's very reminiscent of what i've seen in sri lanka previously in elam [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1157.1999999999998s)]
*  uh previously, um [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1163.3600000000001s)]
*  so yes as as far as the waters treaty is concerned this is [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1165.28s)]
*  Uh, basically just a move to posture against uh, uh, kash, you know pakistan [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1170.32s)]
*  Now the thing is the the biggest indication of how pakistan is taking it is [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1176.16s)]
*  Uh pakistani twitter is memeing about the entire thing [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1181.44s)]
*  They're just relaxing and they're memeing about [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1184.8s)]
*  Uh, it's that it's like that. Uh, it's like that 50 cent meme where he's like, fuck me [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1187.68s)]
*  What'd you say fuck me for? [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1193.2s)]
*  Right there. They're just casually memeing on on twitter causal connection here from india's side for whether it's propaganda or if there's any truth to it or not [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1195.28s)]
*  Is is the fact that they're claiming that the uh resistance front that you're talking about is backed by the pakistani government [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1204.4s)]
*  Yes, they are the pakistani military, right? That's what they're trying to say. Yeah. Yeah [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1212.0s)]
*  So pakistan is backing the pakistani they are opportunistically backing the kashmiri militants [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1215.76s)]
*  uh, because again [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1222.8s)]
*  Pakistan doesn't actually care about kashmir either right? Let's just make that abundantly clear kashmiris will tell you this themselves [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1224.8600000000001s)]
*  pakistan does not actually [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1230.94s)]
*  Give a flying fuck about the kashmiri people in general. They do not give a shit [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1232.64s)]
*  Right. It's it is for many, uh for many people in pakistan. It is just a way of [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1238.0s)]
*  It's the same way that india weaponizes balochistan against pakistan. It's not dissimilar to like iran almost [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1243.1200000000001s)]
*  Exactly, okay. Sorry i'm eating so I was just seeing for you [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1250.16s)]
*  No, I was just uh [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1256.16s)]
*  Well, yeah, that's basically uh what's going on and now uh, so after after all that what's been happening so far [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1257.68s)]
*  So some of the immediate backlash [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1264.8s)]
*  uh as a result of this [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1267.6000000000001s)]
*  so some of the immediate, uh, uh [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1270.32s)]
*  so some of the immediate backlash of this [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1272.64s)]
*  is that uh [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1275.76s)]

*  Uh, let me see if I can find one of these things immediately. I have one right here [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1319.9199999999998s)]
*  Hold on i'm gonna pull it up. Is this hindu on campus tweet? [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1323.28s)]

*  Okay, so [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1337.76s)]
*  quick inside baseball i've gotten into twitter beefs with this guy with these guys before because [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1339.2s)]

*  One thing i've one thing that you'll notice immediately out of the gate [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1355.44s)]
*  Is that they will talk about hindu genocide this hindu genocide that hindu genocide this hindu genocide that but again [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1359.76s)]
*  Sorry to bring this up again [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1366.56s)]
*  But one great example of a hindu majority ethnic group [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1368.64s)]
*  That was straight up slaughtered and massacred en masse by a another country [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1372.64s)]
*  That these guys seem to be very silent about tamils [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1379.28s)]
*  Yeah, tamils are elam tamils. They're a they're a hindu majority ethnic group [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1383.12s)]
*  That were directly slaughtered [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1389.04s)]
*  By the shri lankan government whose temples are being destroyed by the shri lankan singhalese buddhist nationalist government [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1391.6s)]
*  They never mention elam elam never gets into their mouth [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1399.28s)]
*  Isn't that interesting now the reason they don't ever they don't ever point out [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1403.12s)]
*  Elam they don't ever mention uh tamils at all is because they cannot spin it as hindu as this civil civilizational conflict [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1408.3999999999999s)]
*  between islam [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1417.12s)]
*  like muslims wait [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1418.6399999999999s)]
*  I I lost your voice there. I we can't hear you anymore. I don't know what happened. Wait, I [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1420.7199999999998s)]

*  Okay, so the reason is the reason they don't mention elam or or shri lanka at all is because they cannot pin this on [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1431.84s)]
*  Uh muslims whatsoever. They can't put they cannot pin this on islam, but now they're immediately [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1439.1999999999998s)]
*  Again and a lot of the talking points that you're seeing immediately you will immediately see that they're very similar to zionists. They're [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1445.52s)]
*  They're immediately similar to zionists. You will see what they're saying immediately and it's it you will see the [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1452.2199999999998s)]

*  Almost zionist talking points that you're hearing here. Well, the one thing I heard was [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1461.6s)]
*  the one thing I saw was a dude being like [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1466.4799999999998s)]
*  No, the only place where hindus are free [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1469.76s)]

*  Yeah, it is a lot of these talking points are straight [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1491.28s)]
*  They're extremely similar to hasbro 100 percent [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1494.8s)]
*  They're extremely similar to hasbro that a lot of these talking points will sound like hasbro because it is very similar. These are [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1498.6399999999999s)]
*  These are [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1506.08s)]
*  Again, these are talking points specifically used to justify horrific crimes [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1508.2399999999998s)]
*  done by the indian state against kashmiri, uh civilians against kashmiris [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1514.1599999999999s)]

*  Uh that that kashmiris have had to deal with for a very long time [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1544.48s)]

*  I mean and this will it seems like this will also be used as [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1713.3600000000001s)]
*  An opportunity to to bring in the ranks and and instill more racial tension or instill more ethnic tension [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1718.0s)]
*  Yeah, and justify atrocities towards not only the kashmiri population but muslims as a whole, right? [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1726.4s)]
*  Yes already already we actually see uh, there's a report out I think today where [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1732.88s)]
*  1500 kashmiris [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1739.74s)]
*  Were literally just rounded up by the police and disappeared [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1741.76s)]
*  There was a report out today where 1500 of kashmiris were in the wake of this [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1745.92s)]
*  They were rounded up by the the kashmiri state. Sorry by the indian state some aged at uh, [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1751.68s)]
*  14 it said [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1758.54s)]
*  On this tweet 7,000 kashmiris muslims have been arrested by indian intellectuals [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1760.4s)]
*  This is morning and taken to unknown locations youngsters from 14 years old to 30 years old. I don't know if this is [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1764.24s)]
*  Correct or not, uh, I don't know what the exact number on that is the kashmiri journalists, uh is saying that it is 1500 [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1769.1999999999998s)]
*  So this is what i'm seeing i'm seeing it off of kashmiri journal [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1778.56s)]
*  Uh 1,500 kashmiris, uh are our dates so far again. This is adding to the uh again. This is adding to the [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1782.0s)]
*  Uh, the the mass and forced disappearances that the indian state has been engaging in against [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1790.6399999999999s)]
*  Uh kashmiris as well [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1795.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, they have a west bank style like torture disappearance, uh [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1798.0s)]
*  Regime as well from what I understand [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1803.76s)]
*  Yes, they do. It is again a lot of things that you're seeing in kashmir is going to be very similar to what you've been seeing [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1806.3200000000002s)]
*  Especially I mean all of the conflicts that i've mentioned thus far, right? [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1813.6000000000001s)]
*  Uh is going to be very similar to uh, what you're seeing in in in the west bank [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1817.76s)]
*  Um, yeah, i'm gonna hammer home if you're not in india [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1823.2s)]
*  Please stop yelling at indian leftists for not saying some certain things openly the pro-occupation propaganda runs very deep and most indians don't have to get [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1826.24s)]
*  Uh, that is another thing I do want to mention [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1832.3200000000002s)]
*  Uh, so you're from I mean obviously you're from turkey, right? So [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1835.0400000000002s)]
*  Uh, you're turkish shiroun obviously so there are some things in turkey [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1839.1200000000001s)]
*  That you're probably familiar with that. You cannot talk about openly no like the armenian genocide [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1843.44s)]
*  Armenian genocide is a great example. I think you cannot openly voice your support for uh, an independent kyrgyzstan in turkey [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1848.5600000000002s)]
*  Right. Yeah, I mean you can but you'll get uh penalized for it [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1856.64s)]
*  Yeah, you you could be there's it's the same repercussions for it [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1860.48s)]
*  Yes, it's the same thing here. You can very easily get swept up by the police if you are not even if you're not a [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1864.64s)]
*  Kashmiri person. I mean if you're kashmiri person you're already like [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1871.28s)]
*  Under strict surveillance you are constantly under uh [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1874.72s)]
*  If you're living in kashmir you're under strict surveillance you're living in [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1878.88s)]
*  basically, uh military occupation [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1883.2s)]
*  If you live outside of kashmir and you live in mainland india, you are also probably going to be surveilled as well [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1886.0s)]
*  So you also cannot be open and honest about your opinions on [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1892.4s)]
*  On your self-determination on top of that, but even if you're not, uh from kashmir it is a very [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1896.16s)]
*  This is one of those issues. This is one of two issues [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1904.8s)]
*  in india that you cannot, you know openly voice your opinion on just and on top of that so it's not just the [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1908.16s)]
*  um [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1915.68s)]
*  The other thing to keep in mind is it's not just the hindu nationalists on here that are like immediately [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1916.64s)]
*  Uh, you know bloodthirsty in the result in the wake of this [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1922.24s)]
*  Indian liberals are also very bloodthirsty at the moment and even uh, vivet vijay prashad [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1926.32s)]
*  Uh, who is a member of the communist party of india marxist? [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1933.7s)]
*  um [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1937.54s)]
*  the cpim [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1938.5s)]
*  Recently made a statement [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1940.18s)]
*  um, and and I didn't read the full statement, uh, if or at least I don't remember the full statement that he said [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1942.42s)]
*  Not vijay, uh not vivik vijay prashad. Uh, he made a statement regarding the the attacks [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1949.06s)]
*  Which you could basically amount to a sort of labor zionist talking point [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1955.78s)]
*  Um because the cpim one of the [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1960.98s)]
*  Again, one of the two issues that they suck on is kashmir [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1963.54s)]
*  And the other issue that they suck on is that they're really bad on is elam again. They they several decades earlier [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1967.22s)]
*  uh, they [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1976.1000000000001s)]
*  Threw out members of their own party for opposing the indian army [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1978.02s)]
*  entering elam [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1982.1000000000001s)]
*  currently occupied by sri lanka and [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1984.1000000000001s)]
*  Basically mass raping tamils and going to hospitals and shooting them dead basically [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1987.06s)]
*  Um, so yeah cpim, uh is all yes. This is the statement someone linked it in the chat. Thank you [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1992.6599999999999s)]
*  uh [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1998.8999999999999s)]
*  Vijay prashad also made a statement [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=1999.78s)]
*  uh, which is [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2002.4199999999998s)]
*  Again, it's very reminiscent. It's very reminiscent than what it's very [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2004.4199999999998s)]
*  reminiscent of what you would expect from a labor zionist basically and and that's basically how a lot of uh, [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2009.28s)]
*  Communist parties in this region generally operate the moment you turn the moment you start talking about self-determination struggles. That's when uh, they immediately [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2015.3s)]
*  They immediately, uh [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2025.78s)]
*  They immediately, uh [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2028.98s)]
*  Turn they basically uh a waffle a lot more basically by the way am I making sense? [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2030.98s)]
*  Yeah [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2036.58s)]
*  No, absolutely. I think there's a great analog [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2037.3799999999999s)]
*  At kashmir surely can't be land like it is with israel. No, it literally is the land actually [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2040.74s)]
*  Uh kashmir is is the source of water for both pakistan and india. It is land. That is the reason [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2045.06s)]
*  All of a lot of these conflicts are all about land. Uh, the same thing with again elam, uh, elam is in the middle of uh, uh, [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2050.74s)]
*  Sri lanka is in the middle of the indian ocean [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2058.66s)]
*  Uh, it has it is home to a deep sea port trincomalee [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2061.38s)]
*  Meaning you can stick any ship you want there. It's it's vital for trade. That's why [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2064.9s)]
*  in a very similar fashion to [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2069.46s)]
*  Uh the the kashmiri militants and in the kashmiri self-determination struggle [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2072.02s)]
*  Has been uh violently quelched by the state. Um, so what do you suspect? Uh [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2076.34s)]
*  Will happen like what do you where where do you think this is going to go? Uh, where do I think this is going to go immediately? [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2083.38s)]
*  so [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2089.7s)]
*  Uh, I mean the immediate aftermath of what's going to happen is so anyone that's saying that indian pakistan are going to war [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2090.58s)]
*  That's immediately not true. That's that's a silly thing [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2095.46s)]
*  Um, because both india and pakistan [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2099.06s)]
*  Are nuclear armed countries. They're both nuke. They have nukes. So [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2102.42s)]
*  Maybe both of those cool border. They'll do the cool border crossing, uh ceremony [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2108.18s)]
*  Probably. I mean they already do that already. I love that shit. This shit is dope as hell [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2113.7s)]
*  No, but what's what's already happening? It's not what's gonna happen. What is already happening is like I mentioned [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2118.82s)]
*  Uh, there's gonna be increased crackdowns on on kashmiri's living in kashmir itself and outside of [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2124.02s)]
*  kashmir in mainland india [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2131.54s)]
*  Uh, and on top of that, uh, what is going I mean we again? [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2133.86s)]
*  Uh, this is going to further accelerate the settler colonialism that india has been engaging in uh settler colonialism that india has been engaging in [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2138.42s)]
*  for the past [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2147.94s)]
*  Several decades or so against kashmiris again, uh, there was a report earlier today [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2149.54s)]
*  uh, I think [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2155.38s)]
*  Uh, there was a there was a report earlier today of kashmiris basically being chased I think [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2158.1s)]
*  Uh in Chandigarh if I can find uh that tweet i'll send it to you [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2164.42s)]
*  uh, there's a report of [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2168.34s)]
*  Kashmiris or of kashmiri students being chased out [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2170.18s)]
*  Um of of their homes and and they're basically being forced out, uh by the local [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2174.7400000000002s)]
*  People that they're living next to basically so pogroms [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2181.06s)]
*  Pogroms. Yes. Yeah [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2185.94s)]
*  Very like what we're probably going to see unfortunately is potentially, uh a pogrom [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2188.26s)]
*  Well, the conflict only get worse with climate change affecting water access probably [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2194.1s)]
*  Indi will clamp down on freedom in kashmir. I don't know if there'll be an invasion because kashmir is literally the most militarized region in the world [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2198.1s)]
*  Cannot play invade a place that is already militarized. Yes [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2204.74s)]
*  Uh, yes, so yeah, there's a lot already invaded a question that a lot of chatters have in speaking to their uh friends [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2209.06s)]
*  They're saying that a lot of liberals around them living in the united states of america basically turned into like hindutva fascists [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2217.7s)]
*  Um overnight in the aftermath of this like is there any way to [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2224.58s)]
*  Is there any way to talk to them? [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2229.22s)]
*  Sending them rohan's video is a great start actually not gonna lie to help them develop a better understanding of like how these things [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2231.62s)]
*  transpired [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2238.72s)]
*  Yeah, i'm not gonna lie. I think rohan davis is a great start. Uh, his videos are directly aimed at the indian diaspora [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2240.3399999999997s)]
*  Uh, he is a very progressive [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2247.38s)]
*  indian [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2249.7799999999997s)]
*  citizen [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2251.14s)]
*  Uh, and he is basically aiming his videos all at at the indian diaspora. So his videos can help a lot I think [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2252.5s)]
*  um [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2261.3s)]
*  As far as that's concerned [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2262.82s)]
*  The only thing that you can really do is you have to really educate yourself on the region [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2265.62s)]
*  So you have to really educate yourself on what's going on in kashmir and you have to be able to strike down those talking points [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2272.1s)]
*  Because they're already like obviously, you know, they're going to have [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2279.1400000000003s)]
*  certain, uh, uh send them to indian leftist dreamers who are already part of the hasanabi community [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2283.38s)]
*  um, what are what are some of the talking points, um that they're addressing I wanted to [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2289.06s)]
*  One major talking point that they'll immediately bring up when you mention kashmir is the kashmiri pundits [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2294.5s)]
*  The exodus of the kashmiri pundits that is the immediate thing that they'll bring up [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2302.6600000000003s)]
*  um [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2307.2200000000003s)]
*  because uh [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2308.1000000000004s)]
*  So the kashmiri pundits [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2309.7000000000003s)]
*  Uh, if you don't know are so kashmiris are a majority muslim ethnic group [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2312.1000000000004s)]
*  But there's a tiny minority of kashmiris that are uh hindus and the majority of those of those kashmiri hindus [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2317.38s)]
*  Uh are pundits. They're brahmins. They're upper castes, right? [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2325.38s)]
*  now, uh [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2329.86s)]
*  the immediate [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2331.6200000000003s)]
*  Aftermath of that so what happened was in the 90s [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2333.38s)]
*  Uh, there was already a a exodus of kashmiri hindus living, uh leaving kashmir already [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2337.54s)]
*  But what accelerated that? [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2344.6600000000003s)]
*  was uh [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2346.82s)]
*  What had accelerated that was attacks from again far-right? [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2348.42s)]
*  Uh fundamentalist militants [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2352.9s)]
*  And they had eventually, uh, uh, they were basically forced out [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2355.38s)]
*  now there are a couple of things that uh [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2359.78s)]
*  They can uh [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2362.5s)]
*  There's there's a couple of ways of combating that talking point because one [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2364.26s)]
*  Uh, the modi administration has been using the kashmiri pundits [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2368.02s)]
*  uh as uh [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2373.0600000000004s)]
*  Also, yes. Another thing that mohammed mentioned is that there's a local asam mla [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2374.9s)]
*  He's a hindu guy, by the way, who was literally arrested by the indian government [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2379.6200000000003s)]
*  Uh for questioning the government's lack of intelligence on the attacks [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2384.34s)]
*  Because another thing that uh india was saying up until this very point was no the revocation of article 370 which turned jnk in jammu [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2388.5s)]
*  Kashmir into a union territory [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2396.66s)]
*  After turning it into a military to a union territory. Everything's fine. Everyone was happily going to [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2399.7s)]
*  Uh jammu and kashmir, uh, you know, there's nothing wrong [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2406.42s)]
*  Pakistan that is literally [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2410.58s)]
*  Oh, I lost you again your mic got [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2412.1s)]
*  Your mic got cut off again. No, I can't hear you. Uh [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2414.74s)]
*  Can you hear me your mic got cut off? [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2418.82s)]
*  Oh, it's back for a second. Wait speak again [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2422.66s)]
*  Yeah, my mic is I just got a new mic. I'm getting it. Okay. Yeah, you're back [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2426.98s)]
*  I i'm gonna get a road caster. I promise i'm gonna fix my mic setup, uh, all right [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2432.18s)]
*  so, uh, but long story short, uh, [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2437.22s)]
*  uh [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2441.3s)]
*  What was I saying? I was talking about the kashmiri pundits, right? [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2442.66s)]
*  So obviously yes, or he's a muslim mla from a uh, uh muslim party. Okay, so [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2445.54s)]
*  Obviously what happened to the kashmiri pundits is is a horrific tragedy. There's no question about it [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2452.1s)]
*  right [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2457.8599999999997s)]
*  um [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2458.74s)]
*  and and the long story short is that [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2459.9399999999996s)]
*  They india has been engaging in decades of military occupation yet till this day the kashmiri pundits have not been able to return home [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2463.62s)]
*  Modi has been in power for 10 years [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2471.2999999999997s)]
*  When you were saying pundit, I thought you meant like [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2473.6200000000003s)]
*  Political pundit. Yeah political pundit. No pundit. That's where the term comes from actually [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2476.26s)]
*  So the word pundit [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2482.1800000000003s)]
*  Comes from this word called pundit [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2484.34s)]
*  Uh, we're gonna yes, we're gonna talk about the zamindar. Uh them being part of the zamindar cast class as well [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2487.38s)]
*  We'll talk about that as well [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2492.82s)]
*  um [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2494.5s)]
*  And why they were targets again not justifying what they did but i'm just telling you why they were prime targets [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2496.26s)]
*  right [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2503.78s)]
*  Again, what they what happened to them was horrific. The chat is saying he's a religious, uh priest class like similar to that [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2505.3s)]
*  Yeah, so pundits is another way of saying brahmin basically. So brahmins are a group of cats [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2512.26s)]
*  So brahmins are a group of casts all throughout india again. This gets into cast a little bit, but they are [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2517.2200000000003s)]
*  The they are they're the pre they're the set of priest classes priest cast all throughout india. So there's ayur zangars [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2522.82s)]
*  Satisfied brahmin so on and so forth, right and these are hereditary classes, right you you are bored. I lost you again [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2530.2599999999998s)]
*  You're going him [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2537.3s)]
*  What is going on with my fucking mic this is going on fucking mike the modi government's coming after you [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2539.7799999999997s)]
*  They are [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2546.34s)]
*  Modi yeah modi doesn't like my setup. Yeah, they don't [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2547.3s)]
*  Uh, no, but the long story short is okay. So the long story short is they were expelled [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2550.1s)]
*  Uh, they were basically well they they left as a result of [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2554.5s)]
*  Repeated attacks on innocent, uh on on civilians done by right-wing fundamentalist groups [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2558.2599999999998s)]
*  Uh, but one immediate way of combating that is if the modi government actually cared about kashmiri pundits [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2564.8199999999997s)]
*  Then why the fuck have they not done anything about him? They've not done anything if they they're still living in squalid conditions [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2569.46s)]
*  Right if modi is somehow this protector of the kashmiri pundits [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2576.58s)]
*  Then why has the modi administration not done anything for them? They've only been using the kashmiri pundits as a as a uh, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2580.8199999999997s)]
*  as a you know peg as a as a [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2587.7s)]
*  Chest piece against to justify the indian state's violence against the kashmiri muslims [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2590.66s)]
*  Why is the modi administration not doing anything about that? [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2595.7s)]
*  Right, so that's an immediate uh, uh counter to that another thing. That is a bit of uh, that's true [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2598.58s)]
*  Uh is that many of these kashmiri pundits? [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2606.2599999999998s)]
*  Uh were part of the zamindar cast or they were part of the zamindar [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2609.7s)]
*  They were landowners basically they were uh, long story short [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2614.2599999999998s)]
*  They were part of the landowning classes of kashmir at the time. They were actually [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2618.1s)]
*  while the kashmiri uh muslims [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2622.66s)]
*  While the vast majority of kashmiri muslims were basically serfs, right? [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2625.62s)]
*  uh a good chunk of [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2630.74s)]
*  the uh, the the the the brahmin cast the brahmin uh kashmiris [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2633.7799999999997s)]
*  Were basically, uh, we're we're we're landowners, right? [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2640.26s)]
*  a lot of this sounds like [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2644.82s)]
*  british colonial holdovers [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2646.9s)]
*  It is all of it is british colonial holdovers. They were privileged under the british to some extent, right? [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2649.38s)]
*  Again, that's not just by anything that's like a classic british move [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2654.82s)]
*  Yes, so the the british basically put them as a divide and conquer rule as a divide and conquer tactic and then the third [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2658.9s)]
*  Uh, the other third I guess immediate [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2666.02s)]
*  uh [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2669.06s)]
*  the [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2670.02s)]
*  the other main talking point against the exodus of the kashmiri pundits [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2670.98s)]
*  Is that one of the original I guess, uh, uh guys that was pro kashmir [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2676.1s)]
*  Liberation that was pro independent kashmir to begin with [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2682.08s)]
*  uh was a hindu he was a hindu guy preem nat bazaz [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2685.62s)]
*  one of the biggest uh proponents of an independent kashmir that was uh, you could uh [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2690.74s)]
*  That that many kashmiris will hold up as a as a as a as a as a prime dude as a very [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2696.34s)]
*  uh [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2703.06s)]
*  Good guy is preem nat bazaz [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2704.02s)]
*  Uh, who was a hindu guy that was pro kashmiri independence [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2706.7400000000002s)]
*  right [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2711.54s)]
*  So again, there's this they're trying to bring a specifically communal angle [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2712.42s)]
*  A solely communal angle which is obscuring the class angle [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2718.1800000000003s)]
*  Uh the the yes preem nat bazaz was a socialist revolutionary and pro kashmiri liberation. Yes [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2722.2599999999998s)]
*  So he's one he's a great example of that and then also [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2729.2999999999997s)]
*  Another high profile guy yassin malik [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2732.8199999999997s)]
*  Who has been detained by the indian government since? [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2735.8599999999997s)]
*  uh literally said in the aftermath of those expulsions [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2738.74s)]
*  of the kashmiri uh pundits that they are the kashmiri pundits are an integral part of the kashmiri citizenry [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2743.54s)]
*  so they are trying to basically again, it's not to [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2752.1s)]
*  Downplay any of the feelings that the kashmiri pundits might have any of the anxieties that they might have of returning to kashmir whatsoever [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2756.58s)]
*  A lot of them are just a lot of them are justifiably [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2763.7s)]
*  Uh communal angle me. Okay. So when I talk about communal angle, that's a good question [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2767.7s)]
*  Actually when I say communal angle that is south asian slang for religious bigotry or ethnic bigotry [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2772.18s)]
*  That is south asian slang for religious bigotry or ethnic bigotry [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2778.1s)]
*  Uh, that's what that means. So they're basically trying to make [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2783.78s)]
*  The expulsion of the kashmiri pundits a solely religious angle [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2787.78s)]
*  Uh or a solely ethnic angle when that's actually not the case [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2793.14s)]
*  right [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2797.38s)]
*  but again, that doesn't justify any of the uh [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2798.58s)]
*  That doesn't justify [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2802.58s)]
*  Towards the kashmiri problem [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2805.14s)]
*  One last question for you nerd that was promised actually [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2808.1s)]
*  uh has an interesting, uh question here, but [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2810.66s)]
*  Uh, he says you should give your take on india claiming pakistan orchestrated the attack and pakistan claiming [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2813.86s)]
*  It was a false attack false flag attack by india long story short more [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2818.2599999999998s)]
*  You should give your take on india claiming pakistan orchestrated the attack [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2822.5s)]
*  Pakistan, okay. I have a doubt. Uh, I doubt that pakistan orchestrated the attack, uh [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2825.7599999999998s)]
*  because [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2831.7799999999997s)]
*  As we speak right now, the pakistani military is currently clamping down on baloch people in balochistan [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2832.9s)]
*  They have their own issues to deal with at the moment [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2839.2200000000003s)]
*  And aren't they doing like mass they've been doing massive partitions of like afghan refugees too, right? [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2841.54s)]
*  That was like last year, but the big thing this year is that they've been mass arresting [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2847.2200000000003s)]
*  Uh, they they arrested the leader of the baloch yak jayti committee [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2852.82s)]
*  Uh, which is they which is uh, uh marhang baloch [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2856.7400000000002s)]
*  Uh, they arrested her and they basically they're still holding her in prison at the moment and on top of that [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2861.08s)]
*  Uh, the other thing is [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2867.6400000000003s)]
*  Uh, they've forcibly disappeared [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2869.48s)]
*  Uh many baloch people never to be found ever again many of whom they've disabled permanently [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2872.44s)]
*  Um, but yes, that is the so I I doubt that pakistan is directly behind this what I think is going on is that again? [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2878.84s)]
*  a lot of the uh the [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2887.08s)]
*  a lot of the [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2889.48s)]
*  militant organizations that are operating in kashmir [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2891.24s)]
*  Are generally, uh, they're a lot of them are far right, right? They are [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2894.52s)]
*  Generally speaking far right, right? [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2901.0s)]
*  um, and [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2903.3199999999997s)]
*  They are [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2904.84s)]
*  It is true. Yes. It is true that pakistan does support [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2906.44s)]
*  Uh far right, uh fundamentalist organizations. That's true because it specifically undermines india [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2909.64s)]
*  but again, the bigger thing here is that those [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2915.08s)]
*  Groups are a reaction [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2918.84s)]
*  their blowback [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2921.0s)]
*  to decades and decades of getting the raw treatment, uh, getting the wrong getting the raw treatment by the indian [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2922.52s)]
*  By the indian government, um for for decades it though that is I don't think it's a child flag operation [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2930.2s)]
*  What I I don't know. I don't want to make any declarative statements about it being a phone [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2935.96s)]
*  So here this is the point that I was going to make pakistan's defense minister told sky news [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2941.64s)]
*  We've been funding terror orgs on behalf of the u.s [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2945.8s)]
*  Here it is. You do admit sir that that pakistan has had a long history of backing and supporting and training [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2948.44s)]
*  I just want to say my life for pakistan and funding these terrorist organizations [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2955.6400000000003s)]
*  Well, uh, we have to do this dirty work for you [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2962.1200000000003s)]
*  Be careful dude all the time to come after you man and west. I don't care including britain [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2965.96s)]

*  Sorry [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2973.0s)]
*  He said it again. Well, uh, we have been doing this dirty work for united states for about three decades, you know [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2973.96s)]
*  and west [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2980.2799999999997s)]
*  including britain [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2981.7999999999997s)]
*  Damn, he said we've been doing this for about three decades [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2983.72s)]
*  Uh, we've been doing this dirty work for about three decades for the west and britain [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2987.56s)]
*  so that's your argument that [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2993.16s)]
*  She she she is a dumbfounded a little bit that he just came out and said it [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=2995.8799999999997s)]
*  I mean, that's the thing about indian and pakistani politics. We don't give a fuck [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3001.56s)]
*  like [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3005.48s)]
*  We genuinely do not give a fuck. We are [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3006.44s)]
*  We are extremely honest. That's the thing [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3009.16s)]
*  Genuinely do not give a fuck. We are [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3012.2s)]
*  honest to a [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3014.44s)]
*  We're unfortunately [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3015.8799999999997s)]
*  Uh vile to a fault [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3017.8799999999997s)]
*  openly vile to a fault [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3020.2s)]
*  Um, but yeah, that's the yeah, so I I don't know whether they did this on behalf of the united states [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3022.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't know whether they I don't know whether pakistan was funding and backing and arming those militants in kashmir [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3028.36s)]
*  Uh at the behest of the u.s [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3034.52s)]
*  I don't know why would the u.s even do that though? Is it to like make sure that if there's any sort of [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3037.08s)]
*  I don't know normalized relations with china that they could use this as a as a cudgel against india and and try to [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3042.92s)]
*  Destabilize india. I feel like I have no idea man. I that's the reason that I don't know why any [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3049.54s)]
*  I don't know why the u.s would be super interested in i mean, I think what he's talking about is specifically the taliban like what he's talking about [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3054.44s)]
*  Yeah, he's talking about the he's talking about the mujahideen and uh and the arming [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3063.08s)]
*  the arming of of [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3068.44s)]
*  fundamentals groups that literally got training in madrasas in pakistan that is true that is [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3070.92s)]
*  Precisely what he's probably talking about. So I don't think he's talking about anything other than afghanistan here [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3076.76s)]
*  Um, no, we we that that was a mistake and we suffered for that [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3082.12s)]
*  And that is why you are saying this to to to to me [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3087.3199999999997s)]
*  If we had not joined the war, uh [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3090.68s)]
*  The other thing that I want to mention is that nerd makes a good point [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3094.12s)]
*  It is important to note that pakistan and india are perfectly capable of fucking over people in the region without explicit direction of the cia [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3097.0s)]
*  That is true [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3103.72s)]
*  Again india has done a lot of fucked up shit not at the behest of the cia [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3105.48s)]
*  again [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3109.64s)]
*  Against soviet union and later on the the war after 9 11. Uh, this uh pakistan's uh [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3111.08s)]
*  Track record, you know was uh, not uh, you know an unimpeachable track record defense minister [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3117.16s)]
*  I just want to get back to um this particular incident in kashmir and and the noises that are now coming out of delhi [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3123.3199999999997s)]
*  Do you believe this situation is going to escalate and that india will launch airstrikes is pakistan preparing itself for that? [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3131.4s)]
*  We are already prepared for it, you know [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3139.88s)]
*  We are already prepared for it any eventuality which takes place in next one or two or three or four days of [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3141.96s)]
*  week or ten days [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3148.84s)]
*  We we will retaliate and we'll react to that, you know in any kind [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3150.36s)]
*  Inshallah, how will you respond if india does launch a series of airstrikes? [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3154.52s)]
*  We will measure our response to whatever is uh initiated sounds in in like an insane question [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3161.56s)]
*  Am I right like this is two nuclear nations that are not exactly fond of one another [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3167.96s)]
*  The idea that there would be like the idea that there would be any sort of tit for tat [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3173.5600000000004s)]
*  like actual cross-border operations it sounds [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3178.92s)]
*  pretty crazy [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3183.8s)]
*  Yeah, because I mean yeah because two nuclear armed powers [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3185.5600000000004s)]
*  Like the the indian pakistan going at each other is probably one of the most dangerous like [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3190.92s)]
*  Scenarios we could possibly live in right [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3196.02s)]
*  These again like you said there are two nuclear armed powers like they're they're two nuclear armed powers. There's no shot that they [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3199.56s)]
*  Like if they escalate any further than we're we're all doomed like that's that's the bigger problem here if they [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3206.6s)]
*  But I I don't I honestly in my heart of hearts don't like I think people have been looking at this from uh india versus pakistan lens [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3213.3999999999996s)]
*  Because of the fact that what happened at eleventh 26? What was the retaliation from the indian government? [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3220.6s)]
*  After the the mumbai [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3224.6s)]
*  Attack I don't remember. I think I remember them going on a uh, I remember them going on a uh, [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3227.96s)]
*  Wild on a on a hunt. It was actually surprisingly very measured in comparison to [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3234.68s)]
*  Because that was manmohan singh at the time and they basically went after the guys that were responsible and and [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3240.92s)]
*  They've since been executed basically the long story short is that there's nothing notable happened in the wake of 26 11 [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3246.92s)]
*  But other than that like nothing like like nothing nothing in the nothing in the the scale of uh, [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3252.92s)]
*  We're gonna escalate with pakistan nothing like that. Okay [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3260.04s)]
*  All right. Well, thank you so much for coming on. Is there any uh last words you want to you want to impart on us for? [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3263.48s)]
*  Yeah, so a couple of things. Uh, so I mean you had me so a couple of things I want to impart [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3269.2400000000002s)]
*  So one thing first thing is uh [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3273.88s)]
*  So I know you had a guy from india on I highly recommend you have someone actually [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3276.28s)]
*  From kashmir on to talk about this if you're interested a guy called azad [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3281.32s)]
*  Isa I think he's been on sam cedars show before [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3285.2400000000002s)]
*  Azad i'll send you the link. You should probably have this guy on probably [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3289.88s)]
*  Um, so that's point number one [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3294.04s)]
*  Because I again I can only give you uh my perspective on the situation as someone from india [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3296.52s)]
*  And then the second thing is uh, so [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3302.1200000000003s)]
*  Just a quick question. Uh, so whose dick do I have to suck to get you to watch uh, [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm_G3APIhqk&t=3305.48s)]
