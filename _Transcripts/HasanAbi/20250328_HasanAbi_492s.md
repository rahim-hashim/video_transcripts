# 7.7 Earthquake Rocks Thailand & Myanmar | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [March 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo)
*  7.7 is a crazy magnitude. Also, as I've talked about with Turkey, personal experiences in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=0.0s)]
*  Turkey and the recent arthurs that took place in Turkey and northern Syria. 7.7 especially [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=8.0s)]
*  depending on what kind of ground it's on. But more importantly than that, what kind [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=17.7s)]
*  of infrastructure you have can be super. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=23.62s)]
*  Begin with breaking news for you on a powerful and deadly earthquake. It's in Southeast Asia. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=33.620000000000005s)]
*  And take a look at these pictures. They really tell the story. It was 7.7 magnitude quake. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=38.42s)]
*  Oh, boy. Whoa. Caused at least one tower you see under construction to collapse right there [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=43.82s)]
*  on the spot. This was in Bangkok, which is, you know, the capital of Thailand. Oh, boy. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=48.82s)]
*  The earthquake was centered just across the border in Myanmar. Anna Corrin has the latest [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=53.300000000000004s)]
*  for us. Anna, good morning. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=57.7s)]
*  Yeah, good morning, Gail. That video absolutely shocking. You can only imagine the terror [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=62.7s)]
*  felt by the people there in Bangkok. Thailand's defense minister says three people are dead, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=66.9s)]
*  90 are missing. But there's obviously fear that death toll will rise. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=72.9s)]
*  Disbelief turned to sheer panic in the streets of Bangkok as a 30 story skyscraper under [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=77.9s)]
*  construction suddenly collapsed following a powerful earthquake, which sent people in [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=84.9s)]
*  Thailand's capital running for their lives. Officials say the 7.7 magnitude quake hit in [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=89.9s)]
*  neighboring Myanmar hundreds of miles away with the epicenter located near Mandalay, the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=95.9s)]
*  country's second largest city on Friday afternoon. There, a mosque was reduced to rubble. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=100.9s)]
*  With worshipers inside while Mandalay's University was engulfed in thick black smoke, Myanmar's [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=106.9s)]
*  military hunter has declared a state of emergency and has made a rare appeal for international [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=112.9s)]
*  aid. Back in Bangkok, eyewitness reports of violent shaking lasting for up to a minute [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=117.9s)]
*  in a city that's home to 17 million people. 7.7 is a crazy magnitude. Also, as I've talked [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=123.9s)]
*  about with Turkey, personal experiences in Turkey and the recent earthquakes that took [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=131.9s)]
*  place in Turkey and Northern Syria, 7.7, especially depending on what kind of ground it's on, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=138.9s)]
*  but more importantly than that, what kind of infrastructure you have can be super devastating. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=149.9s)]
*  And obviously, especially in places like Myanmar, where I suspect the infrastructure is not [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=156.9s)]
*  designed or built against that sort of thing, that's the reason why you see way more casualties. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=161.9s)]
*  Many who live in high-rise buildings and felt a 6.4 aftershock just minutes later nearby at a [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=171.9s)]
*  shopping center. Immediately there was screaming, there was a lot of panic. I just started walking [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=178.9s)]
*  calmly at first, but then the building started really moving. Video from inside an apartment [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=184.9s)]
*  building shows chandeliers and people terrified of more aftershocks choosing to wait outside. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=189.9s)]
*  Water could be seen from the rooftop pool of Bangkok's Intercontinental Hotel gushing out [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=195.9s)]
*  from over the sides as it shook. It's unclear how many people are dead or injured, but officials [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=200.9s)]
*  say dozens of construction workers were believed to be on site of the skyscraper the moment [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=206.9s)]
*  the earth violently shook. Now the fact that this earthquake was so shallow, only six miles deep, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=211.9s)]
*  is why it was so violent and felt so far across from Thailand to Myanmar. We haven't heard an [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=218.9s)]
*  official toll from the military junta on deaths or injuries, but the fact they've asked for [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=226.9s)]
*  international assistance is incredibly unusual and perhaps a sign of how desperate the situation is [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=232.9s)]
*  on the ground. Tony. Dramatic pictures will keep following Anna Korn in the Hong Kong forest. Anna, thank you very much. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=238.9s)]
*  A massive 7.7 magnitude earthquake rocked Southeast Asia today, followed by a powerful aftershock. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=244.9s)]
*  It happened near Mandalay, Myanmar, which is the second largest city. That quake reverberated across the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=251.9s)]
*  region from Thailand to China. Now in Myanmar, state TV reports that more than 140 people are now dead, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=258.9s)]
*  with 730 injured. Buildings were seen swaying with bridges, roads and places of worship collapsing. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=265.9s)]
*  NBC News international correspondent Ralph Sanchez joins us now. Ralph, just tell us more about the damage and the victims. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=272.9s)]
*  How bad is it? It's bad, Joe. Myanmar is suffering what is basically a one-two punch here. You have a 7.7 magnitude [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=278.9s)]
*  earthquake and then just 12 minutes later, 6.4 magnitude aftershock, as you said, rocking the country's [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=286.9s)]
*  second biggest city. The military regime in Myanmar is saying 144 people are dead, 730 injured, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=294.9s)]
*  but that there may very well be worse to come. And we also saw destruction across the border in Thailand, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=303.9s)]
*  at least nine people dead in Bangkok. And at one building site alone, there are currently more than 100 people [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=309.9s)]
*  missing. And I want you to listen to the accounts of some of the survivors from the quake in Bangkok. Take a listen. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=317.9s)]
*  I felt myself swaying a little bit, so I thought, okay, this is not quite normal. And just as I was about to start taking [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=324.9s)]
*  things, the shaking was really intense. I was turning to my boss and I was like, do you feel the same thing? And she's like, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=333.9s)]
*  yeah, I thought it was me. And then the light started to fall off the floor, the ground. And then we ran down to the building, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=341.9s)]
*  a 20-foot floor. So search and rescue operations currently underway. We are expecting the toll to rise on both sides of [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=348.9s)]
*  the border. And Joe, the USGS is saying the ultimate death toll could be in the thousands. Jeff? And Raph, one of the reasons [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=356.9s)]
*  it's been hard to get information out of Myanmar is that it's been tied up in a civil war for the last four years. It's controlled [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=363.9s)]
*  by a military government. How are they dealing with this disaster? So far, they have declared a state of emergency across [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=368.9s)]
*  much of the country. As you say, there are big questions about whether the authoritarian nature of Myanmar is going to hamper [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=376.9s)]
*  the relief efforts. So far, the military regime is saying it is accepting help from neighboring countries, including India, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=383.9s)]
*  that it's opened up its borders in order to get more aid in. They are applying for, or appealing rather, for blood donations. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=390.9s)]
*  But as you say, there is an ongoing civil war, especially in the Rohingya region, questions about whether aid is going to reach. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=398.9s)]
*  Why are chatter saying that there is no military mobilization in Myanmar? I don't know what's going on here, but there is. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=405.9s)]
*  There are still war factions in parts of the country. It is a military junta, one that is aligned with the Chinese government. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=414.9s)]
*  They mentioned India, but not China, I assume, for that reason. Like, this is true. It's not a false statement. But yes, there are other [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=426.9s)]
*  countries in the region that are also, I suspect, immediately offering aid. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=437.9s)]
*  Each areas that the government doesn't control. And we're waiting to see, Joe, whether they will be transparent about the full scale of damage. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=441.9s)]
*  Jeff. All right. Raf Sanchez, thank you so much. Thanks for watching. Stay updated about... [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=449.9s)]
*  Aftershock forecast says 40% chance of a 6 plus in the next week, 90% chance of a 5 plus. I know you're wrong. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=453.9s)]
*  China's position on Myanmar has been historically neutral. China, depending on the immediate needs that China has, will oftentimes either arm the [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=460.9s)]
*  militancy against the military junta or directly support the military junta. It's not... No, that's not to say that they're neutral is incorrect. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=471.9s)]
*  They definitely support the current government. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=482.9s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nEq_Nk1Jo&t=490.9s)]
