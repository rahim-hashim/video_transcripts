# Did I Defend AOC And Bernie Sanders? | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [April 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY)
*  I've never made that point. I have plenty of criticisms for AOC and Bernie Sanders and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=0.0s)]
*  numerous other politicians that are aligned with me on some issues, but not aligned with me on [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=5.12s)]
*  others or they don't go far enough in the way that I want to in the way that I want them to. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=10.72s)]
*  But like the idea that the the idea that like these are the only targets of of [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  is so incredibly stupid. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=25.04s)]
*  He said I was a Nazi for interviewing AOC and Bernie. I can't tell if people are just like, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=31.68s)]
*  I can't tell if those people are personally like mentally ill and they're just like engaging in [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=38.08s)]
*  record behavior for free or if they truly hold these convictions because they're mentally ill [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=46.24s)]
*  or because they're mentally ill and and you know they're getting paid to do this or something. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=52.88s)]
*  I don't understand it because there's purity checkers out there that just like genuinely feel [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  like this conviction in their hearts. They just don't understand it. Like someone being like you [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=67.52000000000001s)]
*  interviewed AOC and Bernie Sanders. You are a Nazi like you have to be out of your mind. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=73.04s)]
*  You have to truly be an insane person. I should have never. What is this? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=79.44s)]
*  Bad empanada is correct about a song. I had to unsubscribe from a song after his rant last night. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=84.24s)]
*  That was embarrassing as well. You also sat down people who have supported the genocide [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=88.0s)]
*  and gave them gifts. What the fuck. Oh they're followed by film the police. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  L.A. No this person is just an anarchist. I think like that's probably what it is. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=97.28s)]
*  This is just like a really sweaty person who whose heart might be in the right. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=104.4s)]
*  Their overall mentality might be correct on the world but like the targets they pick are [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=110.88000000000001s)]
*  almost always going to be other people who are closest to them. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That makes [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=115.84s)]
*  sense. Yeah. What. I'm a conservative but I do not understand why other people call people Nazis [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=121.36000000000001s)]
*  for the simple fact of exercising their constitutional rights of free speech. I mean I don't know. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=126.48s)]
*  Maybe if they're exercising their constitutional right to free speech in a Nazi kind of way then [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=130.64s)]
*  yeah it's pretty valid. Please stop deflecting good faith criticism. What are you saying. What [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=134.88s)]
*  are you saying. What. None of this is good faith criticism. A lot of you are just simply babies. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=140.64s)]
*  This is your first protest is your first movement that you've like joined in on and [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=145.44s)]
*  you don't know anything. You're just like a rudderless anchorless ship floating around. Shut up. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=152.32s)]
*  What is happening today. What is going on. Stop glazing genocidal politicians then. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=161.2s)]
*  No dude I'm not going to. I love genocidal politicians. I love the genocide. OK. That's [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=168.95999999999998s)]
*  what it is. I'm just a fan. I can't tell if you guys are doing April Fools or not but like [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=175.11999999999998s)]
*  what do you want me to do. Spend every day talking about Bernie Sanders is liberal Zionism. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=180.23999999999998s)]
*  I have covered it time and time again. I am critical of Bernie Sanders on this issue. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=184.23999999999998s)]
*  I don't know why you guys want me to just exclusively. You know what guys. Today just [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=188.32s)]
*  like yesterday and the day prior we are just only going to talk about Bernie Sanders. OK. Finally [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=193.6s)]
*  the sweatiest crustiest losers on the planet will maybe hopefully think well this guy is morally [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=200.56s)]
*  consistent and intellectually honest. Shut the. OK. Shut up. You're not doing you're not doing [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=206.56s)]
*  advocacy. You're crying in a Twitch chat. You are crying in a Twitch chat. You are crying in a [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=214.16s)]
*  Twitch chat. You are not an activist. You're a loser. OK. Seriously. And if this is your [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=220.16s)]
*  worldview if your worldview revolves around like almost exclusively yelling at a Twitch streamer [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=225.92s)]
*  who you know is aligned with your worldview that is interviewing politicians or at least is like [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=233.68s)]
*  close to politicians that are also infinitely closer to your worldview. I'm not even talking [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=241.36s)]
*  about Bernie Sanders at this point. I'm talking about AOC specifically who people yell about all [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=246.32s)]
*  the time but like she literally called it a genocide way before anybody else did. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=250.16s)]
*  If you if your expectation is like those guys are actually in the wrong. If those politicians are [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=255.44s)]
*  are the worst politicians in U.S. Congress you're stupid. You know. Well to be honest I'm not here [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=261.6s)]
*  all the time. OK. What are you a baby. Are you a child. Are you a child person. Are you a person [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=269.2s)]
*  with a childish brain. OK. You don't know what I do in my free time. That's what I'm talking about. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=275.52s)]
*  Do you have object permanence. Don't you think it's up to you to go and maybe perhaps see what [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=281.76s)]
*  my perspective is instead of instead of assuming that there is a good faith criticism here. Why [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=286.71999999999997s)]
*  call me a loser because you're behaving like a loser to be like go yell at Republicans and say [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=292.96s)]
*  no not even Republicans. There's like there are hundreds of Democrats in positions of power [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=299.2s)]
*  that you could yell at. And this isn't to say that you should not criticize. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=307.28s)]
*  This isn't to say that you should not criticize AOC at all ever that these policies are infallible [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=314.08s)]
*  or whatever. That's not what I'm saying at all. I've never made that point. I have plenty of [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=320.56s)]
*  criticisms for AOC and Bernie Sanders and numerous other politicians that are aligned with me on some [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=325.12s)]
*  issues but not aligned with me on others or they don't go far enough in the way that I want to in [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=330.88s)]
*  the way that I want them to. But like the idea that the idea that like these are the only targets [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=336.96s)]
*  of of ire is so incredibly stupid. And this also in and of itself is incredibly stupid. You know [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=345.68s)]
*  anyway I got baited. I'll admit I got baited by a stupid ass person. I'm just I'm gonna kick them [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=353.36s)]
*  out and just like delete my post. That's probably the most effective way to talk about. That's the [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=361.6s)]
*  most effective way to deal with this kind of shit instead of just like taking it seriously and [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=367.6s)]
*  responding to it because a lot of people don't actually want to learn anything. They don't want [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=372.32s)]
*  to they don't want to genuinely have discourse. It's just more so just stirring shit up. But yes [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=378.4s)]
*  why aren't you responding to my criticisms of you. I don't know because they're invalid [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=385.67999999999995s)]
*  because your criticisms of me are that I'm circumcised and that's not up to me. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=391.28s)]
*  You're just reiterating the fact that I'm circumcised and it's hurting my feelings. I wish [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=398.88s)]
*  I wasn't. Okay they took that away from me and you're out here you're out here reminding everybody [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=403.76s)]
*  that they stole something from me. You know what I mean. They chopped it up. They chopped my shit up. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=410.48s)]
*  They took away my hoodie. It's out in the cold. You have to. You're Muslim. I don't care. Yeah [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=418.0s)]
*  there are eight house resolutions of block weapons. Israel 14 members are on all eight AOC. Greg [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=424.48s)]
*  Kazar Garcia Green Jayapal Johnson Lee from Pennsylvania in Hanomar Pican Presley Ramirez [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=430.72s)]
*  Tlaib Velasquez and Watson Coleman and hella dudes are only yelling at only yelling at some of these [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=439.12s)]
*  people that are just in front of them. I'm sorry if my point always is the same if the rest of [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=448.56s)]
*  Congress resembled even Bernie Sanders's position which is nowhere near as critical as like AOC and [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=454.88s)]
*  some of these other people's positions are like Rashida Tlaib obviously. That's not even my [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=463.36s)]
*  expectation but like even if the majority the overwhelming majority of Congress demonstrated [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=466.88s)]
*  Bernie Sanders's attitude about Israel a big chunk of this violence would never never be initiated [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=471.52s)]
*  and Bernie Sanders is not the best on this either. Like that's the other thing. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=479.44s)]
*  We need to move beyond that as well for sure but in the interim you have to work with what you have [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=487.6s)]
*  at your disposal tools you have at your disposal. Yeah Bernie this is the house resolutions. Bernie's [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=494.48s)]
*  in the Senate. Bernie is also pushed for a Senate resolution to block weapons to Israel ironically [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=501.68s)]
*  enough which green that they're referring to I think Al Green but instead but instead you're in [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=506.88s)]
*  here yelling at a Twitch streamer who is a in fairly prominent fairly prominent anti-Zionist [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=513.76s)]
*  okay who gets attacked all the time for his anti-Zionist positions because of because of his [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=524.32s)]
*  collaboration with congresspersons who themselves are not anti-Zionist obviously. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=531.04s)]
*  That's not the case but are infinitely closer to your position to your worldview than like [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=536.7199999999999s)]
*  99.9 percent of Congress. It's stupid. That's it. You go out and build the tools and I'll [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=543.04s)]
*  fucking I'll work with you too you know what I mean. Do you see what I'm saying. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=550.24s)]
*  Do you understand like this is the this is a tool. These are our public servants. Okay. They're [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=554.16s)]
*  supposed to represent our interests and in that process I am not shy about explaining to you that [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=561.4399999999999s)]
*  like I grade Congress on a curve and in that in that situation I have to look at like what the [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=569.92s)]
*  rest of Congress's attitude is on this issue and these people are infinitely closer to you. These [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=576.16s)]
*  people are infinitely closer to you in their viewpoints. They're infinitely closer to you [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=582.72s)]
*  in comparison to the rest of Congress. The expectation is to move the rest of Congress [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=588.1600000000001s)]
*  to this trajectory and then move them further to the left. Anyway how do you have the conversation [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=592.48s)]
*  with these people without losing your shit. Very impressive. I have maintained a community of [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=599.36s)]
*  I've maintained a fairly large community of incredibly active and incredibly vocal leftists [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=604.4s)]
*  for the past 10 years and especially on Twitch for the last what since 2018 [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=610.64s)]
*  for the last seven years. So that's what it is and I still lose my shit. It's impossible not to [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=618.24s)]
*  right. It's freaking impossible not to. Anyway this is just like remember remember the tenant [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=624.96s)]
*  be normal be normal. I'm sure you can if you cultivate a different attitude. I mean I have. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=633.44s)]
*  That's why this community is the size that it is and the broad majority of people in this community [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=641.12s)]
*  the broad majority of people in this community are pretty forgiving and pretty empathetic and are [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=647.76s)]
*  guided by empathy first and foremost and care about instilling class consciousness and developing [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=652.96s)]
*  solidarity with others. But then there's always going to be loud brash and oftentimes [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=658.88s)]
*  narcissistic people that may not even be doing like wrecker behavior may not demonstrate wrecker [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=664.8s)]
*  behavior ideologically but instead are doing it because they just want to be heard. You know they [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=670.56s)]
*  want that sweet sweet dopamine rush that dopamine hit of streamer notice me streamer responded to me. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=676.16s)]
*  I got something out of him. In any case none of this matters which is what's so funny about it. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=684.88s)]
*  Like people will be like um what is happening with my eyes. I can't see. I'm like losing my vision [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=690.96s)]
*  right now. What the hell. What do you say to someone who's a compromising on morals and [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=697.52s)]
*  beliefs with Bernie and he's going to end up compromising with the Dems in the past. I'm not [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=700.96s)]
*  saying I think that but it's a valid reason why people are reluctant to support Bernie. Okay don't [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=703.76s)]
*  support him then. It's fine. I think he's going to be fine without I think he's going to be fine [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=706.96s)]
*  without the the support of a bunch of like leftist tiktokers or whatever or their communities. He's [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=713.52s)]
*  got fucking 34 000 people showing up to rallies. I'm sorry he's got the motion. He's got the motion. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUQTWCnUzhY&t=719.12s)]
