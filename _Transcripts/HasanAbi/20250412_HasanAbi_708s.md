# Breaks Down Woke Police Shows | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [April 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4)
*  It's a HBO show, but it's a medical drama on HBO. But it's really good because it subtly, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=0.0s)]
*  and in certain instances not so subtly, tackles a bunch of labor-related problems that exist in [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=6.72s)]
*  the American hospital system, profit-seeking in the healthcare structure, what kind of impact that [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=12.08s)]
*  has on the average like emergency room doctor and the nurses. All of that stuff is excellent. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=17.68s)]
*  Folks, we're live and alive and I hope all the boys, girls and enbies are having a fantastic [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=30.0s)]
*  one. This is a beautiful day. Today's a wonderful day. Today is freaking Saturday, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=32.64s)]
*  sexy Saturday, Bernard AOC rally later. That is right. This is April 12th, 2025, 11.33 AM. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=36.96s)]
*  I'm Assam Piker and I hope everyone's having a fantastic one. It is 67 degrees and sunny [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=44.56s)]
*  here in California, Los Angeles. I'm having a great one and I hope so are you. This is part of [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=49.44s)]
*  the broadcast where I tell you about my personal news. I'm going to run through really quickly [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=54.72s)]
*  what has happened to the world of Assam Hassan. I'll be piker in between the time period where [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=58.16s)]
*  I press the stop streaming button, press the star streaming button. So help me God. That's right. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=60.959999999999994s)]
*  And not a lot has taken place in my life. I'm obviously hanging out with, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=65.84s)]
*  you aren't called Hassan Abiy anymore. Hassan Hassan, I'll be piker. Anyway, the rally is [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=70.8s)]
*  getting super full. Yeah. I know the rally's probably already started. I mean, it already [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=75.75999999999999s)]
*  started. People are already there. People are already been packing in since 9 AM. I don't even [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=79.19999999999999s)]
*  know if we're going to be able to get in. It's pretty crazy. In any case, I'm going to be, of [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=82.8s)]
*  course, waiting for a Marchie poo to get here and then we're going to be dipping out to go to the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=86.88s)]
*  rally. I'll be taking you to the rally, of course. But having said that, this is the part of the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=92.08s)]
*  broadcast where I tell you about my personal news, about what's going on in the world of Assam, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=97.11999999999999s)]
*  outside of a piker, like I said, and that is what I'm going to do. So help me God. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=99.84s)]
*  Okay. So first and foremost, end of the broadcast last night, hung out with the family, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=104.88s)]
*  turned on the pit. For those of you who don't know, I started watching the pit and it's awesome. It's [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=111.75999999999999s)]
*  a medical drama, 2025 HBO medical drama. And it's really good starring no while also known as Dr. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=120.16s)]
*  Michael Robbie, I think. I don't know, but a very handsome lad, very handsome fellow. And I wanted [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=128.32s)]
*  to watch it with my mom and my dad, but my dad immediately was like, I'm not watching this shit. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=137.92s)]
*  He apparently is not capable of watching any sort of blood or gore. That's right. He quit. He quit [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=144.64s)]
*  because he could not watch. You cannot get himself to watch anything with gore. And not only could he [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=154.16s)]
*  not watch anything with gore in it. He also said we're psychopathic for watching a show with so [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=159.76s)]
*  much gore in it. So that's classic Baba stuff, you know, classic Bob behavior. Yeah. He's, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=165.52s)]
*  he just could not, he could not get himself to watch it. I did. I watched the first episode in [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  the second episode. Let me say it's pretty good show. Pretty gruesome show. A lot of subtle [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=176.96s)]
*  undertones, a lot of, uh, it's one of those shows that's like extra woke cause it's HBO, but it's [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=181.04000000000002s)]
*  also all of those shows are woke. I've talked about this before, like all the cop shows and shows like [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=186.0s)]
*  they are all very woke shows, right? For those of you who don't know the pit, the pit, the pit, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=193.12s)]
*  the show I'm talking about is the pit. Okay. But shows like, you know, nine one one first responder [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=199.68s)]
*  cops, uh, FBI, America's crime unit, whatever the they're called. Like they're all technically [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=206.88s)]
*  cop again, the shows very much cop again, very much constantly, uh, explaining to you why no, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=212.4s)]
*  no, no, the cop shows, cop again, the shows are very, very woke. You guys are wrong. If you think [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=218.72s)]
*  they're not woke, they're woke in like the liberal Democrat social consciousness, uh, wokeness. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  And it's important to recognize that it's actually cop again, but it's woke because it plays a very [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=231.83999999999997s)]
*  interesting role of, I think moderating people that watch the show. So it turns liberals into [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=236.64s)]
*  lovers of cops who think cops are always brave and bold and beautiful and defending, uh, the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=243.52s)]
*  interests of the public. And sometimes they have complicated moments where they do bad things, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=249.36s)]
*  but actually it's, you know, they, they were doing that for a good cause, right? Like that's the, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=254.16000000000003s)]
*  so if you're like a leftist or a liberal or whatever, it's supposed to moderate your position [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=258.72s)]
*  to be pro cop. But if you are a right-wing reactionary in the middle of the country and [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=262.24s)]
*  you're watching those shows, it's actually insanely woke because every episode, first of all, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=266.8s)]
*  diverse cast, you got like Indian cops, you know, you got Mexican cops, things like that. So it's [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=273.03999999999996s)]
*  like very diverse cast first and foremost. So that's like cool for you to see like, cause, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=278.56s)]
*  and they'll, they'll tackle like racial dynamics, things of that nature, right? So, um, gay cops, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=283.91999999999996s)]
*  right? Like all of that stuff exists in these shows. And also on top of that, they will tackle [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=291.12s)]
*  issues like they will literally cover like transgender related issues. You know what I mean? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=297.52s)]
*  Like they will literally talk about like the, the dis the discrimination that like gay people, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=302.56s)]
*  uh, face, uh, and, and they'll teach people consent. Like they, they serve this very [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=309.68s)]
*  interesting role of moderating the position of American consciousness. I have been thinking [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=315.68s)]
*  quite a lot about this, but anyway, the pit in and of itself is not like that. It's an HBO show, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=320.88s)]
*  but it's a medical drama on HBO, but it's really good. Um, because it subtly and in certain [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=325.76s)]
*  instances, not so subtly tackles a bunch of labor related problems that exist in the American [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=332.0s)]
*  hospital system, profit seeking in the healthcare structure. What kind of impact that has on the [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=337.28s)]
*  average, like emergency room doctor and the nurses, all of that stuff is, is excellent. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=343.84s)]
*  The first, the, yeah, there's a, there's a hyper-focused on social work and the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=350.15999999999997s)]
*  importance of social work in the medical field as well. The first episode was great. First episode [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=355.28s)]
*  starts off with like, uh, you know, uh, the, the friction between the hospital administrator and [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=360.32s)]
*  a suit coming down, talking to this doctor, uh, in the midst of like, you know, him getting his [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=364.71999999999997s)]
*  hands bloody, uh, left and right. Cause this ER, the emergency room is overloaded, right? Hospital [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=370.4s)]
*  administrators, like you're not serving these clients, like these patients well enough that [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=375.84s)]
*  their satisfaction rates are not high. And he's like, well, we have beds upstairs. Why don't we [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=380.32s)]
*  use those beds? This is an overflow facility. You're constantly doing triage. Of course, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=384.47999999999996s)]
*  they're not going to be happy. I just am barely making ends meet and barely making them survive [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=388.56s)]
*  out here. You asshole, right? That's a huge issue. They, they even talk about how they don't, you [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=393.59999999999997s)]
*  don't want to hire more nurses. You don't want to hire. She says there's a nursing shortage around [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=399.91999999999996s)]
*  the country. And it's like, no, you just don't want to hire more nurses because that's more [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=404.32s)]
*  too costly to the hospital. So it is really, really good. Um, it, it shows like the incredible [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=407.44s)]
*  amount of pressure that like our medical professionals go through, especially in ERs [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=416.56s)]
*  because ER is the one mechanism that like poor people can use in general or poor people often [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=420.88s)]
*  do use in general because like they don't go to the hospital until it's far too late. So [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=426.88s)]
*  it's just overloaded. Homi, you're watching Boomer daytime TV dramas? Yeah, I am, but it's very good. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=432.0s)]
*  And, uh, so I liked that. And then the second episode, there was a, there was a sickle cell [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=438.24s)]
*  moment where like they are, uh, you know, the, the white, the, the white first responders are like [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=443.92s)]
*  literally restraining this woman. She's black, uh, and she's going through unimaginable pain, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=451.68s)]
*  but they're like, they're, they're treating her like she's a tweaker. Right. And there's a, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=457.92s)]
*  there's a moment where like they subtly, but not so subtly talk about medical racism without like [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=464.08000000000004s)]
*  serving it to you directly. It's very good. I like it a lot. I like it a lot. It's a, it's very cool [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=470.0s)]
*  that they, that they were doing that shit anyway. I've never seen house, but the show is called the [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=476.32s)]
*  pit. I've been watching. I watched two episodes. It's tough. Watch. It's a tough watch. Okay. I [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=482.0s)]
*  will admit it is a freaking tough watch. It's very gory. Yeah. It's incredibly gory. It's a medical [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=488.56s)]
*  drama on HBO. Of course it's incredibly gory. Um, but yeah, I, um, did you rug pull my day one founder [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=494.08s)]
*  series merge purchase? What, what are you, what are the words that are coming out of your mouth [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=502.08s)]
*  or what are you even typing in my chat right now? I have no idea. Anyway, so that show was great. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=508.16s)]
*  Uh, beyond the show, where my merch out, bro. I don't know. Why are you asking me dumb ass? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=512.72s)]
*  What the fuck? Do I look like a, like a help desk here? What's happening? Go hit the Warren James, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=518.32s)]
*  uh, line. They, they're supposed to do this exactly. I'm not customer service. Aren't you [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=525.36s)]
*  the CEO of the merge? No. What do you think? I personally package every single merge and like [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=531.44s)]
*  give them a little kiss at the end of the night in the two hours that I have. No, I'm watching [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=536.56s)]
*  the pit. Get that woke Liptoard shit out of here. I only watched stars reruns of cops, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=542.0s)]
*  like a real American. Anyway, um, all of that aside, uh, yeah, went to bed, woke up this morning [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=546.8s)]
*  and, uh, let me tell you, woke up early, hit the weights, uh, hit some good weights. Actually, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=554.9599999999999s)]
*  here's your boy, uh, going for nine, going for nine reps here. Um, yeah, here gave you a little [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=564.24s)]
*  titty pick as well for all the, for all the psychos out there, for all the lovers of the titty picks. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=569.84s)]
*  Here's a little bit of titty for you. Here's the itty bitty titty. I I've been, I've been [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=576.8s)]
*  tidied out the wazoo. I'm not gonna lie. This is probably why, cause I've been pumping. I've been [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=581.6s)]
*  pumping. Look at that. Look how many reps the boys putting on there. That's two or five, dude. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=586.24s)]
*  It's not a big deal. Hitting that for nine. No, not even a spotter. I could have hit it for 10, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=592.72s)]
*  but I didn't have a spotter, so I didn't want to risk it. You know, no hoop lately. Feel like I [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=598.88s)]
*  haven't heard much. No, I've been hooping. I'm just not very good at hooping. Uh, but yeah, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=606.5600000000001s)]
*  those are double D's. Austin posted a titty pig and hot scored like what? Yeah. Them shits are [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=612.32s)]
*  staring right at you. You know, it's just like in your face. Get Gary's economics on the stream. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=617.6s)]
*  Okay. Y'all are annoying. I, I think chat missed the point when you talk about liking these shows, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5-CmTwmmy4&t=623.6s)]
