# Israeli Security Cabinet Approves Ceasefire And Hostage Deal | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY)
*  then you should say the truth, which is that there was one party responsible for not agreeing to the conditions, Israel, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=0.0s)]
*  and Donald Trump, either through additional assurances to Benjamin Netanyahu in private correspondence, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=9.84s)]
*  or through directly threatening him, was able to force Benjamin Netanyahu to concede... [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=16.96s)]
*  The security cabinet approving the deal. What more can you tell us about what was worked out? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=23.88s)]
*  Well, the Israeli security cabinet did indeed just vote in favor of this agreement, voting that the full government, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  meaning the full cabinet of the Israeli prime minister's government, vote to approve this deal and put it in motion. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  And so we expect that that will be the next stage of the process here. In the next hour or two, most likely, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=51.88s)]
*  we will see the Israeli government likely approve this agreement. That will then set in motion this process, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=57.88s)]
*  where the Israeli Supreme Court will hear petitions from Israelis who have been impacted or who are victims of the crimes [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=63.88s)]
*  of these Palestinian prisoners who are set to be released. But that is largely a pro forma process. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=72.88s)]
*  The Israeli prime minister has enormous leeway to release those prisoners in a deal such as this. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=79.88s)]
*  And so it does appear, Fred, that everything is now on track for this ceasefire agreement to go into effect on Sunday. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=85.88s)]
*  We don't know exactly what time the ceasefire will start or what time those first hostages, three female civilian hostages, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=94.88s)]
*  we expect to be released on Sunday. We don't know exactly what time that will happen. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=104.88s)]
*  But it does appear as if finally, after quite a bit of uncertainty yesterday about the fate of the... [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=109.88s)]
*  You want to cringe and honor yourself? No, I'm not going to do that right now. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=116.88s)]
*  Important context on this deal. Yeah, Israel says its forces, not the Red Cross, will transport Palestinian prisoners released under Gaza, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=120.88s)]
*  under the Gaza deal to ensure Palestinians do not deviate from the strict security guidelines and refrain from any expressions of joy within Israeli territory. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=127.88s)]
*  Remember, this is important. This is what they did. This is what Itamar Ben-Gurver made the law. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=135.88s)]
*  Remember, during the brief truce in November 2023, Israeli police visited the homes of freed Palestinians in East Jerusalem, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=140.88s)]
*  and they were not able to refrain from any display of joy. During the November 2023 truce, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=145.88s)]
*  Itamar Ben-Gurver ordered Israeli police to use an iron fist to stop any Palestinian celebrations and said expressions of joy are equivalent to backing victory celebrations, give backing to those for those. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=151.88s)]
*  Yeah. If you celebrate your loved ones finally coming home, even though they were held hostage by the Israeli government, bro takes tweets as facts. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=161.88s)]
*  This is from Jeremy Scahill, a numerous time winning investigative reporter. What are you? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=171.88s)]
*  This man worked alongside someone else who's maybe fallen from grace in uncovering the truth about the NSA spying scandal. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=191.88s)]
*  Oh my God, dude. Reducing this to simply tweets is so funny. Quite telling that a number of Israeli troll accounts are claiming this post is false. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=212.88s)]
*  Perhaps they need to raise this issue with a notoriously pro-Hamas times of Israel. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=219.88s)]
*  Are you shocked? Yes, I am shocked. I'm shocked at the utter stupidity of people who fancy themselves to be intellectually superior to the hogs that they claim to hate. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=226.88s)]
*  Guys like this will regularly because they're like Reddit brain, right? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=237.88s)]
*  They honestly think that they're so much more intelligent than Trump supporters. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=242.88s)]
*  And yet when it comes to an issue where they have like where they've exhibited unimaginable bias, they are literally dumber. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=249.88s)]
*  They're dumber than the average Republican. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=257.88s)]
*  The ceasefire agreement here in Israel with a lot of political wrangling happening between the Israeli prime minister and his right wing governing coalition partners. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=262.88s)]
*  It does appear that at least now everything is back on track, that this ceasefire agreement is likely to be implemented on Sunday and that we are on the way for a six week ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=271.88s)]
*  One that will see the release of 33 hostages, hundreds of Palestinian prisoners released from Israeli jails, the entry of much needed humanitarian aid. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=283.88s)]
*  But it is important to note that until that moment, when that ceasefire goes into effect on Sunday, the very much still continuing in Gaza. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=292.88s)]
*  The Israeli military is continuing to drop inside of the Gaza Strip. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=301.88s)]
*  People are continuing to be more than 100 Palestinians have been since this ceasefire agreement was announced. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=305.88s)]
*  And so that is the tragedy of the moment. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=313.88s)]
*  Even as we are on our way better days and a moment of calm, six weeks of calm inside of the Gaza Strip. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=315.88s)]
*  Right now, people are still dying and the final victims of this until that ceasefire goes into place likely have not yet happened yet. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=323.88s)]
*  And so, Jeremy, you mentioned there's been a lot of political wrangling for the Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=332.88s)]
*  If this indeed goes through, gets the full support of the full body, the full cabinet, does this fortify his position or does this still reveal vulnerabilities for him? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=337.88s)]
*  It certainly does still reveal vulnerabilities. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=350.88s)]
*  And one of the most important vulnerabilities, Itamar Benkler, the National Security Minister, held a press conference last night where he said that he will indeed resign from the government alongside altogether six seats that he and his party hold in the Israeli Knesset, the Israeli Parliament. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=355.88s)]
*  If this ceasefire agreement is approved, and that is indeed what is happening right now, that means that Prime Minister Netanyahu's margin of majority in the Knesset is going to drop from eight seats to just two seats. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=370.88s)]
*  And then there's the question still of what is the finance minister, Betzel El Smotrich, going to do. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=384.88s)]
*  He and his party, who hold seven seats in the Knesset, have made clear that they will leave the government unless the Prime Minister provides them with assurances that Israel will go back to fighting in Gaza once the first phase of this agreement, meaning that six week ceasefire concludes. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=392.88s)]
*  And we don't yet know the extent of the assurances that the prime minister has provided Smotrich, whether in fact he will wait until the end of that six week period to decide whether or not to leave the government. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=411.88s)]
*  But certainly if the prime minister is listening to Smotrich and to his right wing political allies, then that will short circuit a process that is supposed to begin on the 16th day of the ceasefire. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=423.88s)]
*  And that is negotiations to extend that ceasefire and to ultimately bring about a permanent ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=434.88s)]
*  We know that that was the intention of the Biden administration to start this with a six week ceasefire, but that ultimately the hope being that negotiations could ultimately lead to a permanent ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and an end to the war as we know it today. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=444.88s)]
*  That is very, very much uncertain at this stage, given the political dynamics here in Israel. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=459.88s)]
*  All right, Jeremy Diamond. Thank you so, so much. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=465.88s)]
*  So once again, the deal has been approved by the security cabinet in Israel. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=468.88s)]
*  Now it goes to the full cabinet for a vote. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=472.88s)]
*  We do expect them to meet later on this hour. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=475.88s)]
*  And we're going to have much more on this later on in our program. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=477.88s)]
*  All right. Both President Biden and President elect Trump are taking credit for this ceasefire deal. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=481.88s)]
*  Take a listen. I told him what I was doing, what I thought could happen. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=488.88s)]
*  But what we did, we brought in the people or his going to be his national security people. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=493.88s)]
*  We brought them in closer to tell them what was happening as we hand this off. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=499.88s)]
*  We're so ungracious of Biden to say, oh, he did it. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=503.88s)]
*  He didn't do anything. If I didn't do this, if we didn't get involved, the hostages would never be out. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=506.88s)]
*  They would have never come out. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=511.88s)]
*  Yeah, this video, this part is really insane. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=515.88s)]
*  This Lawrence O'Donnell interview was so psychotic, but I guess it technically offers it. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=520.88s)]
*  Technically could be used as evidence. If we lived in a just world like Joe Biden's response to why [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=529.88s)]
*  Benjamin Nenya convinced them to use bunker busters in a just world would be used in a Nuremberg style trial. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=540.88s)]
*  Like actually, Joe Biden would be prosecuted alongside Benjamin Nenya and should. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=557.88s)]
*  But given the unlimited power that the American government has, even over international courts of justice, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=570.88s)]
*  it's you know, he just feels confident that he can say these things. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=578.88s)]
*  All right, let's bring in Margaret Taleb, senior contributor for Axio. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=583.88s)]
*  She's also the director of Institute for Democracy, Journalism and Citizenship at Syracuse University. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=587.88s)]
*  And he's joined us now from Washington, D.C. Great to see you. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=592.88s)]
*  So, all right, so at least the Israeli Security Council has agreed on this deal. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=595.88s)]
*  And now we're looking at this out loud kind of clarification of who helped get the deal this far, Biden or Trump. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=601.88s)]
*  Biden did say that this deal was one that he offered last May. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=608.88s)]
*  Trump's envoy was at the table. We heard Biden say he they invited them. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=613.88s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=625.88s)]
*  What? What is this guy saying? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=635.88s)]
*  Suck, fool, you lost. Oh, he's posting the Israeli flag and then the US flag. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=645.88s)]
*  I'm messaging my family in L.A. That's where my family lives. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=651.88s)]
*  My cousin said the air because they're safe, but the air quality is terrible. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=656.88s)]
*  Hi, Hassan, I hope you're having a good morning. How does this guy turn into? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=663.88s)]
*  Like a sociopath. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=669.88s)]
*  Damn, bro, we're going to talk about Palestine enough. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=673.88s)]
*  J.K. J.K. Love your channel and what you represent. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=678.88s)]
*  What happened? I'm unbanning this guy because I need to investigate his brain. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=683.88s)]
*  He went from like. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=689.88s)]
*  I love your channel, man, but like. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=693.88s)]
*  Israel, USA, USA, Israel. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=699.88s)]
*  Was the. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=703.88s)]
*  And to help collaborate. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=706.88s)]
*  So, I mean, I guess it's safe to say this is a unique transitional move. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=709.88s)]
*  Is it important, you know, who kind of gets the upper hand on credit? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=714.88s)]
*  If you are a hostage and you are going to get your freedom back, it matters 0 percent. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=721.88s)]
*  If you are. Joe Biden or Donald Trump, it apparently matters a lot. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=727.88s)]
*  And so I think, you know, Fred, what we're seeing here is sort of maybe not the best of politics, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=732.88s)]
*  but the way politics should work, which is that I think if you're in the media. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=737.88s)]
*  I think if you're a member of the media, it's important for you to. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=743.88s)]
*  I'm here. I used to be a medical technician. Yeah. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=749.88s)]
*  And don't don't ban this person. I want to investigate what happened that they're just like [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=751.88s)]
*  posting the Israeli flag and telling common people, soy boys or whatever. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=755.88s)]
*  I think if you're in the media, it does matter because your job is to. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=762.88s)]
*  Accurately report on what is going on. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=768.88s)]
*  And if that is your job, then you should say the truth, which is that there was one party [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=772.88s)]
*  responsible for not agreeing to the conditions. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=777.88s)]
*  Israel and Donald Trump either through additional assurances to Benjamin Netanyahu in private [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=782.88s)]
*  correspondence or through directly threatening him was able to force Benjamin Netanyahu to [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=789.88s)]
*  concede to the terms of the negotiation that they were supposed to say yes to all the way [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=796.88s)]
*  back in the month of June or July. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=803.88s)]
*  Which was initially written out and presented by Hamas all the way back in February. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=808.88s)]
*  I think it's ridiculous to just cast this aside as like petty disagreements between Donald [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=816.88s)]
*  Trump and and Brandon. Sure. Who cares? Oh, they're just trying to look for credit. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=821.88s)]
*  Your job in the news is to address what changed. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=828.88s)]
*  What changed? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=839.88s)]
*  Because the deal that is being implemented that Israel finally caved on after months [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=841.88s)]
*  of pushing it aside in an effort to continue and killing thousands of Palestinian women [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=859.88s)]
*  and children, elderly men. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=869.88s)]
*  There was one factor that changed in this process in this equation. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=873.88s)]
*  The election happened and Donald Trump became president. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=876.88s)]
*  I wish that we had a competent legacy media that would actually investigate these matters [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=882.88s)]
*  and try to figure out, for example, what assurances Trump may have given Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=889.88s)]
*  That's what journalism is about. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=894.88s)]
*  Right? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=896.88s)]
*  Was there was there a previous agreement that took place that would be in direct violation [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=898.88s)]
*  of American law where Donald Trump sidestepped the Biden administration and cut a side deal [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=913.88s)]
*  with Netanyahu to continue the. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=920.88s)]
*  That's another question I would ask if I was a journalist. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=922.88s)]
*  And last but not least, if that did happen, why did the Biden administration not do anything [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=925.88s)]
*  about it? Because they have an endless amount of power over Israel. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=931.88s)]
*  Knowing full well that maybe just maybe Donald Trump actually violated American law to cut [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=935.88s)]
*  a side deal with a foreign ally conducting this that the overwhelming majority of voters [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=943.88s)]
*  wanted to end. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=949.88s)]
*  Why did the Biden administration not do anything about it? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=951.88s)]
*  Why were they completely incapable of stopping Israel's offensive siege? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=954.88s)]
*  These would be the questions I would ask if I were a journalist. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=961.88s)]
*  Ironically enough, the reason why I am not a journalist is why I asked these questions, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=967.88s)]
*  because if you are a journalist and a legacy publisher, if you ask these questions, you [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=973.88s)]
*  are no longer a journalist and a legacy publisher. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=978.88s)]
*  That's the point. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=987.88s)]
*  Public servants in both parties come together to get something over the finish line. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=989.88s)]
*  And that's what we've seen with Brett McGurk, who is President Biden's longtime negotiator [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=993.88s)]
*  in the region. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=999.88s)]
*  And with Steve Wittkopf, he's a real estate developer, deeply involved in Donald Trump's [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1000.88s)]
*  inaugural, but also has been tapped as President-elect Trump's incoming envoy for the Middle East. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1006.88s)]
*  And we saw McGurk and Wittkopf kind of divide and conquer, take different meetings. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1012.88s)]
*  McGurk, sticking with the parameters of the deal that the Biden administration had been [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1016.88s)]
*  laying out and developing for months, and Wittkopf using his and Donald Trump's relationship [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1021.88s)]
*  with Bibi Netanyahu to be in the room while McGurk was on the phone. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1027.88s)]
*  Okay, that's all fine. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1030.88s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1031.88s)]
*  It seems to have worked. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1033.88s)]
*  But Trump saying he should get all the credit, Biden bristling over that, then Trump bristling [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1035.88s)]
*  because Biden bristled. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1042.88s)]
*  That's all politics. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1044.88s)]
*  It's a lot of politics. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1046.88s)]
*  And it's happening at this moment of transition. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1048.88s)]
*  We were talking a moment ago about the politics for Netanyahu in Israel. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1050.88s)]
*  But in the United States, obviously, this is a big political moment, the inauguration of [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1054.88s)]
*  Donald Trump on Monday. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1059.88s)]
*  And there are some echoes. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1061.88s)]
*  It's definitely not an exact parallel, but some echoes of that transition from Carter to Reagan. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1063.88s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I can't help but think of that. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1068.88s)]
*  Yeah, and the end of the Iran hostage crisis. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1070.88s)]
*  And it was a little bit different in that case. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1073.88s)]
*  But again, you know, it's a little bit different because Carter was incompetent. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1076.88s)]
*  But was still dealing with a foreign adversary. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1084.88s)]
*  Joe Biden wanted the war to continue and held all the cards to stop it and chose not to do so. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1089.88s)]
*  And I'll take it one step further, chose to lie actively at the behest of Israel as Israel [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1097.88s)]
*  undermined his influence, making a mockery of him. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1103.88s)]
*  And the reality of the matter is the media also played this song and dance as well and still [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1108.88s)]
*  continues to do so. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1113.88s)]
*  Whenever they talk about like, wow, how could Trump actually apply the right amount of pressure [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1115.88s)]
*  to Benjamin Netanyahu after Joe Biden tried for 15 months? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1119.88s)]
*  They're literally lying. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1124.88s)]
*  They know they know how easy it is for the American government to turn around and be like, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1126.88s)]
*  yeah, you're done. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1131.88s)]
*  Cut it out. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1132.88s)]
*  They know how easy it was for the American government without our weapons, Israel cannot [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1133.88s)]
*  continue killing these people. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1137.88s)]
*  Israel cannot defend itself without our weapons, without our surveillance. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1139.88s)]
*  You had secret British spy planes flying from Cyprus over Gaza to also on top of the American [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1146.88s)]
*  government. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1154.88s)]
*  You had secret British spy planes flying from Cyprus over Gaza to also on top of the American [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1155.88s)]
*  intelligence offer additional intelligence and strike targets to the Israeli occupying force. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1163.88s)]
*  This was a multifaceted, multinational approach. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1170.88s)]
*  This was not only supported, not only defended on the public stage, but like directly supported by [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1176.88s)]
*  numerous Western nations. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1182.88s)]
*  It's ridiculous that I can figure this out as a Twitch streamer sitting in West Hollywood. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1187.88s)]
*  But these major reporters seemingly are oblivious to that reality. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1193.88s)]
*  How could I so accurately down to the wire correctly predict exactly what was going to happen [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1198.88s)]
*  with the Trump administration from where I'm sitting? [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1204.88s)]
*  I don't have the gift of foresight. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1208.88s)]
*  I don't have, I'm not precogging it. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1213.88s)]
*  I don't have a particularly large brain. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1216.88s)]
*  I don't, I don't. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1219.88s)]
*  I'm not a very intelligent person. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1220.88s)]
*  So how come they can't do that? [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1225.88s)]
*  How come they can't apply a little bit of criticism, a little bit of critical thinking? [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1227.88s)]
*  Both presidents would like to take some credit for this. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1231.88s)]
*  And I think the truth is that it's not clear whether this deal would have gotten done on this timetable, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1234.88s)]
*  if not for the timing of the start of Trump's presidency. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1242.88s)]
*  But it's also true that Biden's team absolutely spent months working on the details of this. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1247.88s)]
*  And more broadly, it's true that this is not a United States. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1254.88s)]
*  This is a war between two other nations or governing groups. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1259.88s)]
*  True. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1263.88s)]
*  And there are many other factors at play that made a deal elusive and that are putting pressure for the deal now. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1264.88s)]
*  So it's sort of typical U.S. political strategy. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1272.88s)]
*  It's not a political strategy. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1277.88s)]
*  It's not a political strategy. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1279.88s)]
*  It's not a political strategy. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1281.88s)]
*  So it's sort of typical U.S. political egotism to make it seem like it's all about these two presidents and either one of them can claim the mantle. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1284.88s)]
*  But the bottom line is in a few days, this is going to be Donald Trump's situation, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1293.88s)]
*  the U.S.'s situation under the Trump administration to manage. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1299.88s)]
*  And President Biden will be former President Biden. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1303.88s)]
*  I hate this. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1309.88s)]
*  I hate this so much. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1315.88s)]
*  It's not interesting to say, oh, this deal was 15 months in the works. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1316.88s)]
*  That deal was already in the works. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1322.88s)]
*  We know that already. We know that. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1323.88s)]
*  We know that already. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1324.88s)]
*  What's interesting about it is why, which was the party that actually was involved that refused to refuse to sign off on the deal? [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1325.88s)]
*  Why did Biden not pressure the party that refuses to sign off on it? [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1334.88s)]
*  Why did Biden refuse to apply pressure to the party that did not sign off on it? [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1340.88s)]
*  But because they've started their position off of this lie that it was actually Hamas that was ruining the talks and not Israel when it was just truly untrue, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1345.88s)]
*  they have to maintain this lie over and over again. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1354.88s)]
*  All the while, I have to, I have to show you this. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1356.88s)]
*  The first time was probably [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1364.88s)]
*  when he moved really hard on the Philadelphia line and took out a hospital. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1375.88s)]
*  That's true. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1386.88s)]
*  And some of those guys were hiding underneath the hospital. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1388.88s)]
*  The thing about Hezbollah, about Hamas is they had all their facilities underneath schools, hospitals, churches. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1391.88s)]
*  I mean, yeah. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1400.88s)]
*  So you bro, you are such a piece of shit, dude. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1401.88s)]
*  Even after all of this countless damage has been done, this decrepit monster is still using the last remaining processing power he has in his mind before it shuts off to actively lie at the behest of the apartheid regime. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1406.88s)]
*  The rest of the apartheid genocidal state of Israel, like in his dying breath, he's gonna be like, I'm Israel hijack in his dying breath. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1420.88s)]
*  It started off with a lie, 40 beheaded babies, and it's still ending with a lie. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1428.88s)]
*  You had to get them. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1438.88s)]
*  You had to take people out. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1440.88s)]
*  Put this way. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1442.88s)]
*  I'll just say, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1445.88s)]
*  when I went to Israel, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1448.88s)]
*  immediately after their attack by Hamas, eight days later, whatever it was, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1451.88s)]
*  and I told them we were going to help, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1458.88s)]
*  I said, but Bibi, I said, you can't be carpet bombing these communities. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1461.88s)]
*  And he said to me, well, you did it. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1467.88s)]
*  You carpet bomb, not his exact words, but you carpet bomb Berlin. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1470.88s)]
*  You dropped a nuclear weapon. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1475.88s)]
*  You killed thousands of innocent people because you had to in order to win a war. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1477.88s)]
*  But that's why we came up with the UN. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1483.88s)]
*  New mess, new deals by which how what we how what we do relative civilians and military. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1486.88s)]
*  So he was. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1492.88s)]
*  Well, you did it. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1494.88s)]
*  So why can't I is a crazy childish way to approach this subject? [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1495.88s)]
*  I just know how much worse things are going to get under Donald Trump. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1501.88s)]
*  But every time I hear or see stuff like this coming from a prominent Democrat, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1504.88s)]
*  the previous administration's leader, I think to myself, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1509.88s)]
*  it is virtually unconscionable to vote this back into power to reward this. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1514.88s)]
*  This was the second term is so insane to me. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1519.88s)]
*  And I know the alternative is going to be worse. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1523.88s)]
*  So far, that's not the case, but it will be day one. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1525.88s)]
*  Just wait. I can't I just I don't know. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1529.88s)]
*  I don't know what to say about this. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1532.88s)]
*  Acceleration ism is so funny to say because it's the Democrats [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1534.88s)]
*  and their incompetence that is accelerating us towards fascism. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1537.88s)]
*  You can't say, whoa, acceleration ism. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1540.88s)]
*  When you hear me say this, when simultaneously the Democrats that were the party [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1543.88s)]
*  that were pushing on October 6th, one day before October 7, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1548.88s)]
*  a new bill that would actually fund the border wall. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1552.88s)]
*  And their message going into the election campaign was we are the border party. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1556.88s)]
*  The Republicans are actually incompetent and don't truly want a border wall. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1561.88s)]
*  Who do you think is accelerating America towards fascism? [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1565.88s)]
*  The supposed counterbalance to fascism that defends fascism, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1569.88s)]
*  to the nail or a Twitch streamer that wants the Democratic Party to be competent, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1573.88s)]
*  that wants the Democratic Party to be anti-fascist, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1578.88s)]
*  that cannot comprehend how far right they have become as they endlessly supported [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1582.88s)]
*  a genocide with our tax dollars. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1589.88s)]
*  It is it's insane, man. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1593.88s)]
*  It's insane. Just wait till just wait till you listen to what is justification [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1595.88s)]
*  that BB gave him was, which he basically summarized earlier. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1600.88s)]
*  Was comparing 21st century war tactics, battle tactics with World War II. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1604.88s)]
*  Well, what he was really doing is he was going after me for saying you can't indiscriminately [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1611.88s)]
*  bond civilian areas, even if the bad guys are there. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1618.88s)]
*  He was the bad guys there. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1622.88s)]
*  You can't take out two, 10, 12, 1500 people, innocent people in order to get the one bad guy. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1624.88s)]
*  And he made the legitimate argument. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1630.88s)]
*  His perspective, look, these are the guys that kill my people. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1632.88s)]
*  These are the guys that are all over in these tunnels. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1635.88s)]
*  Nobody had any idea the miles of tunnels are down there. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1638.88s)]
*  It's amazing what they built. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1642.88s)]
*  And they're sometimes 200 feet under the ground. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1644.88s)]
*  Well, the way to get to them is take out the places where they were under which under which they [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1647.88s)]
*  got to the tunnels. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1653.88s)]
*  And so that's the first time I had first time I had the discussion about bombing civilian areas was when I went over after the 9 11 after the. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1655.88s)]
*  That right there is an endorsement and an admission that is a direct violation of American laws and international human rights. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1671.88s)]
*  The president of the United States of America said that our foreign ally leadership told me, well, they're the bad guys. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1679.88s)]
*  They killed our people. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1685.88s)]
*  So I said, it's OK that you use bunker buster bombs on top of refugee camps, on top of hospitals, on top of schools where people were sheltering. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1687.88s)]
*  There was never a moment where Biden was at odds with Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1697.88s)]
*  Make no mistake. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1701.88s)]
*  That's precisely the reason why in spite of Benjamin Netanyahu routinely making a mockery of Joe Biden over and over again, very deliberately, as I covered every single day, day in, day out. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1703.88s)]
*  He still kept sending billions and billions of dollars of weapons. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1713.88s)]
*  OK, nonstop. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1716.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1718.88s)]
*  The massacre that occurred. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1719.88s)]
*  So on that first trip, 10, 11 days after October 7, you already raised the issues of how to get to a ceasefire. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1721.88s)]
*  Well, not a ceasefire. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1729.88s)]
*  How to prevent innocent death. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1731.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1733.88s)]
*  And then I pushed really, really hard for more humanitarian aid to go in and ways to get it. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1734.88s)]
*  And Bibi. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1741.88s)]
*  Look, in fairness to Bibi, he's got a tough coalition, too, man. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1746.88s)]
*  He's got the most conservative cabinet of any Israeli prime minister ever. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1750.88s)]
*  With that, did you have reason to believe that the prime dog that didn't materialize, he built it? [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1756.88s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1763.88s)]
*  What? [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1764.88s)]
*  He made the coalition. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1765.88s)]
*  Is this guy crazy? [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1767.88s)]
*  What's happening here? [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1768.88s)]
*  It's so wild to me that no one ever justifies left wing action this way. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1769.88s)]
*  Oh, we got a tight coalition here in the Democratic Party. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1776.88s)]
*  We got a lot of progressives in this slim minority. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1779.88s)]
*  We got slim margins here. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1782.88s)]
*  We got to abide by their wishes. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1784.88s)]
*  That never happens. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1786.88s)]
*  Tight coalitions and tiny margins only work in favor of the most far right elements. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1788.88s)]
*  Isn't that weird? [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1794.88s)]
*  Now I'm talking about American politics. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1795.88s)]
*  It's not even just Israeli politics. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1797.88s)]
*  Just in general, in the Western world, isn't it weird how slim majorities, tiny margins, and coalitions that are put together with like ideological opponents seemingly [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1799.88s)]
*  only seem to benefit the far right. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1812.88s)]
*  No one ever goes, well, the progressive caucus is a very important constituency, a very important coalition representing a very important constituency in the Democratic Party. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1815.88s)]
*  This is why we got to do Medicare for all murder gets legitimized when it's the left doing it. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1822.88s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1827.88s)]
*  There's a small chance that Trump is also Benjamin and Yahoo dog. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1828.88s)]
*  I don't think you understand why, why him posting sacks is crazy. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1832.88s)]
*  But aside from Trump posting sacks here, Donald Trump doesn't like Benjamin and Yahoo. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1839.88s)]
*  Okay. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1848.88s)]
*  Sure. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1849.88s)]
*  Fine. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1850.88s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1851.88s)]
*  What you have to understand here is that his own personal opinion of Benjamin and Yahoo is inconsequential because he loves the $100 million that he got from Miriam Adelson. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1852.88s)]
*  I don't think Trump likes Benjamin and Yahoo that much personally. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1868.88s)]
*  No American politician actually has ever liked Benjamin and Yahoo. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1872.88s)]
*  Many of them have routinely talked about how they hate him. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1876.88s)]
*  Actually, Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan, there are plenty. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1879.88s)]
*  It wasn't Reagan. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1883.88s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1884.88s)]
*  But I think I think it was Clinton that like actively talked about how he hated Netanyahu. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1885.88s)]
*  If I'm not mistaken. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1889.88s)]
*  So Barack Obama did not like Benjamin and Yahoo, like openly did not like Benjamin and Yahoo. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1891.88s)]
*  And Benjamin and Yahoo regularly undermined Barack Obama. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1897.88s)]
*  But once again, Barack Obama ended up giving Israel $38 billion in additional funds to defend itself on his way out. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1901.88s)]
*  Barack Obama, who once famously sat next to his two friends, Rashid Khalidi and Edward Said. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1912.88s)]
*  That Barack Obama, who Benjamin Netanyahu regularly shit on for being a black Muslim. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1919.88s)]
*  OK, that Barack Obama still ended up giving him $38 billion, giving Israel $38 billion in lethal aid. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1925.88s)]
*  OK, so you have to remember, regardless of the personal opinions that people have over Benjamin Netanyahu, and many American presidents have famously said he sucks. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1933.88s)]
*  What matters more is what they end up doing for Israel and what they end up doing for Israel is always going to be more weapons. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1945.88s)]
*  So here an open mic during last week's G20 summit caught President Obama and French President Nicolas Sarkozy complaining about Israel's prime minister, according to a report by Reuters. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1951.88s)]
*  I cannot bear Netanyahu. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1963.88s)]
*  He's a liar, said Sarkozy Obama, according to a French interpreter who is translating his remarks, replied. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1965.88s)]
*  You're fed up with him, but I have to deal with him even more often than you. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1972.88s)]
*  The president didn't exactly come to the defense of Netanyahu, whom he most recently saw at the UN in September. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1976.88s)]
*  It's not surprising, says Martin Indick, who served as U.S. ambassador to Israel during the Clinton and Bush administrations. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1982.88s)]
*  It reveals the inner feelings of the president towards Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1989.88s)]
*  I don't think it's any secret that these two leaders have not gotten on, basically, from their first meeting on. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=1996.88s)]
*  And an Oval Office encounter this past May further revealed the frosty relationship between the leaders. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2004.88s)]
*  While Israel is prepared to make generous compromises for peace, it cannot go back to the 1967 lines. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2010.88s)]
*  That would be a generous compromise for peace. What is he even saying? [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2018.88s)]
*  Netanyahu essentially lecturing a stern-faced President Obama. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2023.88s)]
*  Today, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney, in an off-camera briefing, would not comment on the open mic gaff. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2027.88s)]
*  He instead stressed the president's support of Israel, most recently in opposing a vote to give the Palestinian Authority membership in the UN's cultural agency, UNESCO, a move France supported. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2034.88s)]
*  America's commitment to Israel's security is unshakable. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2047.88s)]
*  It's an embarrassing incident, as both the U.S. and Israel keep a close eye on regime changes in the Middle East and on the growing threat of a nuclear Iran. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2051.88s)]
*  But, says Indick, it may have no real effect on U.S.-Israel relations. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2061.88s)]
*  It's on the line. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2066.88s)]
*  Yup. This news bit from, like, 2011 is literally just describing everything I just told you. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2067.88s)]
*  Like, I summarized basically every part of this news bit. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2073.88s)]
*  ...that these personality differences that have been highlighted by this mic that wasn't turned off are going to infect the coordination on Iran. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2077.88s)]
*  If you like, the subject is too serious to be affected by personalities. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2090.88s)]
*  They agree on the nature of the threat, and they also agree on the way to deal with it, that is by ratcheting up sanctions. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2095.88s)]
*  Of course, this does give ammunition to President Obama's critics, namely Republicans who... [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2103.88s)]
*  That's crazy. She's still at CNN. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2108.88s)]
*  ...who have said he hasn't backed Israel enough. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2111.88s)]
*  We've heard from the pro-Israel advocacy group, the Anti-Defamation League, expressing disappointment and saying this was an unpresidential exchange. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2114.88s)]
*  They say it was anti-Semitic. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2125.88s)]
*  ...of the war in Syria. And you may actually hear from grown-up reporters. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2127.88s)]
*  This is Jeffrey Sachs at Cambridge, by the way. He was there a week before me. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2134.88s)]
*  One more... [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2138.88s)]
*  This is literally from the talk he gave at Cambridge a week before I gave a talk at Cambridge, which is crazy. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2140.88s)]
*  This means I'm that much closer to Donald Trump. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2146.88s)]

*  Oh, the warrants intervened in Syria. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2152.88s)]
*  Well, do you know that the... that Obama tasks the CIA to overthrow the Syrian government? [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2155.88s)]
*  Starting four years before Russia intervened. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2161.88s)]
*  What kind of nonsense is that? [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2164.88s)]
*  And how many times did the New York Times report on Operation Timber-Sycamore, which was the presidential order to the CIA to overthrow Bashar al-Assad? [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2166.88s)]
*  Three times in ten years. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2175.88s)]
*  This is not democracy. This is a game. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2178.88s)]
*  And it's a game of narrative. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2181.88s)]
*  Why did the US invade Iraq in 2003? [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2183.88s)]
*  Well, first of all, it was completely phony pretenses. It wasn't, oh, we were so wrong. They didn't have weapons of mass destruction. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2188.88s)]
*  They actually did focus groups in the fall of 2002 to find out what would sell that war to the American people. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2196.88s)]
*  Dude, I love... I love putting conspiracy music, like the interstellar soundtrack, behind Jeffrey Sachs. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2204.88s)]
*  Because that's the only thing that hogs respond positively to. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2212.88s)]
*  I swear to God, if you were to translate like Lenin's speeches, and then, you know, obviously it can't be in... [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2216.88s)]
*  It can't be in any other language other than English. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2224.88s)]
*  And apparently Lenin learned English in an Irish accent, so maybe you could do that if you want. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2228.88s)]
*  This, with the likes of Jeffrey Sachs, like you're looking at an academic and a member of the state that like viciously destroyed the USSR initially, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2232.88s)]
*  but now is trying to atone for those sins at least a little bit. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2241.88s)]
*  And you have, as long as you slap it with a conspiracy sticker, like as long as you slap the conspiracy music to it, people are like, hell yeah, he's speaking truth. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2245.88s)]
*  Abe Shulsky, if you want to know the name of the PR genius. They did focus groups on the war. They wanted the war all the time. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2254.88s)]
*  They had to figure out how to sell the war to the American people, how to scare the shit out of the American people. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2264.88s)]
*  It was a phony war. Where did that war come from? You know what? It's quite surprising. That war came from Netanyahu, actually. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2269.88s)]
*  You know that? It's weird. And the way it is, is that Netanyahu had from 1995 onward the theory that the only way we're going to get rid of Hamas and Hezbollah [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2276.88s)]
*  is by toppling the governments that support them. That's Iraq, Syria, and Iran. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2288.88s)]
*  And the guy's nothing if not obsessive. And he's still trying to get us to fight Iran this day, this week. He's a deep, dark son of a bitch. Sorry to tell you. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2295.88s)]
*  Because he's gotten us into endless wars. And because of the power of all of this in the US politics, he's gotten his way. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2307.88s)]
*  I don't fully agree with that. I mean, I do agree that he's a deep, dark son of a bitch, but this is the one. This is a very commonly held perspective among many people that like the [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2316.88s)]
*  both his parties were taken out or at least like Iraq and Syria were always active targets at the behest of Israel. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2327.88s)]
*  And it was actually at Netanyahu's direction that we, you know, attack these places or whatever. I think especially as it pertains to Syria, like that played a role for sure. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2339.88s)]
*  I've said this before. I think like Bashar al-Assad was not only weak, but also was a tyrant. And outside of that, even the very fact that his weakness as a leader played a role in Syria being used as a logistical hub for Iran, connecting Iran to Lebanon in Syria, through Syria, connecting Iran to Lebanon so that they could offer weapons to the enemy. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2352.88s)]
*  And even manufacturer weapons and give it to Hezbollah. Having said that, I think America's interests in the region are set by Americans and not by Israel, not by Benjamin Netanyahu. Doesn't sound like a good return on investment for USA. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2382.88s)]
*  I think that even if it's not a good return on investment, it's still done for corporate interests. It's still done for weapons contracts. It's still done for oil. They think Arabs can't rise into a revolution. No, it's a conspiracy. The CIA did. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2397.88s)]
*  I mean, it's not a conspiracy to say that color revolution is a color revolution. They're often backed by the CIA and real public dissatisfaction with any kind of autocratic administration very quickly turns into something that destabilizes that country at the behest of American foreign policy objectives. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2411.88s)]
*  That much is 100% correct. And as a matter of fact, I would go so far as to say it's usually the case. Rarely do you ever have, rarely do you ever have a, the CIA doesn't have enough motion to instill dissatisfaction upon the public to the degree that there will be a real revolution in any country. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2430.88s)]
*  Right. They don't have that, which is why they will grab onto real points of contention. Like in Afghanistan, if it wasn't the Afghan government, the USSR aligned Afghan governments, genuine ineptitude and awful violence on the countryside against those who they consider to be radical Islamists. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2450.88s)]
*  If that had not taken place, then the CIA could not have actually armed and given people enough motion, like arm them, radicalize them and actively use them as a weapon against the Afghan government, which then of course obviously led to the USSR actually invading Afghanistan. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2472.88s)]
*  But that's the problem. It's a bit of both. It's always both. It never is born out of nothing. And sometimes it is born out of, I guess, nothing. And that's when it's ISIS. Okay. But it's very difficult. It's very difficult for America to create genuine resentment against a government out of nowhere. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2488.88s)]
*  Okay. And the only reason why ISIS could basically be cultivated and crafted was because of the prior destabilization that America had engaged in in the region. Okay. That's not out of nothing to be honest. Yeah, no, exactly. I'm saying that like ISIS in and of itself was not a popular movement or a popular mobilization. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2511.88s)]
*  Whereas color revolutions often do start as popular movements and popular mobilizations that the State Department takes advantage of and redirects towards a cause that benefits their destabilizing goals in the area, destabilizing goals in that nation, a foreign adversary. Okay. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2531.88s)]
*  And with respect to ISIS, there was no popular mobilization there at all. It's not a color revolution at all. And that's the reason why I basically stated that ISIS in and of itself was separate. But even then ISIS would never be able to exist in a country that wasn't destabilized already through prior destabilization efforts, through prior instances of war. Okay. That's why many in the region will be the first to tell you that ISIS is an American invention, understandably so. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2549.88s)]
*  But that war was totally phony. So what is this democracy versus dictatorship? Come on. This is these are not even sensible terms. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2578.88s)]
*  I am once again, very jealous that right-wingers openly get to do stuff like this and say stuff like this without any scrutiny whatsoever. It's very frustrating that Donald Trump can straight up post a Jeffrey Sachs video with conspiracy music on the background, where he just straight up posts a video of a conspiracy theory. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2589.88s)]
*  Which I don't even agree with, by the way. I don't even think he would fully agree with that sentiment either. I think it's a little bit reductive. But like, he can say that and not a single one of these like anti-Semitism defense institutions will turn around and get mad at that shit. But I can't even say Israel's an apartheid state without a bunch of motherfuckers coming at me and being like, that's the most anti-Semitic thing you've ever said, Hassan. I don't even think he would fully agree with that sentiment either. I think it's a little bit reductive. But like, he can say that and not a single one of these like anti-Semitism defense institutions will turn around and get mad at that shit. But I can't even say Israel's an apartheid state without a bunch of motherfuckers coming at me and being like, that's the most anti-Semitic thing you've ever said, Hassan. I don't even think he would fully agree [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2617.88s)]
*  How come right-wingers always have the unlimited amount of allotment? Like, how come they can do whatever they want? I feel like if we were to... He just said it, but you said he wouldn't agree with it. No, I'm saying I think he was explaining it in a very reductive way. I haven't really listened to his broader analysis, but I suspect that Jeffrey Sachs is not like Benjamin Netanyahu single-handedly is responsible for America invading Iraq and doing 9-11 truther. You're jealous that Trump has motion? Yes, bro. Yes, I'm jealous. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2647.88s)]
*  I'm jealous of his motion. I'm jealous that like, I swear to God, Donald Trump could literally bring about Medicare for all. Okay, he would never do it. But if there was one guy who could do it, it's him. And it's not just because he's the Teflon Don, it's also because he is a right-winger. Like, we are so captive to the whims of the right that a dictatorial right-winger could just be like, yeah, honestly, we're going to kill every Mexican, but also simultaneously [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2677.88s)]
*  you're getting free healthcare. And Americans would be like, all right, I guess I'm on board now. The very same Americans that be like, nah, that shit is gay as hell. If a Democrat was able to push it through, it would turn around and be like, no, I love that. Actually. Thank you so much. Look how gracious are and bountiful. Our Lord is. It's so goddamn annoying. If Trump does give Medicaid for all citizenship to illegals. Wait, what? And to illegals, will you support him? What he would do basically what Bismarck did in Germany and implement welfare in order to prevent the left from making any [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2707.88s)]
*  gains and bolsters on popularity. That's Jenks argument. Yeah, the difference is I don't believe that he's going to do that. It is also endlessly frustrating, though, because like it's frustrating because like I care about good things happening, right? I care about good things happening to American people. I want the government to be competent. I want the government to actually work at the behest of the citizens. Okay, I want the government to improve the material conditions of working class Americans. But it's endlessly frustrating that the only people that have any sort of like political, any sort of political [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2737.88s)]
*  freedom to do anything really are the Republican Party and their audience is so receptive to it because they're so personally invested in like the cult of Trump that they would be like, all right, I'm Medicare for all now. I'm actually in favor of Medicare for all now because my God King did it. If it was Obama pushing for it, they're like, oh, he wants to do gay communism health care. If I go to the doctor, the doctor told me gay. But when Trump is doing it, it's good. It's glorious. My King Minister was delaying. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2767.88s)]
*  I'm not saying that he would never do that. No, make no mistake. I'm not delusional. I'm simply annoyed that if he were to do that, that would be the only time it's allowed. That's what's annoying. It's like, it's maybe even doubly annoying that he does have the [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2797.88s)]
*  capacity to do that because he has motion, but he won't. Of course he won't because he's a piece of shit. Part of the reason why he wanted to begin with. Do you not see what I'm saying? You're saying only Nixon could go to China. I mean, I guess to a certain degree. Yeah. That's that's what I mean. Yeah. I'm so annoyed that. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2817.88s)]
*  I'm so annoyed that the Republicans are bound by a cult like affirmation, which gives the Republican Party unlimited bandwidth to actually do things that would expend political capital. But then even though they have that allotment, they waste it or not wasted, but like, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

*  a ceasefire, and also maybe saving Tic TOC, which you know, we'll see if he's actually [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ZCWmPjiLY&t=2871.5s)]
