# Warning About The Rise Of The Far-right In Germany | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc)
*  Look at her cute blonde pigtails. Come over. Wiedergutmachungsabkommen. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=0.0s)]
*  The Schweinebraten is ready in the oven. The Wiedergutmachungsabkommen was our post [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=6.0s)]
*  war reparations agreement. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=11.86s)]
*  Bro, NetzDG is like supposed to be the anti hate speech statute in Germany. It is so [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=13.96s)]
*  difficult to say. It's like Netzwerk zygotebejaboodaboodaboo. I have no idea how to say it. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=21.959999999999997s)]
*  NetzDG with Israel. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=31.159999999999997s)]
*  I've never liked calling too much attention to today's date. February. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=38.56s)]
*  Anyway, Mitch McConnell is retiring finally. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=45.2s)]
*  Even though he's like a million years old, one of the most successful US politicians ever. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=51.64s)]
*  It's correct. You are right. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=55.92s)]
*  I wish you weren't right, but you are. Can you give a trigger warning before showing Mitch on screen? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  Yes. But before we get to Mitch, let's talk about Germany's far right comeback from the New York Times. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=63.440000000000005s)]
*  And then we'll we'll get to Mitch in a second. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=70.36s)]
*  It's saving, according to Elon Musk. But don't worry. We know what we are doing and we know who we are. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=73.92s)]
*  We are Germans. We are good at inventing long, complicated words. And we are really cool and relaxed. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=81.88s)]
*  But of course, there's something else that inventing Germany may have lost one or two world wars, but we [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=89.04s)]
*  successfully turned it into a win. And we became Vergangenheitsbewältigungsweltmeister. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=97.2s)]
*  We are world champions at confronting our history. A title we've [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=105.84s)]
*  I don't know if I would agree to that. I think it's not even like recent acts. I mean, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=110.6s)]
*  every German can turn around and say says you to me right now, because I live in America. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=116.28s)]
*  Okay. Oh, he's not for 80 years in a row. We won this title by virtue signaling. But with a German twist, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=122.2s)]
*  we are not just signaling virtue to others, but also to our own guilty conscience. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=130.4s)]
*  Living in Germany means being constantly reminded of our past. Every [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=136.56s)]
*  It's satire. Excuse me. I've never seen a German try to do comedy before. Okay, give me a break. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=141.6s)]
*  Literally the most autistic nation on the planet, with the exception of Japan. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=148.72s)]
*  Every day 24 seven for now 80 years, we've been telling ourselves never again. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=153.6s)]
*  Remembrance of the Holocaust is everywhere in Germany, a country stacked with memorials, memorials, memorials, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=160.68s)]
*  memorials, just in case we forget to never forget. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=168.04000000000002s)]
*  Unfortunately, Never Again didn't come with a manual on how to Never Again. Our German extreme [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=172.9s)]
*  right party, the AFD, is projected to win almost every fifth vote in our national election this February. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=180.20000000000002s)]
*  The party is called the Alternative für Deutschland, which literally means [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=187.72s)]
*  alternative for Germany. And they will probably become the second largest party in German parliament, out of around half a dozen. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=193.62s)]
*  Here is what one of the AFD's leading figures thinks of German Never Again. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=201.95999999999998s)]
*  Björn Höcke is the [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=212.35999999999999s)]
*  history teacher that's the straight up. He is a [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=215.39999999999998s)]
*  I know it's subtle, but AFD's Björn Höcke might sound a bit [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=224.67999999999998s)]
*  Hitleresque, which is French for slightly concerning. Höcke recently won a state election in eastern Germany, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=229.78s)]
*  securing the first far-right win in a state election since World War II. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=236.84s)]
*  He, by the way, can legally be called a f***ist, as the German court has ruled in one case. So, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=241.0s)]
*  should the rest of the world be worried about a big German f***ist comeback? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=247.48000000000002s)]
*  Yes, you should be worried. Let me explain [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=256.68s)]
*  why. And since I'm German, my explanation, of course, will be pointlessly complicated and [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=260.92s)]
*  inspiringly brutal, like our traditional German bedtime stories. For instance, the one about a boy named Konrad, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=266.2s)]
*  who wouldn't stop sucking his thumbs until they were cut right off, just for [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=273.15999999999997s)]
*  educational purposes, of course. So the AFD [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=278.68s)]
*  Brothers Grimm, dude, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=283.08s)]
*  genuinely the most freakish shit. Yo, I swear when you when you learn about German history and German culture, you understand how that happened. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=284.91999999999996s)]
*  Also, also, that's the reason why I was like Germans are incapable of making a joke. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=293.24s)]
*  That's why I was shocked when the guy was being sarcastic and joking. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=298.84s)]
*  Isn't AFD also pro-Israel though? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=315.96s)]
*  And now they are twisting the truth by hijacking our world-renowned beautiful German language. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=323.0s)]
*  A speck of bird shit in German history. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=332.84s)]
*  That's what one of the AFD's founders called Germany's past, meaning the whole [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=336.36s)]
*  was just a speck of bird shit in our overall successful history. Success, of course, meaning constantly losing world wars. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=342.04s)]
*  So far. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=351.48s)]
*  When Elon Musk, the man who would never salute, recently interviewed AFD's chairwoman Alice Weidel on X, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=355.08000000000004s)]
*  she gave another vibrant example on how AFD mastered blatant truth twisting. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=362.04s)]
*  The biggest success after that terrible era [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=367.96000000000004s)]
*  in our history was [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=372.6s)]
*  to label Adolf Hitler as right and conservative. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=375.16s)]
*  He was exactly the opposite. He wasn't a conservative. He wasn't a libertarian. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=380.38s)]
*  He was a communist socialist guy. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=387.02000000000004s)]
*  Amazing. Yeah. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=392.86s)]
*  Night of the long knives as left is infighting. You know how the left is. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=395.5s)]
*  180 degree turn around from the truth. Let's try. But these obvious little rhetorical tricks are. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=400.22s)]
*  It's so funny because they're like [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=408.62s)]
*  holding onto a position simultaneously where they're saying like Adolf Hitler was bad because he was a socialist, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=411.02s)]
*  but also he was misunderstood and not that bad. Great. Okay. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=417.26s)]
*  Mike, how the fuck does that make any sense? Actually effective. Thanks to one special German way to cope with our past. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=422.3s)]
*  Geschichtsvergessenheit. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=430.06s)]
*  Geschichtsvergessenheit means actively forgetting our, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=432.3s)]
*  let me put it this way, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=436.38s)]
*  ambiguous past despite the endless memorials. Because honestly having to confront your own history [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=438.03999999999996s)]
*  can be really really exhausting for us Germans. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=444.78s)]
*  But Geschichtsvergessenheit is not a concept the AFD just recently invented. In 1952, for instance, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=447.9s)]
*  Konrad Adenauer, one of the founding fathers of our modern democratic Germany, signed a [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=455.02s)]
*  a reparations agreement. Yet another beautiful accessible German word. And did you know also a pretty common girl's name in Bavaria? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=463.4s)]
*  Ah, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=471.41999999999996s)]
*  there's little [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=472.53999999999996s)]
*  upcom was our post-war reparations agreement. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=484.78s)]
*  Bro, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=488.78s)]
*  NetzDG is like supposed to be the anti-haste breach statute in Germany. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=490.29999999999995s)]
*  It is so fucking difficult to [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=495.58s)]
*  say. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=498.85999999999996s)]
*  It's like Netzwerk, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=500.38s)]
*  zygosebegebegebeudebeudebeu. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=501.97999999999996s)]
*  I have no idea how to say it. NetzDG. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=504.61999999999995s)]
*  With Israel, but most modern democratic Germans have conveniently forgotten Adenauer's real motives. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=507.26s)]
*  The power of the Jews, even today. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=514.78s)]
*  Especially in America, you should not underestimate. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=518.6999999999999s)]
*  And that's why I thought a lot and was very conscious. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=522.86s)]
*  And that was, in my opinion, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=527.98s)]
*  my whole effort. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=530.78s)]
*  As good as it was for a... [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=533.5799999999999s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=535.8199999999999s)]
*  He said the Jews are a [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=537.66s)]
*  too powerful of a force to be reckoned with. That's why we had to do reparations. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=539.74s)]
*  In other words, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=544.78s)]
*  beware. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=550.22s)]
*  The Jews are still powerful, even though we try to kill them all. So from now on, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=551.3399999999999s)]
*  we better be nice to them. And then all is wieder gut again. Thank you, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=557.18s)]
*  Konrad Adenauer, but never really went away in both Germanys. In the 2000s, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=562.9399999999999s)]
*  the German's [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=569.34s)]
*  inter-race group [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=570.86s)]
*  at least 10 people. Their racist crimes continued for years because the German public and [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=572.86s)]
*  that neo-Nazis could be responsible. Instead, they just publicly blamed immigrants for supposedly killing each other. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=577.42s)]
*  Why are we Germans so blatantly dismissive towards the collective affection for the far right? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=584.86s)]
*  Partly because in Germany, there's a discrepancy between collective memory and [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=590.62s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. This is probably the most radical [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=595.66s)]
*  criticism of Germany that you're going to hear even in terms of like their commitment and allegiance to Israel like this. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=600.14s)]
*  Like I'm actually kind of shocked. Like I'm sure this guy is not [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=607.42s)]
*  anti-Zionist or whatever, but it's like kind of shocking that here comes the anti-Deutsche Jan [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=611.74s)]
*  Boer Boemerman. I suspect that he is, I suspect that he much like every other prominent German [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=619.1s)]
*  is probably [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=626.86s)]
*  super lived up and super [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=628.7800000000001s)]
*  super Zionist, but [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=632.1400000000001s)]
*  and [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=634.1400000000001s)]
*  individual guilt. We acknowledge our grim past never again yada yada yada, but our ancestors like [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=635.1s)]
*  personally our families ourselves, we had nothing to do with it whatsoever. Yes, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=642.9399999999999s)]
*  my great grandfather was in the Waffen SS, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=650.38s)]
*  but he was a cook and the lasagna he made in Stalingrad tasted like Schuhsollenauflauf. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=653.5s)]
*  So basically he tried to destroy the Waffen SS from within. Where's his memorial? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=660.4599999999999s)]
*  By virtue signaling to our own guilty conscience, we got rid of our Nazi past. Germans have sworn [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=665.42s)]
*  does he extend this to Islamophobia or even like endless support to Israel too? Because he's 100% [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=672.62s)]
*  nailing the fake virtue signaling aspect of [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=680.06s)]
*  I think as far as what I've seen like the German collective consciousness surrounding [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=687.18s)]
*  the Holocaust and these war crimes and the atrocities during World War II and how like [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=692.54s)]
*  modern Germany reflects on it, it's very interesting to hear a German say these sorts of things. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=697.5s)]
*  It also does play a way like a comfortable narrative to claim that Islamophobia is valid [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=704.2199999999999s)]
*  and also modern anti-Semitism does not come from the Germans, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=712.9399999999999s)]
*  but it comes from anti-Israel sentiment which Muslims are trafficking. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=717.66s)]
*  We've gone to never again so many times that it became an empty phrase and when a new right-wing leader [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=721.18s)]
*  calls for a 180 degree turnaround on never again, we also don't take it seriously because [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=727.9s)]
*  it somehow feels empty as well because no matter what we do, Germans can't be Nazis again. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=735.7399999999999s)]
*  That's the space in which the AFD operates. They can say and do Nazi things as long as they [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=743.9s)]
*  aggressively deny that anyone was ever a Nazi. It's like giving the Hitler salute in front of [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=750.38s)]
*  a large crowd of right-wing extremists while denying being a Nazi. It's a narrative that [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=756.62s)]
*  seems to be successful all over the world. We aren't Nazis, we just don't fully support liberty, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=765.42s)]
*  equality and the rule of law. We aren't Nazis, we just want white supremacy. The AFD is not the new [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=770.86s)]
*  Nazi party, they just want Germany to be great again and that's why now in Germany the kakka [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=777.66s)]
*  is amdampfen. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=785.42s)]
*  That was great. I'm shocked but like I said of course he's pro-Israel. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agwXy0YSzc&t=794.54s)]
