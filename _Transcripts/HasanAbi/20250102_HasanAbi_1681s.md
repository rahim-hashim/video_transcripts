# Revealing Palestinian Perspectives On Israel | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA)
*  Like I know this lady gives the best hugs and makes bomb food but this is also the exact representation of how all my older Jewish relatives think? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=6.16s)]
*  That's why I'm saying that like, I'm sure that she is otherwise not a f***ing psychopath. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=6.66s)]
*  You know? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=14.0s)]
*  Like, Ukrainians are n****s? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=14.5s)]
*  What? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=16.8s)]
*  No one actually believes that, I don't think. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=17.3s)]
*  That's like, a really shitty justification at best. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=20.0s)]
*  Where are the civilians? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=23.2s)]
*  Civilians have been killing Gaza, from what you know. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=28.2s)]
*  Who gives a f***? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=30.8s)]
*  Okay, but don't you feel like, for example, children? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=31.799999999999997s)]
*  Children grow up to be Arabs. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=34.4s)]
*  Do you know how many prisoners were killed in Gaza? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=36.8s)]
*  No, it's a good question. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=40.0s)]
*  Maybe not? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=41.6s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=42.9s)]
*  Can I ask why? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=43.4s)]
*  Because I don't think there's anyone who killed one of those prisoners. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=44.6s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=47.1s)]
*  Do you know how many prisoners were killed in Gaza? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=48.1s)]
*  It's so funny seeing these like, otherwise lovely old ladies that look like they're probably [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=51.0s)]
*  kind to their immediate family members say such unrestricted Nazi style politics. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=59.5s)]
*  Like, demonstrate such rapacious, s***-assist, n***ity attitudes. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=68.6s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=74.3s)]
*  Like, you wouldn't expect this person to be the second coming of Adolf Hitler from afar. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=75.3s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=83.1s)]
*  You'd be like, oh, that's a lovely old grandma. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=83.7s)]
*  It's a lovely aunt. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=86.6s)]
*  And the lovely aunt is like, yeah, we should execute every child. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=88.0s)]
*  We should keep the adults around and just kill all the children instead, because then [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=92.7s)]
*  we'll teach the adults a lesson. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=99.4s)]
*  Because the adults, the children will become adults anyway. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=101.8s)]
*  Longer clip from the first woman here. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=104.8s)]
*  Civilians have been killing Gaza, from what you know. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=107.8s)]
*  Who gives a s***? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=110.3s)]
*  Okay, but don't you feel like, for example, children? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=111.3s)]
*  Children grow up to be Arabs. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=114.3s)]
*  I shouldn't say this. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=116.3s)]
*  I know, I read the numbers last week. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=118.3s)]
*  My memory died and went to heaven. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=120.3s)]
*  I don't think children should suffer, but there are always casualties. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=122.3s)]
*  And since they do a lot of purvoo, that is a natural result. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=127.3s)]
*  You know, those Arabs, they breed like rabbits and infestation. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=131.8s)]
*  Do you understand why the world is so angry? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=136.3s)]
*  Because they keep seeing so... [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=139.3s)]
*  Overall, overall, overall, the world. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=140.3s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=146.3s)]
*  This person even recognizing that the world is angry, puts her as like one of the more [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=146.8s)]
*  progressive members of Israeli society. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=154.3s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=156.3s)]
*  I was going to say, I'm suspecting that she will say it's because they're s***metic. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=156.8s)]
*  Or like, the talking tree here, okay, the dialogue tree goes into two directions here. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=160.8s)]
*  Why do you think the world is angry then? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=168.3s)]
*  Anti-Semitism is the, you know, average hardliner position. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=170.3s)]
*  Or they just simply don't understand the living conditions that we have here with Arabs. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=175.3s)]
*  Does not really understand what's going on here. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=180.3s)]
*  They do not understand, Grace, the concept that Israel was attacked. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=184.3s)]
*  And Palestinians, there is no such thing as Palestinians. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=188.8s)]
*  There are Arabs who have many countries to flee to and nobody wants them to. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=193.8s)]
*  But if we do call them Palestinians, their parents use them as human shields to gain sympathy. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=198.8s)]
*  The natural instinct of a Jewish mother is to protect her child. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=206.8s)]
*  Palestinian women do not have that. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=210.8s)]
*  How do you know this? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=214.8s)]
*  From years of living here. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=215.8s)]
*  Can you give an example of something you've seen? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=218.3s)]
*  As I said, my memory died and went to heaven. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=220.3s)]
*  But I read newspapers every single day and I've read many different stories where the woman took her child and put her in front. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=222.3s)]
*  And then she thought this is going to gain sympathy with her readers around the world. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=232.3s)]
*  And it does. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=238.3s)]
*  Is this real? I find it really hard to believe that people are this plainly evil. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=240.3s)]
*  Dude, this doesn't register as evil in her mind. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=243.3s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=246.3s)]
*  That's what's so... [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=247.8s)]
*  This is what people don't ever comprehend. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=248.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=251.8s)]
*  From where we're standing, we hear this lady say some of the most horrible things and we are shocked. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=252.8s)]
*  In her mind, she thinks this is the most normal thing you could say. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=257.8s)]
*  Like, do you think supporters of the Nazi government and Nazi Germany were like, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=262.8s)]
*  Oh yeah, we love killing Jewish people because it's awesome, because we're bad. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=268.8s)]
*  No, they thought Jewish people were evil and scary monsters. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=275.3s)]
*  There is always a cycle of propaganda that must justify the horrifying actions that the state takes. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=280.3s)]
*  There is so much literature on this. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=288.3s)]
*  There is so much research dedicated to how, oftentimes, also conducted by Jewish scholars, Jewish academics as well. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=290.3s)]
*  Many of which also are not exactly supporters of Israel either. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=301.8s)]
*  Literally the only other half of it. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=304.8s)]
*  Brother Jewish grandparents are notorious for the most loving and kindest people you will meet and make bomb ass food and will always keep you fed majority of the time. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=306.8s)]
*  Like, I know this lady gives the best hugs and makes bomb food, but this is also the exact representation of how all my older Jewish relatives think. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=312.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=318.8s)]
*  That's why I'm saying that, like, I'm sure that she is otherwise not a fucking psychopath. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=319.8s)]
*  You know? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=326.8s)]
*  Like, Ukrainians or Nazis? What? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=327.8s)]
*  No one actually believes that, I don't think. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=330.3s)]
*  That's like a really shitty justification at best. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=332.3s)]
*  That I don't even know if Russians believe that. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=336.3s)]
*  I'm sure there are some Russians who do. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=339.3s)]
*  But yeah, she does not consider what she's saying to be evil. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=341.3s)]
*  Okay? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=346.3s)]
*  In the same way that, like, the average Nazi Germany supporter, the average Nazi supporter in Germany, did not consider the government to be evil. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=347.3s)]
*  At most, they considered it to be a necessary evil. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=356.8s)]
*  That's just an H3 fan who saw the episode where they're a Ukrainian correspondent. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=360.8s)]
*  What? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=363.8s)]
*  It's gotta be, it's gotta be really funny if you come in here and you're like, but you think every Ukrainian is a Nazi and I'm like, I don't think that. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=364.8s)]
*  I've never thought that at all. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=372.8s)]
*  I don't know where you're getting this information. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=374.8s)]
*  I wonder if that causes people to go, hmm, let me reconsider my position. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=376.8s)]
*  Like, no, I don't believe that at all. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=383.3s)]
*  Let's see what this lady has to say. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=386.3s)]
*  It seems like a lot of people who don't like you do that, where they will deliberately misrepresent your position, even if you tell them that's not what you're saying to their face. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=394.3s)]
*  It's so strange. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=403.3s)]
*  It's such a strange thing to say. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=405.3s)]
*  Anyway. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=407.3s)]
*  New York Post did a stage tour of the NOLA Attackers songs, like a 1-1 comparison with your average Israeli propaganda video where they talk about the calendar, like as a hit list. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=413.3s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know exactly what Corey Gilshuster's own personal opinion on Israel is, but I have watched his videos before and they are very interesting. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=425.3s)]
*  Do you know how many people were killed in Gaza? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=439.8s)]
*  No, that doesn't interest me. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=443.8s)]
*  No? Why? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=445.8s)]
*  It doesn't interest me. I was there until October 7th. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=447.8s)]
*  It's amazing how much the Nazis are rising up in popularity in Germany right now. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=469.8s)]
*  And also, it is so patently ahistorical. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=473.8s)]
*  For the past 25 months that you've subscribed, where you're just like not paying attention, anytime I've talked about German politics immediately in the aftermath of World War II, and what, like what German governance looked like, the Nazis were instantly brought back to power. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=477.8s)]
*  It's the first example to point to in terms of comparing it to Zionism. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=494.3s)]
*  In Shalom, in Shia, in Tushia, after that I understood that everyone is a war hero. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=497.8s)]
*  To my regret, it's bad. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=503.8s)]
*  But kids? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=504.8s)]
*  I said yes, it doesn't interest me. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=505.8s)]
*  Do you know how many people were killed in Gaza? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=507.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=510.8s)]
*  How many? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=511.8s)]
*  How many are killed? 35? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=512.8s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=515.8s)]
*  I am actually in the UN, it's less. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=516.8s)]
*  16,000. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=518.8s)]
*  16,000. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=519.8s)]
*  Do you understand why the world is against Israel? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=522.8s)]
*  Yes, of course. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=527.3s)]
*  So what can you do? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=528.3s)]
*  Not to relate, to just enter the battle. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=529.3s)]
*  Like to throw a couple on the side, how they are [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=533.3s)]
*  how they are. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=536.1999999999999s)]
*  There will be a couple that is there. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=538.1999999999999s)]
*  Do you know how many people were killed in Gaza? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=540.1999999999999s)]
*  No, so I can't stop. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=543.1999999999999s)]
*  Maybe not. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=545.1999999999999s)]
*  Good. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=546.1999999999999s)]
*  Can I ask why? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=547.1999999999999s)]
*  Because I don't think there is anyone who killed anyone. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=548.1999999999999s)]
*  But kids, let's say. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=551.1999999999999s)]
*  The kids are poor, I have no doubt. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=554.6s)]
*  But they didn't want to be children, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=558.6s)]
*  who are afraid of people. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=562.2s)]
*  Oh, it's sad though. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=564.2s)]
*  Sadly, all those kids are going to do murder. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=566.2s)]
*  Education, in my opinion, everything starts with education. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=570.2s)]
*  And if education is a problem... [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=573.2s)]
*  Projection. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=575.2s)]
*  The assumption that Palestinians need to be taught in school [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=576.2s)]
*  to hate Israel is projection. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=579.2s)]
*  Projection that Israelis actually need to be taught to hate Palestinians [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=582.2s)]
*  through every orifice of Israeli society, Israeli culture, and Israeli education. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=586.2s)]
*  It's pure projection. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=592.2s)]
*  Palestinians learn to hate Israel not in school. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=594.2s)]
*  Palestinians learn to hate Israel when Israel bombs the school. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=597.2s)]
*  When Israel bombs your house. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=602.2s)]
*  When Israel bombs and kills your immediate family members. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=605.2s)]
*  And that's an understandable anger that people have. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=609.2s)]
*  So that's why a lot of this kind of, you know, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=613.2s)]
*  oh, they're being taught to hate Jews or whatever the fuck is very silly. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=617.2s)]
*  If there is no way that education will be only to kill Jews or hate Jews, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=639.2s)]
*  then there will be a change. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=645.2s)]
*  The situation is still the same as it is today. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=647.2s)]
*  Sadly, the situation is not the same. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=649.2s)]
*  Do you know how many children were killed in Gaza? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=651.2s)]
*  15,000? 20,000? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=654.2s)]
*  It's about 40,000. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=656.2s)]
*  40,000, okay. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=658.2s)]
*  And you understand why the world is angry about Israel? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=659.2s)]
*  Yes, I understand. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=662.2s)]
*  Because they think there is genocide here. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=664.2s)]
*  And what do you think? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=666.2s)]
*  I think that whoever was here, whoever visited here, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=667.2s)]
*  has no right to speak, first of all. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=671.2s)]
*  Whoever experienced what... [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=674.2s)]
*  You gotta come taste the genocide in order to have an opinion on it, you know? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=676.2s)]
*  I don't think there is any country in the world that is throwing missiles, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=680.2s)]
*  that is carrying out attacks in the country, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=683.2s)]
*  that is like this on the right and left. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=686.2s)]
*  There is no right side and no wrong side. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=689.2s)]
*  In general, Israel is more innocent because we are not looking for death. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=691.2s)]
*  We don't want to die. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=696.2s)]
*  We want to live in peace. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=697.2s)]
*  We made peace with Syria, with Egypt, with Jordan. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=699.2s)]
*  We didn't make peace with Syria, but okay, not yet. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=704.2s)]
*  As the saying goes, as long as we assume we will be destroyed, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=709.2s)]
*  Israel will not be destroyed. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=712.2s)]
*  As long as they assume they will be destroyed, there will be peace. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=713.2s)]
*  How many civilians have been killed in Gaza? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=715.2s)]
*  Who gives a shit? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=718.2s)]
*  Okay, but don't you feel like, for example... [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=720.2s)]
*  I wonder if that applies for us Americans who are funding this thing we can't talk about. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=722.2s)]
*  I mean, dude, the reality is, America Post 9-11, you know, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=726.2s)]
*  if you ask them, should we kill every Muslim on the planet? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=731.2s)]
*  There's a button in the press to kill every Muslim on the planet. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=735.2s)]
*  You'd be shocked at the results. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=737.2s)]
*  Every country has some, I wouldn't say universal moral principles, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=740.2s)]
*  but most people operate in a similar framework, you know? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=746.2s)]
*  That's it. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=750.2s)]
*  Children? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=751.2s)]
*  Children grow up to be Arabs. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=752.2s)]
*  I shouldn't say this. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=754.2s)]
*  I know, I read the numbers last week. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=756.2s)]
*  My memory died and went to heaven. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=758.2s)]
*  I don't think children should suffer, but there are always casualties. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=760.2s)]
*  And since they do a lot of purvoo, that is a natural result. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=765.2s)]
*  Do you understand why the world is so angry? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=769.2s)]
*  Because they keep seeing so... [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=771.2s)]
*  Overall, the world does not really understand what's going on here. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=774.2s)]
*  They do not understand, Grace, the concept that Israel was attacked. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=782.2s)]
*  And Palestinians, there is no such thing as Palestinians. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=787.2s)]
*  There are Arabs who have many countries to flee to and nobody wants them to. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=791.2s)]
*  But if we do call them Palestinians, their parents use them as human shields to gain sympathy. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=797.2s)]
*  The natural instinct of a Jewish mother is to protect her child. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=805.2s)]
*  Palestinian women do not have that. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=809.2s)]
*  How do you know this? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=813.2s)]
*  From years of living here. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=814.2s)]
*  Can you give an example of something you've seen? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=816.2s)]
*  As I said, my memory died and went to heaven. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=818.2s)]
*  But I read newspapers every single day. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=820.2s)]
*  I've read many different stories where the woman took her child and put her in front. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=822.2s)]
*  And then she thought this is going to gain sympathy with her readers around the world. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=830.2s)]
*  And it does. It is successful for them. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=836.2s)]
*  Do you know how many civilians have been killed in Gaza? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=839.2s)]
*  I know the rumor is talking about 50,000. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=842.2s)]
*  I know. I am also informed that the formal number is a little lower than that. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=846.2s)]
*  The formal number is around 42 now. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=852.2s)]
*  That's the last I heard. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=854.2s)]
*  Do you understand why the world is angry? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=855.2s)]
*  At us? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=857.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=858.2s)]
*  But I think they are wrong and I can actually explain. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=859.2s)]
*  Explain? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=861.2s)]
*  I think that basically the terror regime in Gaza and all the countries around us, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=862.2s)]
*  they also govern the people and they also deny them from aid, first of all. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=870.2s)]
*  They also kept hostages in Gaza by the Hamas. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=877.2s)]
*  Because basically the Hamas won't let them leave because they are living targets. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=881.2s)]
*  So I think, I do want to... [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=885.2s)]
*  Meaning if they... [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=888.2s)]
*  Sorry, but not from us. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=889.2s)]
*  So meaning if they were allowed to leave to go to Egypt, let's say, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=890.2s)]
*  because Israel is not going to take them in, obviously. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=893.2s)]
*  So if they were allowed to go to Egypt, Egypt would let them... [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=895.2s)]
*  Obviously. Obviously. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=898.2s)]
*  Yeah, put these Arabs somewhere else. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=900.2s)]
*  Another Arab country, you know? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=903.2s)]
*  It's just the same. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=905.2s)]
*  ...fewer people would be killed. That's what you mean? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=907.2s)]
*  Yeah, Egypt and Jordan, they should definitely go there. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=910.2s)]
*  By the way, Egypt already had the chance to take on Gaza, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=913.2s)]
*  but eventually they decided not and this is how it became our problem. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=917.2s)]
*  But then again, I don't think that we should solve it anymore [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=921.2s)]
*  because you're not supposed to solve your enemies' problems. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=924.2s)]
*  So it's up to them and the Arabs should be more willing to accept them. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=926.2s)]
*  Okay. But don't you think Israel has a moral responsibility? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=931.2s)]
*  It's a difficult question because I really think that war has... [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=935.2s)]
*  I think that the Western world probably is not aware of what war means, actually. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=940.2s)]
*  And I think that again, taking care of your own enemies is a little bit... [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=947.2s)]
*  It's conflicting, you know? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=952.2s)]
*  It's not our fault that we are stronger than them. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=954.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's also not our fault that we defend ourselves [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=957.2s)]
*  and we have every right to defend ourselves. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=959.2s)]
*  Guatemala! [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=961.2s)]
*  Anyone else have anything to say? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=963.2s)]
*  We are from Palestine, from Hamas, don't hate us Jews, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=965.2s)]
*  we are really nice people and we love life. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=968.2s)]
*  We want peace. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=971.2s)]
*  We just want peace, love and rock and roll. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=972.2s)]
*  Yeah, man! [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=975.2s)]
*  Wait, and you're willing to have peace with Palestinians? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=976.2s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=978.2s)]
*  Anytime. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=979.2s)]
*  With anybody, anyone. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=982.2s)]
*  If they want peace, we want it. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=984.2s)]
*  Do you know how many civilians have been killed in Gaza? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=986.2s)]
*  You know? Okay. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=990.2s)]
*  One moment. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=992.2s)]
*  No, I don't know exactly. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=994.2s)]
*  But I don't want to ask that kind of question. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=996.2s)]
*  No? Okay. Can I ask why? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1000.2s)]
*  No, don't take the pictures. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1003.2s)]
*  Wait, I don't want to... [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1005.2s)]
*  Okay, so what did you want to say? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1007.2s)]
*  What I wanted to say is [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1009.2s)]
*  that it could be that people... [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1011.2s)]
*  how many Palestinians have been killed [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1013.2s)]
*  or things like that [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1015.2s)]
*  but not all people ask [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1017.2s)]
*  how many Israelis have been killed [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1019.2s)]
*  or it's not just a matter of killing [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1022.2s)]
*  there are almost no Israelis who haven't been killed. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1025.2s)]
*  This war, not only this war [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1029.2s)]
*  but actually during all these years [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1031.2s)]
*  and the losses are psychological [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1035.2s)]
*  the losses are not only of Israelis specifically [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1039.2s)]
*  but also all over the world. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1043.2s)]
*  Simply, also from anti-Semitism [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1044.2s)]
*  About Jews all over the world. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1046.2s)]
*  About not killing them [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1048.2s)]
*  and they also have a lot of disinformation [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1050.2s)]
*  about everything that's happening to Palestinians. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1052.2s)]
*  What happens, what they do [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1054.2s)]
*  nobody cares about it outside. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1056.2s)]
*  She was like, I don't want to talk [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1065.2s)]
*  and then was like, never mind [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1067.2s)]
*  let me spit some shit [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1069.2s)]
*  let me spit some truth at you right now, real quick. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1070.2s)]
*  Hamas will remain [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1095.2s)]
*  because they care about how many people [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1097.2s)]
*  and how many children are killed [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1099.2s)]
*  because it's because of them [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1101.2s)]
*  and they didn't hide from the ground [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1103.2s)]
*  So much of Hasbra and so much of the [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1125.2s)]
*  defense of Israel's actions [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1129.2s)]
*  that revolve around [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1132.2s)]
*  dehumanizing Palestinians [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1136.2s)]
*  is oftentimes attributing to Palestinians [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1138.2s)]
*  the crimes of Israel. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1141.2s)]
*  It always sounds insane when you hear [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1143.2s)]
*  someone who defends [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1146.2s)]
*  it always sounds so insane [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1148.2s)]
*  if you're knowledgeable of the situation [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1150.2s)]
*  where every accusation [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1152.2s)]
*  is a confession of Israel's crimes [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1154.2s)]
*  which is ironic because then [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1157.2s)]
*  it turns around and basically justifies [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1159.2s)]
*  Hamas [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1161.2s)]
*  because if you're justifying [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1163.2s)]
*  violent action, unlimited violence [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1165.2s)]
*  against an organization [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1167.2s)]
*  a unit or a military force [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1169.2s)]
*  a militant force that has done these atrocities [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1171.2s)]
*  then you're literally justifying [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1174.2s)]
*  October 7. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1176.2s)]
*  You're justifying more than October 7 [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1177.2s)]
*  which is what Israel is doing [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1179.2s)]
*  to Gaza already. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1181.2s)]
*  It comes from there [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1211.2s)]
*  It starts from all the actions [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1213.2s)]
*  of terrorism [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1215.2s)]
*  of terror [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1219.2s)]
*  and it comes from there [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1221.2s)]
*  so it is impossible to divide it in two [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1223.2s)]
*  The whole of Israel is being attacked [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1227.2s)]
*  not only the families of the victims [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1229.2s)]
*  not only the families of the victims [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1232.2s)]
*  and all the victims [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1234.2s)]
*  It is very important to know that [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1236.2s)]
*  the Israeli army doesn't kill Palestinians [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1239.2s)]
*  only because they want to [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1242.2s)]
*  and that it is for murder [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1244.2s)]
*  they don't go there for murder [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1247.2s)]
*  they know from the head [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1249.2s)]
*  they also throw to them [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1251.2s)]
*  from the planes that are flying [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1253.2s)]
*  that they are going to attack [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1255.2s)]
*  that they know it is a weapon [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1257.2s)]
*  and which army can fight us [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1259.2s)]
*  we will fight [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1262.2s)]
*  the citizens who are in the heart of the... [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1263.2s)]
*  the death of children [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1269.2s)]
*  you know [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1271.2s)]
*  Oh man, it's such a tough job [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1272.2s)]
*  that the Israeli occupying force has [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1274.2s)]
*  you know [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1276.2s)]
*  they have to live with themselves [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1277.2s)]
*  after killing all of those children [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1279.2s)]
*  Can we just reframe the conversation [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1281.2s)]
*  to the real victims here? [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1283.2s)]
*  Me [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1285.2s)]
*  my feelings [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1286.2s)]
*  the feelings of people who have done [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1287.2s)]
*  untold atrocities [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1289.2s)]
*  countless atrocities [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1291.2s)]
*  The place where terrorists and weapons are found [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1292.2s)]
*  is in a different way [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1295.2s)]
*  so people are also harmed [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1296.2s)]
*  Our army is the most brutal in the world [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1298.2s)]
*  no one does that [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1301.2s)]
*  and also, which army in the world [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1302.2s)]
*  please tell me [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1304.2s)]
*  give humanitarian aid during the war [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1306.2s)]
*  to a terrorist who comes to kill [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1309.2s)]
*  and to kill and to carry [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1311.2s)]
*  no army in the world [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1312.2s)]
*  the army is humanitarian [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1314.2s)]
*  again, they know it [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1315.2s)]
*  they don't come to kill [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1317.2s)]
*  they just want to defend the state of Israel [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1318.2s)]
*  and their citizens [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1321.2s)]
*  Do you know how many civilians have been killed in Gaza? [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1323.2s)]
*  I don't know the exact amount [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1327.2s)]
*  but I think it's around [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1329.2s)]
*  20 to 25,000 [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1331.2s)]
*  I think something like that [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1333.2s)]
*  According to Bibi and according to the UN [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1334.2s)]
*  it's around 16,000 [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1336.2s)]
*  that was the latest thing [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1337.2s)]
*  Do you understand why internationally [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1338.2s)]
*  the people are very disturbed by this? [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1340.2s)]
*  Yeah, I do [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1344.2s)]
*  because they don't really understand why it's happening [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1345.2s)]
*  they just see it [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1348.2s)]
*  they scroll on Twitter or whatever it is [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1350.2s)]
*  they just see it [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1353.2s)]
*  they see the facts [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1354.2s)]
*  they don't understand why it's happening [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1355.2s)]
*  they don't really get the bigger picture of the story [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1358.2s)]
*  So what is that? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1362.2s)]
*  The bigger picture of the story is [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1363.2s)]
*  everything is happening because of a group [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1365.2s)]
*  a little violent called Hamas [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1368.2s)]
*  basically everything is happening because of that [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1371.2s)]
*  they started everything [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1374.2s)]
*  they've always wanted war [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1375.2s)]
*  Israelis never want war [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1377.2s)]
*  we don't want it [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1379.2s)]
*  Never [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1380.2s)]
*  Never [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1381.2s)]
*  It just happens to be that way [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1382.2s)]
*  We even barely wanted to start this war [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1385.2s)]
*  after what happened [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1388.2s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1389.2s)]
*  That's basically [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1392.2s)]
*  Does it bother you that so many civilians are getting killed? [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1394.2s)]
*  Listen [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1396.2s)]
*  My brother has been inside the Gaza Strip [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1397.2s)]
*  for around 4.5 months [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1401.2s)]
*  So I know a little bit more than usual people [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1403.2s)]
*  even around Israel [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1407.2s)]
*  But listen [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1409.2s)]
*  Most of the kids there that are getting killed [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1410.2s)]
*  I never support little children dying [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1413.2s)]
*  You know? [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1417.2s)]
*  But if you look at the bigger picture [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1418.2s)]
*  which is shit [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1421.2s)]
*  I don't want to look at it like that [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1422.2s)]
*  Sorry about my [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1423.2s)]
*  You know [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1424.2s)]
*  You never want children to die [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1425.2s)]
*  But some children have bad vibes [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1428.2s)]
*  You know? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1430.2s)]
*  They just happen to be Palestinian [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1431.2s)]
*  My French [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1432.2s)]
*  Most of them will grow up not to hate Israel [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1433.2s)]
*  I don't really care if you hate Israel [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1436.2s)]
*  because most of the world hates Israel [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1438.2s)]
*  But most of them will grow up [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1440.2s)]
*  not only supporting Hamas [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1442.2s)]
*  which is a crime by itself [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1444.2s)]
*  but joining them [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1446.2s)]
*  which is the worst of the worst [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1447.2s)]
*  Listen [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1450.2s)]
*  What happened a couple of years ago [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1451.2s)]
*  with Gilad Shalit [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1453.2s)]
*  We took one soldier that was held captive [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1454.2s)]
*  for around a thousand prisoners [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1458.2s)]
*  and most of those prisoners [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1460.2s)]
*  are the cause of what happened on the 10th of October [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1462.2s)]
*  So we don't know what will happen [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1465.2s)]
*  in years to come [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1468.2s)]
*  if we'll keep doing it, right? [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1471.2s)]
*  But at the end of the day [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1473.2s)]
*  I think that a kid running around shouldn't die [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1474.2s)]
*  Right? [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1479.2s)]
*  Shooting what? [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1480.2s)]
*  Shouldn't die [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1481.2s)]
*  Oh, shouldn't die [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1482.2s)]
*  He shouldn't die [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1483.2s)]
*  That being said [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1484.2s)]
*  I don't know what he'll grow up to [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1485.2s)]
*  Most of them, like around 75-ish percent [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1487.2s)]
*  despise Israel [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1492.2s)]
*  with everything that they hate about the world [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1493.2s)]
*  They hate everything about Israel [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1496.2s)]
*  They don't want anything to do with us [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1497.2s)]
*  They want us all dead, gone [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1499.2s)]
*  and fucking, you know [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1501.2s)]
*  They want my head on a spike [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1502.2s)]
*  and I have never done anything bad ever [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1503.2s)]
*  to any person [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1506.2s)]
*  Even though I did serve in the IDF [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1507.2s)]
*  for three years [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1509.2s)]
*  I did do it [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1510.2s)]
*  But [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1511.2s)]
*  Did you serve in the West Bank or Gaza? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1512.2s)]
*  No, I didn't [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1514.2s)]
*  I didn't [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1515.2s)]
*  I served at the [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1516.2s)]
*  I don't know if I want to say [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1518.2s)]
*  You don't have to say [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1520.2s)]
*  It's ok [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1521.2s)]
*  I served at the Iron Dome [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1522.2s)]
*  and the Iron Dome is only about defense [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1524.2s)]
*  It's not about attack [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1527.2s)]
*  which is why I wanted to serve there [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1529.2s)]
*  You know [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1531.2s)]
*  Even though it was kind of mentally tough [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1532.2s)]
*  But it's all about defense [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1535.2s)]
*  It's all about defending your own family [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1536.2s)]
*  You know [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1539.2s)]
*  There's rockets flying above your family [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1540.2s)]
*  All you want is to stop it [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1542.2s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1543.2s)]
*  Yeah [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1544.2s)]
*  So [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1545.2s)]
*  If you look at it like that [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1546.2s)]
*  that's what I want [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1547.2s)]
*  You were asked very quickly [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1548.2s)]
*  All these civilian deaths are going to create [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1549.2s)]
*  more people who hate Israel [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1552.2s)]
*  who want more to kill [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1553.2s)]
*  Aren't you thinking about that? [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1555.2s)]
*  What's your response? [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1556.2s)]
*  Listen, I think that [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1557.2s)]
*  as soon as more Hamas terrorists die [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1559.2s)]
*  they will bring much less war [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1561.2s)]
*  Even if the exchange is [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1563.2s)]
*  one or two Hamas terrorists [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1566.2s)]
*  for at least four civilians [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1568.2s)]
*  I don't want that to happen [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1569.2s)]
*  I don't want civilians to die [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1570.2s)]
*  Nobody does [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1571.2s)]
*  That's what happens in war [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1572.2s)]
*  There is no war without civilians dying [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1574.2s)]
*  And the quickest way to end the war [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1577.2s)]
*  is to just terminate as many terrorists as we can [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1579.2s)]
*  It doesn't matter [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1583.2s)]
*  So Hamas needs to just get wiped off the map [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1584.2s)]
*  It doesn't matter how it is [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1588.2s)]
*  They are literally just [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1590.2s)]
*  devils walking around us [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1592.2s)]
*  They're not even human beings in my opinion [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1595.2s)]
*  All they see in their head [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1597.2s)]
*  is just eliminating every single human being [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1599.2s)]
*  that doesn't support [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1602.2s)]
*  you know, Islam [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1603.2s)]
*  That's not Islamic [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1604.2s)]
*  That's not Muslim [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1606.2s)]
*  You know, there's different perspectives to that [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1607.2s)]
*  Not everyone in the world is going to be Muslim [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1610.2s)]
*  no matter how you try [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1612.2s)]
*  So, that's just an act of terrorism [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1614.2s)]
*  And that's it [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1617.2s)]
*  Is somebody coming in? [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1619.2s)]
*  Are we going to get killed? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1620.2s)]
*  No we're not [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1621.2s)]
*  Okay, hi everybody [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1622.2s)]
*  I'm glad you got to this point in the video [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1623.2s)]
*  which means you got to the end [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1625.2s)]
*  I really need your help [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1626.2s)]
*  Of course the final point [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1628.2s)]
*  of most of these conversations arrive at [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1631.2s)]
*  Yeah, actually it's good that we're doing all this [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1634.2s)]
*  You have to feel that way [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1637.2s)]
*  Otherwise you would go crazy [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1639.2s)]
*  You would try to overthrow your government [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1641.2s)]
*  And all of these [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1643.2s)]
*  All of this violence [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1645.2s)]
*  All of these like [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1646.2s)]
*  All of these violent desires [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1647.2s)]
*  make it so [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1649.2s)]
*  that Israeli society can be dominated [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1651.2s)]
*  by some of the worst right-wing forces [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1654.2s)]
*  without the population ever [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1658.2s)]
*  understanding what's happening to them [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1660.2s)]
*  Now, it might not be [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1662.2s)]
*  It's nowhere near as consequential as just like [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1664.2s)]
*  Wholesale destruction and death [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1667.2s)]
*  But this is something that already [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1670.2s)]
*  This is something that already happened in like 2018 [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5qzzi1VkQA&t=1672.2s)]
