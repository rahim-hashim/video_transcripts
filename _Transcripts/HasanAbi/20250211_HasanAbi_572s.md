# Trump’s White House Actions Face Court Challenges | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA)
*  I mean, that's literally what their argument is. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=0.0s)]
*  Their argument is that the federal agencies have no power [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=2.52s)]
*  and that the executive authority actually can undermine [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=7.96s)]
*  the funding of federal agencies. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=12.6s)]
*  They can't redirect funds as openly and as actively, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=16.0s)]
*  but they can certainly decide, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=20.14s)]
*  even if Congress has appointed or tasked agencies [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=25.18s)]
*  to do certain things, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=31.62s)]
*  even if Congress has actually allocated resources. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=33.02s)]
*  Court challenges the President Trump [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=43.14s)]
*  and Elon Musk's effort to reshape the federal government. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=45.06s)]
*  The administration is pushing back after a federal judge [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=48.94s)]
*  found that it was violating a court order. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=51.42s)]
*  Martian political correspondent, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=53.82s)]
*  Rachel Scott is tracking it all for us. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=55.980000000000004s)]
*  Good morning, Rachel. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=58.1s)]
*  Michael, good morning to you. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=59.64s)]
*  And this is really turning into a showdown [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=60.78s)]
*  between the Trump administration and also the courts. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=62.7s)]
*  Nearly every single effort put forward [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=65.44s)]
*  by President Trump and Elon Musk [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=67.3s)]
*  to shrink the size of the federal government [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=68.98s)]
*  is facing legal challenges. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=70.9s)]
*  Just hours after a federal judge [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=73.53999999999999s)]
*  accuses administration of violating a court order, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=75.53999999999999s)]
*  President Trump blasting the courts [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=78.64s)]
*  that have temporarily halted his agenda. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=80.36s)]
*  But judges should be ruling. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=82.78s)]
*  They shouldn't be dictating what you're supposed to be doing. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=85.38s)]
*  For the first time in his second term, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=88.3s)]
*  a federal judge finding his administration [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=90.1s)]
*  violated an order to fully lift its freeze [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=92.3s)]
*  on federal funding, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=94.74000000000001s)]
*  calling the pause likely unconstitutional [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=96.06s)]
*  and adding that it continues to cause irreparable harm [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  to a vast portion of this country. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=101.7s)]
*  But the Trump administration pressing forward [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=103.9s)]
*  with their plans to shrink the size of the federal government. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=106.22s)]
*  Let us work, let us work. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=108.98s)]
*  Frustrated workers protesting [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=111.94s)]
*  outside the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=113.53999999999999s)]
*  in Washington after Elon Musk and his team [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=115.74s)]
*  essentially shut the agency down. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=118.78s)]
*  Employees receiving an email [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=121.12s)]
*  that they should not come into the office [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=122.62s)]
*  instructing them, please do not perform work tasks. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=124.62s)]
*  You show up to work on Monday morning, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=127.58s)]
*  excited to get started on the week. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=129.3s)]
*  I had an agenda of things that I was ready to do [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=130.86s)]
*  to fight for American consumers [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=133.66s)]
*  and to be told that I'm not supposed to do that [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=136.02s)]
*  is heartbreaking. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=138.82s)]
*  The Bureau was created after the 2008 financial crisis [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=139.98s)]
*  to protect American families from unfair [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=143.14s)]
*  and deceptive practices on everything from work. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=145.42s)]
*  It's like some of the few good things [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=148.17999999999998s)]
*  that the government does, dude. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=149.94s)]
*  I hate this. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=152.17999999999998s)]
*  It's one of the few good things, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=153.26s)]
*  like objective good things [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=157.01999999999998s)]
*  that the federal government is tasked with. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=158.79999999999998s)]
*  Orgages to credit cards. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=161.29999999999998s)]
*  The president eager to move ahead [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=163.01999999999998s)]
*  with his mass buyout offer [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=164.62s)]
*  to some 2 million federal workers [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=166.01999999999998s)]
*  to either resign now with pay until September [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=168.26s)]
*  or run the risk of being fired. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=170.98s)]
*  A federal judge putting it on hold yet again, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=172.98s)]
*  prompting confusion and uncertainty for many. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=175.82s)]
*  April Goggins works for the Department [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=178.78s)]
*  of Health and Human Services. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=180.42s)]
*  No, I'm not resigned. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=181.85999999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna hold the line, not resigning. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=182.7s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=184.22s)]
*  First of all, you're not gonna bully me out of a job. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=185.62s)]
*  The administration says they have heard [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=188.73999999999998s)]
*  from at least 65,000 workers who are willing to resign. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=190.42s)]
*  I got elected on making government better, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=194.42s)]
*  more efficient, and smaller. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=198.29999999999998s)]
*  And that's what we're doing. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=200.98s)]
*  And I think it was a very generous buyout, actually. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=202.14s)]
*  So after Elon Musk and Vice President J.D. Vance [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=206.18s)]
*  openly questioned the authority of the courts, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=208.78s)]
*  several Republicans over on Capitol Hill, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=211.1s)]
*  including Senate Majority Leader John Thune, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=212.94s)]
*  drawing a very clear contrast, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=215.01999999999998s)]
*  he says the courts have an important role to play [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=216.9s)]
*  in moderating power, Michael. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=219.26s)]
*  Yeah, we'd all have to agree with that, Rachel. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=221.1s)]
*  Rachel Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=222.9s)]
*  they're feuding again. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=225.74s)]
*  Yeah, they're at it again. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=227.42000000000002s)]
*  This time after Elon Musk put in a $97.4 billion offer [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=228.74s)]
*  to buy OpenAI, a leading artificial intelligence company. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=233.74s)]
*  Well, Sam Altman is the CEO of that company. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=236.9s)]
*  He responded very bluntly by saying, no, thank you. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=239.18s)]
*  The president did launch an initiative [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=241.9s)]
*  with several companies, including OpenAI. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=243.98000000000002s)]
*  So this would raise a conflict of interest for Musk, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=246.5s)]
*  who is the world's richest man, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=249.06s)]
*  the billionaire who already owns SpaceX, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=250.94s)]
*  the social media company X, as well as Tesla, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=253.58s)]
*  and of course he's now working in the administration, guys. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=255.70000000000002s)]
*  Okay, Rachel, thanks very much. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=258.06s)]
*  It's been our chief legal analyst, Dan Abens. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=259.22s)]
*  We've got these showdowns brewing between the president [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=260.82s)]
*  and the courts now on several fronts. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=263.1s)]
*  Right, let's keep in mind there's a difference [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=264.90000000000003s)]
*  between not complying at this particular moment and defying. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=267.1s)]
*  What's the difference? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=271.46000000000004s)]
*  Not complying happens in cases, right? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=272.54s)]
*  One party goes to court and says, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=274.90000000000003s)]
*  hey, they're not complying with your order, judge. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=276.3s)]
*  Defying means we're ignoring it. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=279.46000000000004s)]
*  We're not gonna do it. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=282.9s)]
*  And so far we have not seen overt defiance. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=284.9s)]
*  We've seen the parties coming in and saying, wait a sec, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=288.94s)]
*  they have not complied with your order, judge. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=293.38s)]
*  The Department of Justice still treating it seriously, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=295.82s)]
*  still appealing the rulings, doing all the things [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=298.26s)]
*  that one would typically do in a legal proceeding. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=301.08s)]
*  And you mentioned defiance. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=304.1s)]
*  A social media post, Vice President JD Vance, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=305.38s)]
*  he wrote, quote, judges aren't allowed to control [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=308.22s)]
*  the executives of a legitimate power. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=310.3s)]
*  Does that sound defiant to you? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=313.14s)]
*  That's a lot scarier, right? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=314.82s)]
*  What JD Vance is saying is much scarier [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=316.74s)]
*  than what's actually happening in court. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=319.5s)]
*  Because JD Vance is suggesting in that and in other posts [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=321.42s)]
*  that you know what, if the executive branch doesn't agree [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=324.96000000000004s)]
*  with a ruling that the courts make, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=328.14s)]
*  the executive branch in the end can have the final say. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=330.54s)]
*  Think about what that would mean. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=333.46000000000004s)]
*  If that's the case, that means the courts don't have a role. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=334.90000000000003s)]
*  That if the executive branch... [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=337.8s)]
*  I mean, that's literally what their argument is. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=339.42s)]
*  Their argument is that the federal agencies have no power [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=341.5s)]
*  and that the executive authority actually can undermine [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=346.94s)]
*  the funding of federal agencies. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=351.54s)]
*  They can't redirect funds as openly and as actively, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=354.96s)]
*  but they can certainly decide, even if Congress, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=359.1s)]
*  even if Congress has appointed or tasked agencies [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=364.14000000000004s)]
*  to do certain things, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=370.58000000000004s)]
*  even if Congress has actually allocated resources, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=371.96000000000004s)]
*  one of the main arguments that they're trying to make [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=376.86s)]
*  is that regardless of the congressional allocation of funds, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=379.14000000000004s)]
*  that the executive authority still can very much decide [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=386.5s)]
*  not to spend funds in a certain way. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=392.38s)]
*  Like they can stop. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=394.7s)]
*  It is a new level of federal overreach. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=395.9s)]
*  Their argument ultimately is that the executive branch [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=400.18s)]
*  should be even congressional funding, which is ridiculous. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=404.94s)]
*  But it also is another... [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=411.1s)]
*  It's the logical conclusion [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=414.26s)]
*  of the unitary executive theory. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=415.62s)]
*  Okay? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=419.74s)]
*  This is something that has been ongoing [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=420.98s)]
*  and it's at the heart of the governance agenda [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=422.78000000000003s)]
*  of the Republican party since the 90s openly. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=427.78000000000003s)]
*  They wanted to do unitary power [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=430.90000000000003s)]
*  and offer more power to the executive branch. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=433.34000000000003s)]
*  And they're precisely moving in that direction. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=436.98s)]
*  The president decides he wants to do something [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=441.58000000000004s)]
*  and the courts say you're not allowed to do it. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=444.74s)]
*  Well, the president's just gonna do what he wants. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=447.74s)]
*  That's frightening. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=450.74s)]
*  I mean, here it is. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=451.94s)]
*  Look, this is NBC News. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=452.78000000000003s)]
*  A senior FEMA official instructed subordinates [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=454.06s)]
*  to freeze funding for a wide array of grant programs Monday, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=455.90000000000003s)]
*  just hours after a federal judge ordered [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=458.38s)]
*  the Trump administration for the second time [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=460.02s)]
*  to stop such pauses. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=461.54s)]
*  It's turning into a showdown. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=464.26s)]
*  Before people say, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=466.02s)]
*  Hassan, what about the leftist monarch position [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=466.82s)]
*  or whatever the f**k? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=468.86s)]
*  I'm telling you, I don't care. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=469.74s)]
*  Okay? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=472.52s)]
*  I'm openly telling you, there is no hypocrisy baiting. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=473.66s)]
*  There's no hypocrisy baiting for the Republicans. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=476.78s)]
*  Okay? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=479.38s)]
*  They do not care. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=480.21999999999997s)]
*  And we shouldn't either. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=481.94s)]
*  We should use the existing institutions to our advantage [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=483.41999999999996s)]
*  in the interim to obstruct the Trump agenda [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=488.44s)]
*  every step of the way. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=491.7s)]
*  And if we ever get control over the reins of power [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=493.09999999999997s)]
*  once again, we should also not listen [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=497.09999999999997s)]
*  to any sort of hurdles, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=500.14s)]
*  any sort of obstruction, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=502.06s)]
*  obstructionist measures implemented [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=505.74s)]
*  by the Republican parties broadly. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=508.46s)]
*  Okay? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=510.38s)]
*  They don't care about hypocrisy. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=511.21999999999997s)]
*  It's very obvious. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=512.66s)]
*  That's it. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=514.06s)]
*  That's why it's so important what Rachel just pointed out [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=514.9s)]
*  about Republican senators coming forward [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=517.18s)]
*  and saying that's not the case. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=519.22s)]
*  So what would happen if a president did defy, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=520.62s)]
*  defy a court order? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=523.54s)]
*  It gets tricky. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=524.9399999999999s)]
*  It's supposed to be handled in the political arena. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=526.1s)]
*  Look, if it's a particular person, if it's Elon Musk, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=528.38s)]
*  a court could issue sanctions, right? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=530.82s)]
*  They could say for every day you don't do this, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=532.58s)]
*  this is how much you're gonna have to pay, et cetera. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=535.0200000000001s)]
*  If it's the president of the United States, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=537.3000000000001s)]
*  in the end, it kind of has to be dealt with [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=539.22s)]
*  in the political arena, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=540.98s)]
*  which is why it's so important to watch those Republicans. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=541.82s)]
*  Except when it goes to the Supreme Court. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=543.7800000000001s)]
*  Eventually they're gonna decide on one of these cases [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=545.62s)]
*  and then we're gonna have the real confrontation. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=547.7800000000001s)]
*  Correct. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=549.46s)]
*  Meaning you still have the same question in the end, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=550.3000000000001s)]
*  which is are they gonna listen to the Supreme Court? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=552.0600000000001s)]
*  Which JD Vance seems to be suggesting maybe we don't. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=554.22s)]
*  All right. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=557.7800000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=558.62s)]
*  Our thanks to you as always. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=559.82s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=560.9000000000001s)]
*  Oh man, I look terrible today. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=562.74s)]
*  No, no, come on, come on, come on. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=564.46s)]
*  We're going quick. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=566.14s)]
*  Oh god. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSot26cOgA&t=566.98s)]
