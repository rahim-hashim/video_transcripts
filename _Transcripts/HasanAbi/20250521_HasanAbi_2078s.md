# Does Israel Have A Right To Exist? | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY)
*  I'm like, yeah, OK, yeah. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=0.0s)]
*  If Israel is going to only maintain [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1.68s)]
*  itself as it says, it seems like it [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=3.68s)]
*  will, then yeah, it [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=5.46s)]
*  has no right to exist. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  It is literally illegal for Israel [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=8.88s)]
*  to exist in the current ways that it [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=10.76s)]
*  does. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=12.36s)]
*  I don't think that's a controversial [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=13.6s)]
*  thing to say. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=15.16s)]
*  It's really for death. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=21.56s)]
*  This was insane. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  This was an insane story. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=24.96s)]
*  We're going to talk about kneecap as [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=25.98s)]
*  well. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=27.14s)]
*  Piers Morgan jump ship on Israel. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=28.62s)]
*  Oh, look at that. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=30.7s)]
*  I have resigned. I resisted going as [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=32.94s)]
*  far as you have done in your [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=34.660000000000004s)]
*  criticism of the Israeli government. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=35.58s)]
*  I resist no more. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=36.620000000000005s)]
*  We're in agreement. Piers Morgan to [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=37.42s)]
*  me on a show today. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=38.74s)]
*  I decided retired Israeli General [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=39.94s)]
*  Yair Golan saying Israel is now [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=41.980000000000004s)]
*  killing babies as a hobby. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=43.34s)]
*  This is also part of the reason why [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=45.22s)]
*  I don't even shit on like [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=46.540000000000006s)]
*  a lot of people will yell at me for [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=48.7s)]
*  his commentary, but everybody plays [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=50.38s)]
*  a different role in this because [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=52.18s)]
*  if the old Vaughn is getting Trump [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=54.7s)]
*  hogs to recognize Israel [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=56.260000000000005s)]
*  doing a genocide, great. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=58.3s)]
*  If Mehdi is getting the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=60.14s)]
*  liberal Zionist coalition [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=62.18s)]
*  or the or the liberals [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=64.44s)]
*  that normally are turning a blind eye [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=67.02s)]
*  to Israel doing it to get on board [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=68.7s)]
*  with this, then great. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=70.74s)]
*  OK, everybody serves a different [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=71.86s)]
*  purpose in this. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=73.88s)]
*  It's not about. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=74.94s)]
*  It's not just about like [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=76.82s)]
*  like the questionable stuff that [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=78.98s)]
*  people do. That's why I don't spend a [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=80.7s)]
*  lot of time on like Owen Jones or [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=81.9s)]
*  Mehdi. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=83.7s)]
*  Like, I don't care, you know, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=84.98s)]
*  not everyone is going to be [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=87.02000000000001s)]
*  perfect vessels here. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=88.82000000000001s)]
*  They're not going to be perfect [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=90.22s)]
*  allies. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=91.14s)]
*  And I personally don't care. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=92.10000000000001s)]
*  I just as long as they are. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=93.66000000000001s)]
*  Like even if they're standing, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=96.46000000000001s)]
*  if even if they're not standing in [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=98.38000000000001s)]
*  the way, that's good enough for me. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=100.34s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=101.9s)]
*  Therein lies what I expect [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=103.98s)]
*  from Bernie versus why I don't [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=106.10000000000001s)]
*  constantly rail against Bernie. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=107.54s)]
*  Do you see what I mean? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=109.22s)]
*  Because Bernie Sanders is a liberal [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=110.86000000000001s)]
*  Zionist. Bernie Sanders is like a [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=112.62s)]
*  labor Zionist. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=114.10000000000001s)]
*  He's it's pure fantasy [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=115.06s)]
*  the way he approaches the subject [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=117.25999999999999s)]
*  matter of Israel, where he's like, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=118.89999999999999s)]
*  oh, Israel has a right to defend [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=120.02s)]
*  itself after 19 months. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=121.02s)]
*  That's disgusting. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=122.22s)]
*  What an insane thing to say. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=123.14s)]
*  Having said that, he at [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=124.89999999999999s)]
*  least has the decency [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=126.78s)]
*  to step aside when [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=128.82s)]
*  there are people who have a more [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=130.74s)]
*  radical position on this issue. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=132.1s)]
*  And he does not stand in their way [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=134.22s)]
*  and tell them to shut the up or say [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=136.46s)]
*  that their goddamn Hamas agents or [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=138.48s)]
*  whatever the on a daily basis. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=140.2s)]
*  Do you see what I mean? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=142.62s)]
*  Was met the off about [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=144.54s)]
*  Matias on is awesome. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=146.22s)]
*  Zateo has done incredible work, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=147.98000000000002s)]
*  but there are definitely still [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=150.58s)]
*  people who yell at him [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=151.94s)]
*  because he was too much on [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=153.70000000000002s)]
*  the condemn Hamas [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=155.62s)]
*  train post October 7. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=157.74s)]
*  That's it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=160.5s)]
*  It's mostly just like old [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=161.22s)]
*  grievances that people have with [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=163.22s)]
*  people like Matty or even [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=164.58s)]
*  a or even like [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=166.5s)]
*  an inability to comprehend like [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=168.58s)]
*  what their role [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=170.3s)]
*  is here, what their responsibility [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=172.34s)]
*  is here. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=174.06s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=174.82s)]
*  I probably never once said I [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=175.9s)]
*  condemn Hamas that she was stupid. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=177.26s)]
*  Yeah, you're also not a professional [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=178.54s)]
*  media person who [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=180.26s)]
*  is is making this complicated [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=182.54s)]
*  math equation of like, do I still [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=184.98000000000002s)]
*  get to have a prominent platform [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=187.02s)]
*  where I can say the truth about [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=188.9s)]
*  Israel? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=190.18s)]
*  Because that's the way to unlock [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=191.26s)]
*  that. OK, otherwise, the entire [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=192.58s)]
*  conversation turns into [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=194.74s)]
*  not condoming hummus hard enough. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=196.98000000000002s)]
*  That's it. That's the difference. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=199.54s)]
*  A lot of people also on Twitter [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=200.94s)]
*  will be like, wow, why are people [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=202.82s)]
*  taking these like liberal [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=204.3s)]
*  ass attitudes? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=206.02s)]
*  It's like you have to pay the piper. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=206.78s)]
*  And there's obviously a complex [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=209.38s)]
*  math equation there [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=211.54s)]
*  and and there are understandable [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=213.3s)]
*  red lines that people said myself. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=215.1s)]
*  You know what my red line is, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=217.22s)]
*  but it is what it is. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=219.1s)]
*  Speaking of which, by the way, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=220.34s)]
*  here is something that took place [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=223.14s)]
*  with Zoran as well. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=225.14s)]
*  A lot of people were yelling at him [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=226.1s)]
*  too. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=227.3s)]
*  Uh, over his [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=228.82000000000002s)]
*  Israel has a right to exist line, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=231.02s)]
*  which I totally understand why he [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=233.46s)]
*  said that. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=235.58s)]
*  Here was my take on it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=237.14000000000001s)]
*  But here, New York City [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=238.18s)]
*  mayoral candidate Zoran Mamdani [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=240.3s)]
*  this morning following the story [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=241.70000000000002s)]
*  that he declined to sign on to the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=242.70000000000002s)]
*  assembly resolutions recognize [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=243.70000000000002s)]
*  Israel's independence and [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=244.9s)]
*  condemning the Holocaust. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=246.62s)]
*  I do support Israel's right to [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=247.54000000000002s)]
*  exist as a state, he says. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=248.82000000000002s)]
*  Right to exist. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=250.18s)]
*  Yes, I do support its right to [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=252.54000000000002s)]
*  exist as a state. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=253.86s)]
*  Do you? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=254.86s)]
*  And like the thing [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=256.02s)]
*  is, this is a gotcha. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=257.9s)]

*  right to exist? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=268.94s)]

*  All right. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=273.85999999999996s)]
*  It's incredibly stupid to ask this [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=275.26s)]
*  question. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=276.9s)]
*  No state has [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=277.7s)]
*  a right to exist. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=279.53999999999996s)]
*  There is no like fundamental [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=280.85999999999996s)]

*  all. People have a [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=285.85999999999996s)]
*  right to exist within [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=287.66s)]

*  that you could consider a state. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=291.62s)]

*  OK, the reason why I say this is [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=295.78000000000003s)]
*  because here's my answer. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=297.46000000000004s)]
*  No state has a right to exist. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=298.26000000000005s)]
*  People have a right to exist. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=299.34000000000003s)]
*  Israel already exists as a [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=300.74s)]
*  state. Palestine, for example, does [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=302.54s)]
*  not currently exist as a state. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=304.42s)]
*  But having said that, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=306.06s)]
*  Nazi Germany had no right to exist. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=308.3s)]
*  Neither did Rhodesia. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=310.26000000000005s)]
*  Israel is an apartheid state doing [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=311.38s)]
*  its right, has no right to exist [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=312.90000000000003s)]
*  in its current formation. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=314.90000000000003s)]
*  That's it. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=316.5s)]
*  OK, that's it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=317.78000000000003s)]
*  And I will tell anyone [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=319.34000000000003s)]
*  that turns around and says like. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=321.42s)]
*  Anyone that turns around and says [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=324.14000000000004s)]
*  like, oh, you mean, so you want [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=325.38000000000005s)]
*  Israel to not exist? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=326.62s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, OK, yeah. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=327.78000000000003s)]
*  If Israel is going to only maintain [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=329.3s)]
*  itself as an apartheid state, it [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=331.3s)]
*  seems like it will. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=332.5s)]
*  Then, yeah, it has no right [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=333.94000000000005s)]
*  to exist. It is literally illegal [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=335.82000000000005s)]
*  for Israel to exist in the current [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=337.86s)]
*  ways that it does. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=339.54s)]
*  I don't think that's a controversial [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=341.22s)]
*  thing to say. Now, obviously, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=342.78000000000003s)]
*  obviously, there's [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=344.66s)]
*  a difference between me saying that [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=346.74s)]
*  as a white Muslim [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=348.38s)]
*  dude in America as a political [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=350.78000000000003s)]
*  commentator on Twitch, not even on [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=352.26s)]
*  mainstream outlets. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=354.06s)]
*  Even if I do have a mainstream [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=356.06s)]
*  audience here versus [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=358.82s)]
*  a brown Muslim dude [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=361.22s)]
*  running for office as mayor of [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=363.5s)]
*  New York, I said, I like Zoran [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=365.5s)]
*  a lot. I don't think that anyone has [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=367.38s)]
*  to play these games anymore, but [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=368.86s)]
*  maybe the boomer electorate of New [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=369.98s)]
*  York City is not equipped to hear [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=371.26s)]
*  that from a Muslim mayoral candidate. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=372.34000000000003s)]
*  That's it. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=374.26s)]
*  Like, I'm still willing to entertain [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=375.65999999999997s)]
*  or give grace to Zoran on this issue, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=377.5s)]
*  especially because Zoran [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=379.65999999999997s)]
*  is not a Zionist, like he [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=382.98s)]
*  is not pro-Israel in any [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=384.94s)]
*  meaningful capacity. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=386.9s)]
*  It's ridiculous to make it seem as [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=388.62s)]
*  though he's now like controlled [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=390.53999999999996s)]
*  opposition or totally held [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=391.86s)]
*  captive or something like that. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=393.7s)]
*  I think it's sort of another from the [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=395.42s)]
*  river to the sea thing. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=396.58s)]
*  For example, Norm saying it's not [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=397.42s)]
*  ideal because it leaves room for [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=398.65999999999997s)]
*  malicious interpretation. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=399.65999999999997s)]
*  Saying Israel doesn't have a right to [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=400.82s)]
*  exist is also not ideal [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=402.09999999999997s)]
*  because it leaves room for malicious [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=404.06s)]
*  interpretation. Not to say we [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=405.22s)]
*  shouldn't kowtow to bad faith actors, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=406.3s)]
*  but it's still an all force error. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=407.86s)]
*  Yeah. Which is why I'm offering [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=409.26s)]
*  clarity to what I mean when I say [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=410.86s)]
*  Israel does not have a right to [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=413.22s)]
*  exist as an apartheid state doing it. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=414.86s)]
*  If Israel was not doing [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=416.78000000000003s)]
*  and if it was not an apartheid [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=419.26s)]
*  occupation, then the equation [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=420.66s)]
*  would be very different. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=422.54s)]
*  First of all, there would be no Hamas, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=423.54s)]
*  for example. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=424.94s)]
*  Like there would be no militancy [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=426.66s)]
*  against it. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=428.22s)]
*  It would be an entirely different [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=429.02s)]
*  enterprise. You might as well call it [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=430.5s)]
*  a different state at that point. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=431.82s)]
*  You might as well call it Palestine at [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=433.06s)]
*  that point. It doesn't matter. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=434.34s)]
*  It's not Israel at that point. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=435.3s)]
*  It's something totally different. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=436.7s)]
*  And that's what it is. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=438.82s)]
*  Do you believe here? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=440.06s)]
*  Yes. This is Francesca Albanese [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=440.82s)]
*  is from, by the way, obviously, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=442.46s)]
*  when I say what I say, and [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=445.06s)]
*  she is 100 percent correct. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=446.94s)]
*  That Israel has a right to exist. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=448.5s)]
*  Israel does exist. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=450.58s)]
*  Israel is a recognized member of [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=452.06s)]
*  the United Nations. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=454.26s)]
*  Besides this, there is not [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=457.42s)]
*  such a thing in international law [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=459.42s)]
*  like a right of a state to exist. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=461.18s)]
*  Does Italy has a right to exist? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=463.54s)]
*  Italy exists. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=465.46000000000004s)]

*  This is not up to us. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=472.26000000000005s)]
*  What is enshrining international [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=473.70000000000005s)]
*  law is the right of a people [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=476.22s)]
*  to exist. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=478.18s)]
*  So the state is there. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=479.54s)]
*  The state of Israel is there, is [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=480.98s)]

*  we should. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=523.0600000000001s)]
*  We should be a little bit better [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=525.22s)]

*  responses, you know, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=528.98s)]
*  I think that I [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=531.34s)]
*  think that if you are a [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=533.5s)]

*  some quippy because this is [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=539.94s)]
*  a fucking cynical question, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=541.86s)]
*  right? This is not a real question. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=543.66s)]
*  Oh, does Israel ever write to [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=545.1s)]
*  is like, what the fuck do you mean? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=546.4200000000001s)]
*  What do you mean? Does Israel ever [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=547.62s)]
*  write to exist? Right. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=549.14s)]
*  You said it on Twitter. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=551.02s)]
*  I said it on stream. It doesn't [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=551.9s)]
*  fucking matter. Ideologies of local [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=552.74s)]
*  interpretations, Bolshevism in the [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=554.0600000000001s)]
*  USSR, Maoism in China, of the [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=555.22s)]
*  socialist ideology. Same way [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=556.9s)]
*  Italian fascism in Italy, Nazism [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=558.02s)]
*  in Germany and so on. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=559.5s)]
*  Zionism is fascism adapted to the [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=560.62s)]
*  Israeli condition. Nothing [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=562.3000000000001s)]
*  controversial about this, as you've [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=563.26s)]
*  said. Exactly. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=564.42s)]
*  So so this is [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=565.74s)]
*  a very cynical [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=567.86s)]
*  way to ask this question. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=570.62s)]
*  It is an all lives matter style [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=571.98s)]
*  question. OK, it [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=573.86s)]
*  is an all lives matter to a black [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=575.82s)]
*  lives matter equation [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=577.14s)]
*  here. OK, just like [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=579.14s)]
*  claiming to the front of the river [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=580.98s)]
*  to the sea, Palestine would be free [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=582.02s)]
*  is like the idea [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=583.46s)]
*  that like we have to criminalize [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=585.58s)]
*  this statement, which is an [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=586.9s)]
*  emancipatory slogan [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=588.5s)]
*  because of what [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=590.62s)]
*  people who defend Israel [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=593.38s)]
*  interpreted as is ridiculous. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=594.62s)]
*  OK, it's the same exact [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=597.74s)]
*  problem with the does Israel have [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=599.7s)]
*  a right to exist question. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=601.1800000000001s)]
*  It is designed in [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=602.74s)]
*  this very cynical way. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=604.66s)]
*  For for people to be tripped [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=607.82s)]
*  up and be afraid, be afraid [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=610.02s)]
*  of answering it in a thoughtful [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=612.38s)]
*  manner. But since it's 19 months [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=614.62s)]
*  into a genocide that has been [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=616.6999999999999s)]
*  broadcasted, a live stream [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=617.9399999999999s)]
*  child Holocaust, I think [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=619.9399999999999s)]
*  it's appropriate for people to [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=621.9399999999999s)]
*  to answer this correctly. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=623.8199999999999s)]
*  Zoran represents the DSA. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=626.5s)]
*  He's saying this is a DSA endorsed [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=627.6999999999999s)]
*  candidate. Does Israel have a right [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=629.06s)]
*  to exist is a central question of [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=630.18s)]
*  Zionism. If you do not deny this [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=631.46s)]
*  question, then you cannot claim [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=632.6999999999999s)]
*  anti-Zionism. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=634.54s)]
*  No, I I I don't [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=636.74s)]
*  chatter, slatty, matty. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=639.5s)]
*  I agree. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=641.22s)]
*  That's why I'm saying there is a [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=642.42s)]
*  there's an appropriate way to [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=643.78s)]
*  answer it. And I think someone [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=644.98s)]
*  at this stage should be [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=647.34s)]
*  able to answer it appropriately. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=649.34s)]
*  That's what I mean, because it is [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=650.98s)]
*  a disingenuous question. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=652.78s)]
*  OK, it's a disingenuous [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=654.42s)]
*  question. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=656.14s)]
*  It's like saying, do you condemn [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=656.98s)]
*  October 7, 19 months in [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=658.46s)]
*  to be like October 7, October 7, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=660.46s)]
*  October 7, October 7. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=661.98s)]
*  The answer to that since October [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=663.54s)]
*  7 was how did October [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=665.66s)]
*  7 happen is the real question that [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=667.58s)]
*  we must ask ourselves. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=668.94s)]
*  And if you think it happened [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=670.3000000000001s)]
*  because of the barbarity of [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=671.6600000000001s)]
*  Muslims, if you think that they're [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=673.34s)]
*  just like especially [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=674.5s)]
*  and exceptionally anti-Semitic [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=676.82s)]
*  and that's why they did October 7, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=678.82s)]
*  then you're wrong. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=680.58s)]
*  That is not the reason. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=681.62s)]
*  The reason is the 74 [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=682.86s)]
*  years of apartheid occupation [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=685.14s)]
*  and ethnic cleansing that took [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=687.34s)]
*  place that led to [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=688.5400000000001s)]
*  the rise of militant resistance [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=690.9000000000001s)]
*  against such matters. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=693.0600000000001s)]
*  This is precisely how October 7 [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=694.22s)]
*  happened. This is precisely why [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=695.98s)]
*  October 7 happened. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=697.06s)]
*  That's it. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=698.26s)]
*  At a occasion magazine, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=699.4599999999999s)]

*  by his mere presence. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=797.46s)]
*  People are already assuming that he [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=799.1s)]
*  is pro Hamas and pro a million [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=800.82s)]
*  October 7th. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=803.82s)]
*  Like, does that mean he has to [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=804.78s)]
*  like massage his narrative? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=806.66s)]
*  No, I think you should be honest [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=808.86s)]
*  about his perspective. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=810.22s)]
*  I think the reason why. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=811.46s)]
*  So was the right answer. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=813.1s)]
*  The right answer is what I said. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=814.06s)]
*  I'm like this is a disingenuous [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=815.5s)]
*  question. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=817.7399999999999s)]
*  This is a totally disingenuous [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=818.6199999999999s)]
*  question. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=820.18s)]
*  And the the the answer to it [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=821.02s)]
*  is no state has a right to exist. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=823.4599999999999s)]
*  People have a right to exist, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=825.8599999999999s)]
*  but no state has a right to do [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=827.26s)]
*  genocide and apartheid. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=828.5799999999999s)]
*  So therefore, no, Israel does not [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=829.8199999999999s)]
*  have a right to exist in the ways [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=831.66s)]
*  that it currently does. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=833.0999999999999s)]
*  It's that simple. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=834.5s)]
*  Like Zoran knows is a genocide. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=835.5799999999999s)]
*  He understands is a genocide. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=837.6999999999999s)]
*  He has spoken out against the [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=839.6999999999999s)]
*  genocide multiple times. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=841.3399999999999s)]
*  It's not like, um. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=843.1s)]
*  It's not like what do you call it? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=845.66s)]
*  This is to me is shooting yourself [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=848.5400000000001s)]
*  in the foot. You were running. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=849.78s)]
*  You're ruining the chance of people [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=850.9s)]
*  getting empowered that can actually [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=852.02s)]
*  help this clip makes him look bad [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=853.1800000000001s)]
*  and hers is chances. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=854.38s)]
*  You either want people that agree [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=855.1800000000001s)]
*  with you in power or not. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=856.14s)]
*  No, I I don't think it's [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=857.9s)]
*  appropriate to be like, yeah, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=859.94s)]
*  that Palestinian person whose fucking [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=861.1s)]
*  family members are being ethnically [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=862.86s)]
*  clashed should be chill about the [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=864.58s)]
*  ethnic cleansing that's taking place. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=866.4200000000001s)]
*  So South Africa didn't have a right [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=869.38s)]
*  to exist before 1994. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=870.78s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=872.34s)]
*  My assumption is there. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=873.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=875.5s)]
*  Yes, apartheid South Africa had no [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=877.02s)]

*  Yes. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=881.5400000000001s)]
*  Did the Confederacy have a right to exist? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=882.38s)]
*  Did the Confederate states of the [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=884.82s)]
*  United States have a right to [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=886.02s)]
*  secession and a right to exist? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=887.34s)]
*  While still upholding the [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=890.46s)]

*  Why the fuck would I ever say? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=896.38s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=898.98s)]
*  America right now doesn't even [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=900.26s)]
*  have a fucking right to exist. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=902.06s)]
*  Like, what are we talking about? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=903.4599999999999s)]
*  What are we fucking talking about? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=905.78s)]
*  Yeah, rights are reserved to people [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=908.26s)]
*  and corporations. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=910.26s)]
*  Yeah, so Nazi Germany didn't have [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=911.3399999999999s)]
*  a right to exist. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=913.0999999999999s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=913.8199999999999s)]
*  I think given the insane amounts [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=914.8199999999999s)]
*  of attacks he's receiving at this point. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=917.66s)]

*  You know, you're conflating [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=925.7399999999999s)]
*  criminality and a right to exist [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=927.2199999999999s)]
*  as a murder have a right to exist. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=928.8199999999999s)]
*  I would say yes. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=930.3399999999999s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=931.3s)]
*  Dude, no, if it's if it's if a states [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=933.2199999999999s)]
*  exist, first of all, people are not states. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=937.0999999999999s)]
*  That's why I say people have a right [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=939.02s)]
*  to exist. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=940.42s)]
*  States do not. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=941.26s)]
*  But if a state's existence relies [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=942.5799999999999s)]
*  on the ethnic cleansing of the [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=944.9s)]
*  indigenous population, then yeah, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=946.3399999999999s)]
*  it's like saying does a murderer [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=948.66s)]
*  have a right to exist? [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=950.3399999999999s)]
*  No, the real question would be does [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=951.5799999999999s)]
*  a murderer have a right to continue [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=952.9799999999999s)]
*  doing murders? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=954.6999999999999s)]
*  And the answer is no. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=955.8199999999999s)]
*  If a state is a criminal enterprise, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=957.62s)]
*  then that state must cease its [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=959.98s)]
*  criminality. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=961.62s)]
*  And genocide is the worst crime [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=962.86s)]
*  that you can commit. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=965.46s)]
*  The fuck? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=966.82s)]
*  This is very, very, very dumb. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=967.74s)]
*  You're conflating criminality [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=971.1800000000001s)]
*  and the right to exist as a murderer [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=972.66s)]
*  have a right to exist. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=974.02s)]
*  I would say yes is stupid. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=974.9s)]
*  What you are actually asking while [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=976.78s)]
*  you're saying does a murderer have [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=978.5s)]
*  a right to exist is does a murderer [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=979.58s)]
*  have a right to continue doing [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=981.5s)]
*  murders? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=982.94s)]
*  And I think you and I both know the [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=983.66s)]
*  answer is no. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=985.26s)]
*  Because Israel as a nation state [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=987.62s)]
*  from its inception all the way to [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=990.38s)]
*  the 77th year formation has been a [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=992.9s)]
*  nation state that is is doing a [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=996.58s)]
*  genocide, ethnic cleansing of the [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=999.42s)]
*  indigenous population, land grabs, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1001.54s)]
*  exterminationist policies built [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1003.62s)]
*  around the notion of [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1006.14s)]
*  ethno-religious supremacy. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1008.54s)]
*  And no, that is completely a [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1010.62s)]
*  murderous and illegal enterprise. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1012.9s)]
*  So no, like, do you think, do you [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1015.58s)]
*  think, do you think, OK, in the [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1018.1800000000001s)]
*  aftermath of the Holocaust, if [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1020.74s)]

*  apparatus for Western Empire, if [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1027.06s)]
*  people were like migrating to this [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1029.3400000000001s)]

*  people that survived this process, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1041.82s)]
*  like, let's build a fully formed [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1043.34s)]

*  they don't like it when the answer [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1072.42s)]
*  is anything other than a yes or no. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1073.38s)]
*  What happened is that last month he [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1075.22s)]
*  got forced into a yes or no [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1076.5400000000002s)]

*  When asked if he believes Israel is [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1081.8600000000001s)]

*  him to answer the question. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1091.74s)]
*  I mean, yeah, the free press is [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1092.46s)]
*  literally a fucking a Zionist dishrag. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1094.18s)]
*  Who gives a fuck what they have to say? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1097.42s)]
*  Zoran has consistently recognized [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1099.8200000000002s)]

*  want to say no, because they'll just [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1106.5s)]
*  clip it after he says no to be like [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1109.26s)]
*  he wants the genocide. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1111.3799999999999s)]
*  All Jews look at him. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1112.54s)]
*  Look at this scary Muslim man. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1114.26s)]
*  He wants the genocide. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1115.78s)]
*  All Jews, which is why the answer [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1116.5s)]
*  there should be what he was trying [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1119.34s)]
*  to establish over and over again. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1121.8999999999999s)]
*  Follow the fucking law. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1124.62s)]
*  People exist. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1127.02s)]
*  States already exist. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1128.62s)]

*  then no, they don't get to exist. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1133.66s)]
*  It's that simple. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1135.02s)]
*  Listen, you and I have talked about [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1136.5s)]
*  this war in Gaza for ever since it [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1138.06s)]
*  started, this phase of the 75 year [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1141.6200000000001s)]
*  conflict. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1144.3400000000001s)]
*  I just say you were going to vote [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1144.9s)]
*  for the guy over a three second clip. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1146.02s)]
*  I mean, there is not a single person [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1147.6200000000001s)]
*  that is as close to power as Zoran [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1150.38s)]
*  Mamdani is that has his his level of [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1152.46s)]
*  precision when talking about [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1155.9s)]
*  Israel's criminality. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1158.14s)]
*  OK, so this is the reason why I say [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1159.42s)]
*  like, yeah, it's a fucking bad answer. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1162.1000000000001s)]
*  But that doesn't change my my [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1164.66s)]
*  support for him at all. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1168.26s)]
*  And I have resisted going as far as [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1170.5400000000002s)]
*  you have done in your criticism [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1174.14s)]
*  of the Israeli government. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1176.38s)]
*  I got to resist no more. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1177.42s)]
*  I think we've reached common ground [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1179.7s)]
*  about what we view is happening [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1181.5s)]
*  and has been happening through this [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1183.5800000000002s)]
*  period of this blockade, which, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1185.22s)]
*  frankly, is just starvation of the [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1186.78s)]
*  people there, including so many [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1189.02s)]
*  innocent young women and children. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1190.94s)]
*  And I think that the incessant bombing [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1193.66s)]
*  and killing, and we don't know how many [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1195.86s)]
*  civilians have been killed, but it is on [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1197.5s)]
*  a daily basis. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1198.94s)]
*  It looks like hundreds of people every [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1199.78s)]
*  day with no apparent attempt, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1201.38s)]
*  it seems to me, to have any real plan [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1203.82s)]
*  for how this ends or what happens when [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1206.22s)]
*  it ends, other than if you look at what [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1208.78s)]
*  Smodrich has been saying, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1211.14s)]
*  probably the most right wing member [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1213.26s)]
*  of a very right wing government. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1215.1799999999998s)]
*  He is talking in a genocidal language [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1217.1s)]
*  about kicking all the Palestinians out. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1219.54s)]
*  So I think you and I have reached a place [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1221.8999999999999s)]
*  in the last few weeks where we are [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1224.58s)]
*  in agreement. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1226.78s)]
*  But my question of you, Mehdi, is... [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1227.7s)]
*  I don't know the answer to that question, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1229.8999999999999s)]
*  Piers, and I'm glad we're in agreement. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1231.1799999999998s)]
*  I wish we weren't. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1232.74s)]
*  Actually, I wish I had been wrong. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1233.8999999999999s)]
*  And you were right. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1235.4199999999998s)]
*  I wish that a year ago when I said on [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1236.1799999999998s)]
*  your show, you said, well, if it's not [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1237.58s)]
*  about the hostages, what's it about? [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1238.74s)]
*  And I said it's about depopulating Gaza. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1240.1s)]
*  It's about conquering Gaza. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1241.94s)]
*  I wish I'd been wrong. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1243.26s)]
*  But as you said, Bezalel Smodrich, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1244.34s)]
*  the finance minister in the Israeli government, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1245.82s)]
*  said this week, we are there to conquer, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1248.1s)]
*  cleanse, and remain. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1250.54s)]
*  Those are his words. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1252.3s)]
*  We are disassembling Gaza, he said. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1253.1399999999999s)]
*  We are leaving it as piles of rubble. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1255.22s)]
*  He says we're doing something that no one's done [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1257.94s)]
*  in the world before. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1259.4199999999998s)]
*  He bragged out loud. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1260.26s)]
*  And he said, yes, the Gazans will have to leave. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1261.86s)]
*  So all of those things are stuff some of us [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1263.6599999999999s)]
*  were saying last year. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1265.54s)]
*  I wish we hadn't been vindicated in this horrific way. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1266.3799999999999s)]
*  The killing is ongoing. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1268.94s)]
*  The starvation is ongoing. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1270.02s)]
*  And look, I do hope that a dam is bursting. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1271.74s)]
*  You mentioned the genocide word. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1274.82s)]
*  Shmuel Lederman, who is an Israeli researcher of genocide, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1276.8600000000001s)]
*  spent much of 2024 saying it's not a genocide, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1279.3400000000001s)]
*  it's not a genocide. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1281.7s)]
*  He was interviewed by a Dutch newspaper last week. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1282.74s)]
*  He said, I've changed my position. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1284.6200000000001s)]
*  It is a genocide. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1285.9s)]
*  He said, in my field, there's a consensus [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1286.8600000000001s)]
*  among genocide scholars that it's a genocide. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1288.98s)]
*  In fact, that Dutch newspaper interviewed seven leading [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1291.1000000000001s)]
*  scholars of genocide. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1293.46s)]
*  Every single one said, we think what's happening [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1294.38s)]
*  in Gaza is a genocide. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1296.26s)]
*  In fact, this week, Piers, you have an Israeli former general, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1297.54s)]
*  Yair Golan, saying a same country does not attack civilians. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1300.34s)]
*  Yeah, Yair Golan had to fucking apologize though, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1305.62s)]
*  to be fair. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1308.06s)]
*  Does not kill babies as a hobby [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1309.78s)]
*  and does not expel civilian populations. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1312.34s)]
*  That is Yair Golan, the former deputy chief [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1314.78s)]
*  of the Israeli military, prominent Israeli policy. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1316.78s)]
*  He was a hero on October the 7th. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1318.8999999999999s)]
*  Fort Hamas himself on October the 7th. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1320.1399999999999s)]
*  This is what he said this week. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1322.54s)]
*  Chuck Schumer's a fucking fanatic [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1324.1s)]
*  and it is a goddamn joke that he's even a member [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1325.6999999999998s)]
*  of a leftist inner party in a democracy. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1327.5s)]
*  There's a sign we live in hell that he leads it [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1329.02s)]
*  and that no one beneath him can point out how unfit he is [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1331.42s)]
*  with his hysterical attitude towards the UN. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1334.3799999999999s)]
*  This is from the interview. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1336.62s)]
*  This was such a psychotic thing that he said [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1338.58s)]

*  I know exactly what this quote is [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1345.22s)]
*  because I've read it on stream when we read the interview [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1346.46s)]
*  that he conducted here. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1349.26s)]
*  This is when he's trying to fucking shill his book. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1350.82s)]
*  His book that was around the, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1353.58s)]
*  the left's antisemitism. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1359.18s)]
*  He's just like, he's like, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1361.42s)]
*  there's a perfect opportunity. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1363.3s)]
*  There is a perfect opportunity to fucking pop off [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1365.46s)]
*  on the antisemitism, the true antisemitism of the country, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1368.54s)]
*  which is of course the left's antisemitism. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1371.86s)]
*  That's what Chuck Schumer's book is all about, right? [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1374.3799999999999s)]
*  Thank God. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1377.86s)]
*  Thank God he wrote this book. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1378.7s)]
*  Definitely a book for the times. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1381.02s)]
*  Norm said his book was ass. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1383.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's putting it lightly. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1385.06s)]
*  Anyway, let's see, let's see what he, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1387.06s)]
*  let's see what he had to say here. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1389.74s)]
*  So yes, it's very emotional. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1392.54s)]
*  And to almost all Jewish people, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1394.74s)]
*  we all have relatives and we know about this has happened. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1397.4199999999998s)]
*  Again, genocide is a vicious, vicious word to use. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1401.78s)]
*  I will say it's a word [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1407.4199999999998s)]
*  that a UN special committee has used. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1408.94s)]
*  Please, the UN has been an anti-Israel. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1411.58s)]
*  Anti-Semitically against Israel doubles. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1417.58s)]
*  Like this is, this is abhorrent, this is repugnant, dude. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1419.86s)]
*  You are such a fucking freak. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1426.22s)]
*  The UN is antisemitically against Israel? [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1429.26s)]
*  Shut the fuck up, you fucking bitch. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1433.1399999999999s)]
*  God damn. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1437.62s)]
*  Of course, the expectation from someone like Chuck Schumer [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1439.1799999999998s)]
*  is obviously not going to be all that much [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1441.62s)]
*  considering that he is a APEC lep. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1444.74s)]
*  Okay, go ahead, call me antisemitic for saying this. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1448.78s)]
*  But a guy who consistently speaks at APEC [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1452.46s)]
*  and fucking says, you know, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1457.06s)]
*  the Bible gave the Jews Judea and Samaria 3,000 years ago [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1459.26s)]
*  and Palestinians don't believe that [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1464.78s)]
*  because they're Muslim and Christian. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1467.26s)]
*  And therefore there is no conversation to be had with them [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1470.02s)]
*  is just as fucking genocidal as Itamar Ben-Givir is. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1474.14s)]
*  Okay, this has nothing to do with him being Jewish [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1478.3000000000002s)]
*  and everything to do with him being a fucking freak. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1481.5s)]
*  God, he sucks so bad. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1484.5400000000002s)]

*  To say that the Jewish people should. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1498.14s)]
*  Yeah, Zionism is racism. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1500.7800000000002s)]

*  But not apparently all the Hamas fighters. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1698.1s)]

*  when you fought the Nazi Germany. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1713.26s)]
*  You know, you can speak about civilian casualties [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1715.34s)]
*  and you can speak. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1717.74s)]
*  See, look, if I'm a fucking Israeli envoy, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1718.58s)]
*  well, first of all, if I was, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1721.34s)]
*  I'd do the right thing and follow the leader, okay? [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1723.1s)]
*  But let's say I'm a hypothetically, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1727.3s)]
*  in a hypothetical situation, I'm an Israeli envoy. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1728.94s)]
*  You know what I'm not bringing up? [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1730.74s)]
*  Dresden, because of the closeness of Israel [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1732.18s)]
*  to Nazi Germany in this equation, okay? [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1736.1000000000001s)]
*  Because you just keep reminding people [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1739.5s)]
*  of like what the allied forces did in Dresden [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1742.5800000000002s)]
*  and considering how close Israel is, both ideologically [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1745.98s)]
*  and also in practice to the fucking mechanized death [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1749.8200000000002s)]
*  that took place in the Holocaust [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1752.7800000000002s)]
*  in the hands of Nazi Germany, [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1754.98s)]
*  you probably shouldn't remind people [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1757.5s)]
*  what people did to stop Nazi Germany. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1759.58s)]
*  That's all I'm saying, okay? [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1762.6599999999999s)]
*  Because it's weird that you keep reminding people [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1764.74s)]
*  what it took for the Nazis to stop [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1768.8999999999999s)]
*  and we are in unprecedented times [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1772.06s)]
*  where a lot more people are aware [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1775.46s)]
*  of who the Nazi Germany equivalent is in this situation. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1777.9399999999998s)]
*  That's all I'm saying, nothing else. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1782.98s)]
*  It's the same thing that I brought up [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1786.4199999999998s)]
*  after Israel was trying to do the Hamas is ISIS, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1787.94s)]
*  ISIS is Hamas and it's like, [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1792.5s)]
*  like you're just reminding people [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1795.66s)]
*  what took place in Dresden, [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1797.02s)]
*  like what it took to stop Nazi Germany [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1798.18s)]
*  at a time when more and more people are recognizing [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1801.54s)]
*  that like Israel is quite similar to Nazi Germany, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1804.1000000000001s)]
*  you know, like weird, weird thing, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1807.8600000000001s)]
*  weird route to take, I perhaps would not take that. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1810.26s)]
*  I would probably talk about like, you know, [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1814.26s)]
*  restitution and being kind to war criminals or something. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1816.1s)]
*  Like at this point, at this point, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1820.1s)]
*  I think that's the route that Israeli envoys [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1824.1799999999998s)]
*  should be taking. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1827.78s)]
*  Think about tens of thousands of people who died [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1830.02s)]
*  in your efforts to fight evil. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1832.6599999999999s)]
*  Today we are fighting the same evil force. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1834.86s)]
*  It's not easy, it's hard, we are in pain, [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1837.62s)]
*  but we are determined to finish the job. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1840.1s)]
*  We will not idly by against Israel [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1842.34s)]
*  because we know nobody will be there to protect us. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1844.5s)]
*  Today we have a country. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1846.58s)]
*  Dude, also saying this is so, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1848.1000000000001s)]
*  like saying this, saying this on British broadcasters, [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1850.58s)]
*  like saying this on the British broadcasting network [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1856.3400000000001s)]
*  is so gross because like, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1861.02s)]
*  what do you mean no one will protect us? [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1864.58s)]
*  The fucking, the UK government, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1866.3400000000001s)]
*  or the British government has literally given surveillance [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1868.46s)]
*  to the Israeli state illegally in secrecy, okay? [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1873.1s)]
*  Since the beginning of Israel's genocide. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1877.74s)]
*  The British government is directly aiding and abetting [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1880.74s)]
*  the genocide of the Palestinians. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1884.82s)]
*  So is the American government. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1886.58s)]
*  Without Western coalition forces defending Israel [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1888.1s)]
*  every step of the way, [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1893.1s)]
*  Israel would not be able to do this fucking genocide. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1894.26s)]
*  Like the arrogance, the entitlement, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1896.98s)]
*  the oh Israel is all along, [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1899.1399999999999s)]
*  Israel is doing the job that no one wants to do. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1901.6599999999999s)]
*  We are all alone. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1904.62s)]
*  It's like, come on, man. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1905.62s)]
*  Come the fuck on, dude. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1907.1399999999999s)]
*  Come the fuck on. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1908.3799999999999s)]
*  You're out of your goddamn mind. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1909.6599999999999s)]
*  60% of reconnaissance missions over Gaza are done by UK. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1912.4199999999998s)]
*  I don't know if that number is correct. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1914.54s)]
*  60% it seems way too high. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1915.9399999999998s)]
*  I'm sure there's more US involvement in the reconnaissance. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1918.86s)]
*  Why is British media turning against Israel suddenly? [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1922.26s)]
*  Because they got the permission. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1924.26s)]
*  They got the boss call. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1925.6599999999999s)]
*  All it took was for David Lammy's bitch ass [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1927.3s)]
*  to turn around and be like, [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1929.58s)]
*  what's happening in Israel? [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1930.94s)]
*  What's happening in Gaza is unconscionable. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1932.58s)]
*  That's it. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1934.86s)]
*  That's it. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1935.7s)]
*  That's all it took was these fucking charlatans [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1936.54s)]
*  in Western media, all it took, [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1940.66s)]
*  please stop that Jewish voice. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1943.58s)]
*  What the fuck do you mean? [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1945.38s)]
*  The Jewish voice. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1946.78s)]
*  This is not a Jewish voice. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1947.9s)]
*  This is a very specific Middle Eastern accent [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1949.1s)]
*  that I'm doing, okay? [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1952.98s)]
*  An accent that takes many forms, [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1954.34s)]
*  oftentimes doesn't sound anything like other accents [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1957.18s)]
*  from the region, okay? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1961.18s)]
*  Here, I'll give you another version of this. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1962.74s)]
*  Israel has a right to defend itself [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1965.6200000000001s)]
*  after 19 months of genocide. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1969.74s)]
*  Another organic, natural, beautiful Middle Eastern accent. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1972.42s)]
*  Okay? [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1978.7s)]

*  The other one is the one that you're hearing on screen. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1982.98s)]
*  Another one is, [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1986.66s)]
*  it sounds quite similar to the Philadelphia accent. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1989.22s)]
*  You know, like Israel has a right to defend itself. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1994.3400000000001s)]
*  Another accent that you hear in the region, okay? [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=1999.78s)]
*  Very similar to Philadelphia for some reason. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=2005.78s)]
*  I don't know what it is. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=2007.8200000000002s)]

*  I can't stop myself. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=2011.42s)]
*  The other one was Scottish. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=2013.98s)]
*  That's interesting that you're saying that that's Scottish. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=2016.1000000000001s)]
*  It's a Middle Eastern regional dialect. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=2017.42s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=2019.7800000000002s)]

*  Israel number one, Israel number one. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=2024.9s)]
*  Hamas, we must kill the Hamas babies of terror. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=2028.42s)]
*  The days when Jews were massacred [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=2033.42s)]
*  and there was no response are over. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=2035.1000000000001s)]
*  The day that we asked for support [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=2037.14s)]

*  and that's exactly what we are doing. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=2043.5400000000002s)]
*  We didn't start this war, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=2046.06s)]
*  but we intend to finish it without Hamas. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=2046.9s)]
*  Here's another organic natural accent from the region. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=2050.54s)]
*  Khalil, no! [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=2055.98s)]

*  It takes many different forms. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=2059.46s)]
*  A lot of you think like, oh, you, [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=2060.98s)]
*  instead of saying the, [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmygBoosuY&t=2063.9s)]
