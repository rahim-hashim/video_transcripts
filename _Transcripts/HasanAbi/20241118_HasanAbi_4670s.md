**HasanAbi:** [November 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs)
*  He is legit a lawyer? Yeah, brother. He went to law school and went into private practice for a year [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=0.0s)]
*  and then immediately ran for office. So no, he does not have legitimate lawyer bonafides at all. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=6.72s)]
*  That is ridiculous. Okay. Having a law degree does not make you a legitimate fucking lawyer. Okay. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=13.84s)]
*  Chunk Weiger, my uncle, okay. Shaky Gurga, Cenk Uygur also has a law degree. I don't think he should be attorney general. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=20.72s)]

*  incredibly fucked up sometimes like, you know, criminal things like violating statutory rape [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=179.68s)]
*  laws and things of that nature. It's not just, it's not always just like, it's not always just [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=188.4s)]
*  people who swing. Okay. It's funny when they're like bisexual swingers, as long as they are [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=193.44s)]
*  engaging in consensual acts of sexual intercourse. However, there are a lot of, there are a lot of [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=199.84s)]
*  people in those, in those circles that also do a shit ton of non-consensual things, illegal things, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=206.72s)]
*  and they get arrested for it. As a matter of fact, ESL moment, what's a swinger? Swingers are people [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=216.16s)]
*  who, you know, engage in group sex or, you know, swap partners and stuff. You might remind people [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=221.28s)]

*  inside of Russia thing later. I don't know. I have seen the latest from bad empanada. I'm not [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=236.39999999999998s)]
*  going to watch it, dude, please. Okay. Please. All right. We're going to talk about Pete Hegseth. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=241.83999999999997s)]
*  Mainstream media is at this point, like a week late. There are a week late on these stories that [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=247.92s)]
*  I uncovered immediately after the Pete Hegseth nom. They're talking about, they're talking about [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=253.36s)]
*  the settlement that Pete Hegseth engaged in with a woman who credibly accused him of, and also the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=260.72s)]
*  tattoos that he has that caused him to not participate in the inauguration, even though [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=267.76s)]
*  he's a part of the national guard. Why was he not allowed to participate in the inauguration as a [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=273.68s)]
*  part of the national guard? Because he has right-wing extremist Christian fundamentalist tattoos. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=280.24s)]
*  He has the deus vault tattoo on his arm and he has the Jerusalem cross on his chest. Both of these [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=285.68s)]
*  are white nationalist, Christian nationalist tattoos. Many have these tattoos. It's not, think, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=291.76s)]
*  it's not as aggressive or as overt as like a black son or a swastika, but it's more in line with, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=298.96000000000004s)]
*  you know, source. Well, you're about to see it in a second. It's so funny to go source on Christian [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=309.6s)]
*  nationalist tattoos because it's on his body. Like it's literally on his body. And not only is it on [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=315.76000000000005s)]
*  his body, he wrote an entire book about how pissed he was that they wouldn't let him participate in [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=323.84000000000003s)]
*  the inauguration because of his tattoos. Not only did he write a book about it, but he also personally [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=330.08000000000004s)]
*  talked to Sean Ryan. No, they are not Lamau with the Jerusalem cross and deus vault. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=336.48s)]
*  Aren't Christian nationalist tattoos. What are you talking about? Also, Pete Hegson himself is a [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=342.56s)]
*  rabid Christian fundamentalist, a rabid Christian nationalist. He has openly said his, his, you know, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=349.28000000000003s)]
*  incredibly desires time and time again on camera and at numerous conferences as well. I covered [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=357.92s)]
*  a lot of this stuff multiple times throughout the past couple of weeks at this point. So you can go [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=366.15999999999997s)]
*  and look at my coverage on the matter. Also, 2024 Kanye is a very funny name for a person to be like, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=372.15999999999997s)]
*  Oh, I don't understand what you mean about the deus vault. Donald Trump, his choices for his [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=379.76s)]
*  cabinet are coming under increasing fire, possibly facing confirmation battles in the Republican [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=384.56s)]
*  controlled Senate. Chief White House correspondent, Mary Bruce's at Mar-a-Lago. Good morning, Mary. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=389.03999999999996s)]
*  Good morning, George. Well, Donald Trump ran as a disruptor promising to shatter the status quo. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=393.6s)]
*  And based on his cabinet picks, he intends to make good on that promise if he can get them confirmed. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=398.56s)]
*  President elect Donald Trump Saturday at an ultimate fighting championship event alongside [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=404.08000000000004s)]
*  controversial members of his new team. As this morning, Trump is gearing up for his own fight [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=409.20000000000005s)]
*  to get his cabinet picks confirmed. These are disruptors. They are, I think that's by design. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=414.56s)]
*  Questions continue to grow over Trump's choice for defense secretary. Fox News host Pete Hegseth, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=420.16s)]
*  his attorney confirming Hegseth paid a woman who accused him of in 2017 as part of a settlement [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=426.16s)]
*  agreement, though claiming the encounter was consensual. Trump was made aware of the incident [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=432.32000000000005s)]
*  shortly after he named Hegseth to the position and is standing by him. His team saying that Hegseth [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=437.84000000000003s)]
*  has vigorously denied any and all accusations and no charges were filed. We look forward to [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=443.44000000000005s)]
*  his confirmation. Hegseth is also under fire for some of his tattoos. Hash Brown 221. Thank you for [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=449.2s)]
*  the 521. Give the subs. How are they disruptors when they staff basically the entirety of the [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=455.28s)]
*  apparatus? Yeah, they're not real disruptors. I guess there are certain aspects of it that is [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=462.08s)]
*  disruptive. Having someone like Pete Hegseth run the DOD is unique. OK, it is unique because he [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=467.2s)]
*  does not have the adequate experience. Like he is now placed on top of an organization that is [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=476.08s)]
*  literally in charge of three million employees. OK, that's crazy. You can't have someone who is a [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=482.08s)]
*  weekend Fox News host do that job like out of nowhere. He does not have adequate work experience. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=489.68s)]
*  OK, like that's crazy. That is like that is definitely disruptive. OK, having said or Matt [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=496.56s)]
*  Gates has no relevant experience with the exception of being in the crosshairs of the legal system. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=503.52s)]
*  OK, the only relevant experience Matt Gates has to be attorney general is that he has been [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=509.28s)]
*  investigated by the Department of Justice. That's it. OK, like that's insane. That's an insane thing [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=515.04s)]
*  to do to put him in the top cop slot. OK, the day's vault slogan has been used by perpetrators [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=522.24s)]
*  of right wing and it was repeatedly used by the perpetrator of the twenty seventeen Quebec City [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=530.96s)]
*  Moss shooting and was one of the tattoos on the body of the perpetrator of the twenty twenty three [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=534.08s)]
*  Allen Texas outlet mall shooting day's vault was among the slogans and symbols used during the [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=537.6s)]
*  far right right of Charlottesville, Virginia in twenty seventeen. Yes, he is legit a lawyer. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=542.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, brother. He went to law school and went into private practice for a year and then immediately [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=547.36s)]
*  ran for office. So no, he does not have legitimate lawyer bona fides at all. That is ridiculous. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=553.76s)]
*  OK, having a law degree does not make you a legitimate lawyer. OK, Chunk Weiger, my uncle, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=561.2s)]
*  OK, shaky Gerga, Cenk Uygur also has a law degree. I don't think he should be attorney general. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=568.88s)]
*  Except he would still be more qualified than Matt Gates because he hasn't, you know, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=579.12s)]
*  done illegal shit. His only litigation experience was suing his dad's friend or some shit for health [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=583.84s)]
*  benefits depicting religious symbols and phrases that fellow service members flagged to his [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=588.72s)]
*  superiors over concerns they're associated with white supremacists. Hegseth saying those concerns [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=593.76s)]
*  amount to anti-Christian bigotry posting. They can target. That's crazy. Get me. I don't. That's [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=599.9200000000001s)]
*  crazy. This is anti-Christian bigotry. Once again, the day is vault tattoo. OK, here, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=606.96s)]
*  let's look at Wikipedia. OK, let's let's resort to my favorite, my favorite website. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=615.1999999999999s)]
*  Wikipedia is vault is a Christian motto relating to divine providence. It was first chanted by [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=620.88s)]
*  Catholics during the first crusade as a rallying cry, most likely under the form days, the vault [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=626.56s)]
*  or deus lo vault as reported by just the Frank Coram. OK, in modern times, the Latin motto has [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=634.0s)]
*  different meanings depending on the context. It has been used as a metaphor referring to God's [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=641.36s)]
*  will by Christians throughout history, such as the Puritans. The modern application is an adoption [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=645.52s)]
*  by right wing groups as a slogan. Deus vault has been adopted by a slogan by a variety of Christian [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=651.92s)]
*  right and Christian nationalist groups, as well as alt right and white supremacist groups. This [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=656.64s)]
*  image, this usage was disseminated widely online through hashtags and internet memes, crusader memes [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=660.96s)]
*  such as an image of a knight Templar accompanied by the caption, I'll see your jihad and raise you [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=666.64s)]
*  one crusade are popular on far right internet pages. It is one of the several pieces of crusader [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=671.4399999999999s)]
*  imagery used by groups characterized in the Washington Post as far right Christian nationalists [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=677.12s)]
*  and dominionists. One perspective is that racist movements co-opt the slogans and iconography of [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=682.08s)]
*  the European medieval period to evoke a fantasy of a pure white European heritage, a nostalgic [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=686.96s)]
*  view that is historically inaccurate and has been denounced by medievalist scholars as a gross [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=693.04s)]
*  distortion of history. Okay. What is hilarious about this is that it also, it also runs with [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=698.24s)]

*  conversation because like parts of what Robert F. Kennedy says about American food is objectively [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1565.52s)]
*  correct. Okay. Parts about regulatory capture also correct. He is the worst person to say it, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1571.28s)]
*  however, and the media also routinely drops the ball. One passage that is burned into my mind [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1579.12s)]
*  was when RFK jr. Was talking about like, I guess, fruit loops or whatever and how different it is [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1586.56s)]
*  in Canada, right? His, his assessment on certain fronts is completely correct, but his solution is [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1592.24s)]
*  incorrect. Okay. That's number one. Number two, when he talks about fruit loops in America versus [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1600.08s)]
*  fruit loops in Canada, he'll say, Oh, they have, you know, only two ingredients. He's wrong about [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1605.12s)]
*  that. Right. And Canada is not just two ingredients, but the media will turn around and say, and I can't [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1610.32s)]
*  fuck. What was the article? Like I need to find this piece that was criticizing RFK's fruit loop [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1615.52s)]
*  conversation. Okay. Where they were like, the difference between the difference between fruit [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1622.0s)]
*  loops in Canada and the chemicals that are used in fruit loops in the United States of America. Oh, [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1630.32s)]
*  here, this is it. This is what I was talking about. Thank you. Mr. Kennedy has singled out fruit loops [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1637.12s)]
*  as an example of a product with too many artificial ingredients, questioning why the Canadian version [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1641.52s)]
*  is fewer than the U S version, but he was wrong. The ingredients list is roughly the same. Although [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1645.12s)]
*  Canada has natural colorings made from blueberries and carrots, while the U S product contains red [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1649.04s)]
*  dye 40 yellow five and blue one, as well as butylated hydroxyl toluene or BHD, a lab made [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1653.2s)]
*  chemical that is used for freshness according to the ingredient label. So it's not the same thing. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1660.08s)]
*  Like, what are we doing? What the fuck is the fact check here? So everyone on every side of the [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1664.6399999999999s)]
*  equation is speck is failing spectacularly. RFK jr identifies a commonly held position that he is [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1671.36s)]
*  championing here and gaining prominence. The media is not accurately covering the frustration that I [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1680.24s)]
*  have, for example, with what RFK jr is presenting as a solution to the problem. Okay. And the issue, [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1689.12s)]
*  the issue with the circumstances is like, when they write stuff like this, people read it and go, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1696.3999999999999s)]
*  what the fuck are you saying? Like, yeah, no, that's what he's pointing to. Like, you can't say [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1700.64s)]
*  these two things are the same with some minor differences. And then the minor differences [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1706.88s)]
*  is exactly what he's pointing to. The real problem here isn't RFK saying he wants to make food [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1712.4s)]
*  healthy. That's a good and honorable goal. The real problem is he is not going to do that [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1717.76s)]
*  with this current administration. Okay, because his solution is deregulation, not correct regulation [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1725.04s)]
*  and anti corruption, but instead deregulation. When you deregulate, you don't arrive magically [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1732.32s)]
*  at a Canadian style fucking a form of a regulatory agency. They have more regulation there. They have [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1740.16s)]
*  more regulation in Europe. That's the reason why they don't have these fucking chemicals in their [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1748.88s)]
*  food. And it's not even just these chemicals. Okay, it's not there are massive, massive problems [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1755.2800000000002s)]
*  with the food that Americans consume. New York Times edited the article because of the tweet. Oh, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1763.3600000000001s)]
*  shit. Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article incorrectly described Mr. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1769.3600000000001s)]
*  Kennedy's recent comments on fruit loops. He was comparing the total number of ingredients in the [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1773.0400000000002s)]
*  US and Canadian version of the cereal, not the number of artificial ingredients. It's sad because [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1776.1599999999999s)]
*  it's sad because I eat very healthy with the exception of the diet sodas that I consume [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1781.76s)]
*  that are not entirely unhealthy, or there's a lot of fucking back and forth on, you know, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1787.9199999999998s)]
*  how unhealthy some of these chemicals are. Okay. But overall, overall, okay, I eat a healthy balanced [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1793.6799999999998s)]
*  diet that I track. Okay, pretty aggressively. I track my micronutrients. I track my macronutrients. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1802.8s)]
*  I try to make up for specific micronutrients that I might not be getting from my my diet overall. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1810.08s)]
*  crumble cookie is so stupid. Yes, dude. It's normal to fucking, you know, go crazy sometimes. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1818.24s)]
*  Like what are you talking about? Eating one eating crumble cookie over the week, eating a couple [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1823.44s)]
*  crumble cookies over the weekend, while it's packed to the fucking gills with sugar is like [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1828.4s)]
*  eating unhealthy. Every now and then is not going to kill you. Okay. That is literally a part of [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1833.1200000000001s)]
*  moderation. It's fine. You can do that. Okay. And I say this as someone who, you know, is very careful [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1839.52s)]
*  about what I eat. Jesus Christ. Super healthy. Said in front of a literal tower of nicotine. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1846.16s)]
*  Nicotine is an infinitely healthier substitute to tobacco products. What are we talking about? I mean, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1851.44s)]
*  come on, don't make me don't make me have this conversation over and over again. Okay, everything [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1855.52s)]
*  in moderation, everything in fucking moderation. God forbid a grown man has a sweet treat every [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1860.16s)]
*  now and then exactly. Thank you. Anyway, the point is, the point is, I say this as someone who also, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1864.48s)]
*  you know, splurges every now and then, I say this as someone who has changed my my diet, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1870.72s)]
*  specifically so that I can have a sweet treat at the end of the day, an ice cream sandwich. Okay. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1878.56s)]
*  And the results speak for themselves. Okay. I went from being 285 pounds and losing all of my [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1884.72s)]
*  muscle mass at the peak of COVID lockdowns to 225 pounds. And, you know, getting back all of that [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1892.8s)]
*  muscle mass. I say, this is someone who works out every single day of the week. I train, I weight lift [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1901.52s)]
*  and I train four times a week. I do cardio and play basketball three times a week. Okay, I care [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1908.48s)]
*  about this shit. So it is very frustrating. When I hear about I hear from people who don't care about [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1915.6s)]
*  this shit, who spread a fuck ton of misinformation on it. Okay. The problem is it's different strokes [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1923.28s)]
*  for different folks. And our entire food industry is, for example, heavily subsidized, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1930.96s)]
*  due to heavy subsidies on corn products, we utilize high fructose corn syrup. This is part of the [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1939.92s)]
*  reason why America has a diabetes epidemic. This is the reason why America has an obesity epidemic. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1946.0s)]
*  Another part of the problem is, another part of the problem with our highly processed foods is that [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1951.68s)]
*  there are plenty of food deserts. And also none of our cities are fucking walkable. We have a car [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1958.0s)]
*  reliant infrastructure. If you look to countries that have adequate public transit, people are [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1963.04s)]
*  walking around a lot more. Okay. When you walk around a lot more, you are forced to, you know, [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1968.8s)]
*  have a healthier lifestyle overall. That's it. Like these are broad generalizations, but these [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1975.68s)]
*  are broad generalizations. But you know, there is, there's truth to what I am speaking of here. Okay. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1981.36s)]
*  All of these things play a big role in the obesity epidemic in the United States of America. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1986.88s)]
*  Okay. I hate this shit. I hate the coverage of it. And I hate that like, RFK Jr. is considered a [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=1995.2s)]
*  champion of health when he is, you know, genuinely anti-medicine and in certain instances, anti-science. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2002.5600000000002s)]
*  Who is one of the biggest deniers of vaccines in our country would undermine the confidence in [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2011.6s)]
*  that program and likely would cost lives. Even the conservative editorial board of the Rupert Murdoch [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2017.84s)]
*  owned New York Post writing the overriding rule of medicine is first do no harm. We are [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2023.84s)]
*  certain installing Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to head health and human services breaks this rule. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2030.0s)]
*  Kennedy, who has railed against processed foods and criticized Trump's diet, seen this weekend [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2035.76s)]

*  and notably wrote a chapter of the project 2025 policy book on how he would run the FCC. The big [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2051.12s)]
*  question for all of these nominees, of course, can they get confirmed in the Senate? And if not, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2056.72s)]
*  will Trump urge the Senate to waive its confirmation responsibilities to push them [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2061.92s)]
*  through via recess appointments? George? Yes, this is a real test of the Republican [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2065.52s)]

*  ice structure. There's simply not enough people to be able to engage in this. And now he is talking [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2089.3599999999997s)]
*  about deploying the American military on us soil. This is legitimately terrifying. Okay. I mean, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2095.12s)]
*  this is app. I'm eagerly waiting for an apology from my dad who said this was just a campaign [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2104.4s)]

*  to launch the largest deportation operation in the history of our country to use the military as [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2134.8799999999997s)]

*  plans and prepares for office, he's also facing a fight in Washington on some of the picks for [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2152.0s)]

*  as we speak. Yeah. I'm technically I am on the list. I think of, you know, potential deportation [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2169.76s)]
*  nominees, but I'm on the tail end for certain it for, for certain parts of my commentary. I'm on [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2180.24s)]
*  the first in line, but for other parts of my denaturalization process, I'm on the end of the [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2186.8799999999997s)]
*  line. So, you know, being openly anti-Israel puts me in the top slot as a project. 2025 has a [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2193.8399999999997s)]
*  specific branch dedicated to project Esther, which dictates that they will go after anyone [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2201.68s)]

*  actively, actively work to deport them from the country. But on the other side, I'm on the tail [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2215.28s)]
*  end of the list. If I wasn't an outspoken critic of the nation state of Israel, I would be on the [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2222.88s)]
*  opposing side or not opposing, but on the other side of the deportation process, where I'd be in [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2228.88s)]
*  the last part of the denaturalization, the crazy stalkers don't need to know that. Yeah. Now people [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2233.76s)]

*  you know, yeah, what are you going to do? Take it up to the fucking Supreme court. What are the [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2260.08s)]
*  safeguards here? What are the safeguards that we currently have? What are the legal safeguards [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2264.0s)]

*  There are no checks and balances against this. The Supreme court is completely in the tank for [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2274.24s)]
*  Donald Trump. So much so that they've given Donald Trump additional protection from legal scrutiny. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2278.72s)]
*  Okay. So everything that he says he's going to do, look forward to him actually successfully [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2285.6s)]
*  implementing. Okay. There is no reason to believe that Donald Trump this time around is not going [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2291.2s)]
*  to be able to follow through with a lot of these promises. Yes. It goes hand in hand with how he [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2297.04s)]
*  wants to use the alien enemies act to turbocharge deportations. Trump is promising deportations [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2301.7599999999998s)]
*  under the alien enemies act of 1798. Okay. Former president Donald Trump, who's bid for the white [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2306.7999999999997s)]

*  network operating on American soil. He said at a recent rally in California, ironic and not [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2329.0400000000004s)]
*  ironically enough, a lot of the States, if they refuse to collaborate with the federal government [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2334.88s)]
*  on this sort of thing, refuse to give the federal government information on where migrants are, [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2343.84s)]
*  for example, undocumented migrants are, will trigger a massive constitutional crisis [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2349.6800000000003s)]
*  because then they would have to fight against each individual state. It would literally be civil war. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2357.44s)]
*  Trump is promising that if reelected, he will use the act to initiate a federal effort called [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2364.08s)]
*  operation Aurora named after the Colorado town that he claims has been taken over by Venezuelan [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2368.08s)]

*  party's official 2024 platform agenda 47, which says it will invoke the law to remove all known [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2392.56s)]
*  or suspected gang members, drug dealers, or cartel members in the United States, ending the scourge [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2398.48s)]
*  of illegal alien gang violence once and for all. Now, why is this important? Why is this important? [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2402.32s)]
*  Why are they using this kind of language before you say, Oh, excuse me. I don't want violent drug [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2408.16s)]
*  dealers to operate inside of our national boundaries. They are engaging in a direct [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2413.92s)]
*  violation of the law. The local law enforcement authorities that do collaborate when it comes to, [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2419.6s)]
*  you know, murders and drug dealing and, and federal offenses already do prosecute these people. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2425.7599999999998s)]
*  And then the federal government does deport them after the criminal trial is over saying, [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2432.88s)]
*  you're going to do this to suspected drug dealers opens up the boundaries of what the existing law [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2438.48s)]
*  is. Just so you understand, they're using MS-13 or trend, the trend, the Raguas, which is the new [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2445.52s)]
*  MS-13, the Venezuelan version to say they are going to go after every single migrant. They are [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2454.0s)]
*  not going to go after criminals because the government, the local authorities and the federal [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2460.4s)]
*  government already does go after criminals. Cry me a river. You say, Oh my God, for a lot of people [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2465.52s)]
*  that have completely checked out, I think of, you know, hoping that anything good will happen. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2473.04s)]
*  They are just running on f*****g fumes. Okay. They're angry. They don't know what the f**k they're [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2480.24s)]
*  angry about. And they are specifically saying, no, no, no, it's good. Let's just punish those who are [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2485.44s)]
*  even less fortunate than we are. And then maybe I will feel better. You will not feel better. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2491.2799999999997s)]
*  Okay. You will not feel better when this happens. You will actually suffer even more when this [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2497.12s)]
*  happens, especially when, if you are the most selfish person and don't give a f**k about the [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2504.4s)]
*  fact that this would mean that one in 15 families that are mixed status households would actually [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2509.7599999999998s)]

*  for no crime other than existing on US soil and participating in the American economy. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2522.16s)]
*  If you don't care about the inhumanity of that situation, you will care when your economy is [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2527.92s)]
*  imploding. Okay. It is ironic that so many people said they are voting for Donald Trump because of [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2533.52s)]
*  food prices, not realizing that undocumented migrants are responsible for damn near the [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2540.48s)]
*  entirety of America's agricultural production. This is precisely the reason why when Donald Trump [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2546.96s)]
*  uses the Bracero program or operation, you know, WB won't say it. Okay. That's what it was called [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2554.1600000000003s)]
*  when he hailed that as a, as a fantastic, you know, thing to do that he was going to bring back in a [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2561.2000000000003s)]
*  big way, right? Under the Eisenhower administration, the American government engaged in mass deportations [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2567.6s)]
*  of, engaged in mass deportations of 1.2 million, I believe, if not even more than that, mass [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2575.9199999999996s)]
*  deportation of 1.2 million people of Mexican background, including but not limited to American [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2585.2s)]
*  citizens of Mexican descent for the record. Okay. And in that process, Texas and many other places [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2592.8799999999997s)]
*  that relied on Mexican labor, farm hands and the like were actually openly defending [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2600.88s)]
*  through violent means against the federal government, their fellow laborers, things will [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2607.6800000000003s)]
*  change very quickly. When you start recognizing that this is going to genuinely destroy American [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2613.2000000000003s)]
*  agricultural production. Did Assange say a slur? What? No, I didn't. I purposely didn't say the name [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2621.36s)]
*  of the operation. Bros are horny for clips. Yeah. So excited. He's like, Ooh, maybe I can get him [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2628.88s)]
*  canceled. Now estimated 350,000 to 1 million deported up to 60% of Americans. I'm sure the [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2635.52s)]
*  real number is way higher than 1 million. Those agricultural production facilities took the risk [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2640.88s)]
*  of hiring illegal immigrants knowing that they may get deported for violating the law due to [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2654.48s)]
*  illegally immigrating here. The production may get slashed, but that is the result of cheap corporate [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2658.8s)]
*  greed. Yeah. The problem is there is no way to fill this role. You understand that, right? The real [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2663.04s)]
*  solution is not to the real solution is not to forcibly remove millions of people that are [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2671.04s)]
*  participating in the economy in very meaningful ways in much more meaningful ways than you. I'm [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2677.28s)]
*  loco. Okay. The solution is to document these people and allow them to participate in even [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2683.28s)]
*  more meaningful ways in the American economy and allow them to actually demand fairer wages. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2689.52s)]
*  For example, if the price of eggs are going to go up, if the price of avocado is going to go up, [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2694.88s)]
*  regardless, I would rather have it go up in a more ethical way, in a more sustainable way [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2699.92s)]
*  in the interim period than one that will completely destroy the American economy. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2707.04s)]
*  Okay. If you voted for Donald Trump personally, because you thought he was going to lower the [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2713.44s)]
*  egg prices, for example, you are in for a very hard, very shitty surprise when you realize that [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2719.84s)]
*  the price of eggs are going to shoot up to 20 fucking dollars when there's no one to, you know, [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2728.08s)]
*  work in the poultry facilities. The only difference is absolutely zero people are so racist [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2734.24s)]
*  that they will forego their treats. Okay. That's it. Everything that Donald Trump has ironically [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2739.9199999999996s)]
*  advocated for is actually inflationary, even though he was seen as the solution to the inflation [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2746.8799999999997s)]
*  crisis that Americans were experiencing. Wage growth did not outpace the cost of goods, the cost [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2754.24s)]
*  of goods going up. Tariffs on the other hand is inflationary. And so is mass deportation of 20 [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2763.12s)]
*  million migrants. Poultry and produce farms will become the new work camps to extract free labor [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2769.7599999999998s)]
*  of undocumented. Yes. Source for what? Anyway, those were the old days when they had tough [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2774.72s)]
*  policies to build a crowd of supporters. Think of that 1798. Oh, it's a powerful act. You couldn't [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2780.56s)]
*  pass something like that today. Let's continue. Fox news anchor, Pete Hegseth, his attorney [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2784.88s)]
*  confirms to NBC news Hegseth paid a settlement to a woman last year after she previously accused [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2790.24s)]
*  him of sexual assault in 2017. But the attorney says Hegseth maintains his innocence and that [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2795.52s)]
*  the encounter was consensual. Do you think that this matter could sink Pete Hegseth confirmation? [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2801.2799999999997s)]
*  It could. We'll figure out if he can get confirmed or not. And I do think that Pete's a good pick for [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2808.3999999999996s)]
*  this position. Mr. Trump has told advisors he plans to stand by Hegseth after a recent conversation [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2814.16s)]
*  with his nominee, according to the New York Times, citing two people briefed on the discussion, [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2819.68s)]
*  also facing new back. Like the most dude, the way I see this working, by the way, and there's a [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2824.3999999999996s)]
*  reason why, like the price or the stock prices of, of private prisons shot up after the Trump victory [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2830.72s)]
*  is the way I foresee this happening is private prison facilities are going to come back in a [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2838.64s)]
*  fucking massive way. Okay. They are going to build new private prison facilities, work camps, [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2842.8s)]
*  basically. And all of the, all of the migrants that they put into these work camps are going to [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2853.36s)]
*  have to work for free at gunpoint to, you know, to engage in this agricultural production that they [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2859.92s)]
*  were already doing for pennies on the dollar. But this time they'll have to do it for free. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2870.32s)]
*  This is my speculation. Okay. My suspicion is we already have slavery in this country. It is [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2875.1200000000003s)]
*  constitutionally protected as a form of punishment and we will utilize it. Slavery is illegal. No, [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2882.8s)]
*  it's not. Slavery is very much legal. Please. The 13th amendment that is supposed to abolish slavery [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2888.88s)]
*  actually still maintains slavery as a legal form of punishment. Okay. It is still [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2895.92s)]
*  absolutely fucking legally legal. It's legal in virtually every state. Okay. California as a [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2903.2000000000003s)]
*  matter of fact, just reconfirmed its legal status in a ballot measure. California voted to keep [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2909.36s)]
*  slavery as a legal form of punishment two fucking weeks ago. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2919.28s)]
*  For the record, before people say what, you know, what are you saying about agricultural [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2926.0s)]
*  workforce? Okay. What do you mean about agricultural workforce immigrants in American farms in 2019, [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2941.6800000000003s)]
*  more than half of all hired farm workers in the United States were immigrants or roughly [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2948.4s)]
*  450,000 workers in many states known for their fresh produce. Immigrant farm laborers make up [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2952.56s)]
*  large shares of miscellaneous agricultural workers in the state of California. 79.3% of [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2957.12s)]
*  agricultural workers are foreign born. They're either on a work like on a specific migrant worker [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2963.28s)]
*  visa, or they are undocumented workers. Okay. In Washington is 77% in Oregon and 73% in Florida. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2972.7200000000003s)]
*  It's 70.9% in Arizona. It's 69.8% in North Carolina. It's 64.3%. Okay. The share of [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2981.28s)]
*  miscellaneous agricultural workers and crop production that are undocumented as of 2019 [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2988.8s)]
*  is 30.9%. If you forcibly removed even 31% of the entire labor force in the agricultural sector, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=2993.28s)]
*  what do you think that would do to prices? What do you think that would do to supply? What do [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3003.28s)]
*  you think that would do to the supply of readily available agricultural goods? [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3008.64s)]
*  Yes, I know Cal matters. California rejected the ballot measure to California rejected the [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3016.72s)]
*  ballot measure to, to, I mean, they, this was horrible. Remove slavery exception. 53% of [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3023.92s)]
*  Californians voted to maintain slavery as a form of punishment. Now for the reason, for people who [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3030.7999999999997s)]
*  are saying, why the fuck did that happen? It is because number one, there was a big ass fucking [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3037.84s)]
*  campaign. Okay. Against removing it. And number two, it didn't have slavery in the, in the way [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3042.2400000000002s)]
*  that they wrote it. They wrote it as I think they wrote it as like servitude as a form of punishment. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3050.2400000000002s)]
*  That was the reason why a lot of people were confused. It was written as indentured servitude [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3057.44s)]
*  or involuntary servitude, not indentured servitude. Sorry. In, in other States where they openly write [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3063.6s)]
*  it as slavery, these ballot measures actually pass. They abolish slavery, but when you write it as [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3068.88s)]
*  involuntary servitude, people don't fully understand what that means, especially when there [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3077.2799999999997s)]
*  are active. Yeah. Tennessee wrote it specifically as slavery and it was banned by 80% of the vote. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3082.08s)]
*  Tennessee voters officially banned all forms of slavery in the state. Tennessee is officially [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3087.2s)]
*  banned all forms of slavery voters on Tuesday approved a ballot measures was back in 2022 [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3092.0s)]
*  that removes language of allowing slavery and involuntary servitude as forms of punishment for [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3096.88s)]
*  those convicted of crimes. The measure got 80% of the vote. Okay. Anyway, words matter. Okay. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3102.4s)]
*  The way people apply language in this situation and weaponize it matter. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3109.68s)]
*  Difficult path to confirmation. Gates resigned his seat last week, ending a house ethics committee [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3114.0s)]
*  investigation into whether he engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use allegations. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3118.96s)]
*  If you keep scrolling, it shows the number of Americans that kept doing agricultural jobs. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3124.08s)]
*  0.01%. What do you mean? Since he denies while some in both parties want the committee to release [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3127.6s)]
*  its report, house speaker Mike Johnson disagrees saying Gates is now a private citizen. I think [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3132.7200000000003s)]
*  that would be a Pandora's box. Hallie, let's go back to this news that just broke overnight. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3138.32s)]
*  President elect Trump confirming that he wants to declare a national emergency and then that [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3142.64s)]
*  would enable him to use the military. How might that work? How much would it cost? [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3147.44s)]
*  Let me take the second part of your question. First of all, how much would it cost? The answer [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3152.64s)]
*  is a lot of money, but we can't get super specific because it's not clear how much there's one [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3155.92s)]
*  estimate that suggests it could be something like $90 billion a year. That's from an immigration [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3160.88s)]
*  rights group, which also questions the impact to the economy more broadly saying that the annual [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3165.44s)]
*  GDP could take a hit because of the removal of workers, especially in the construction [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3169.68s)]
*  and hospitality industries. But president elect Trump and his allies have argued this issue is so [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3173.84s)]
*  important. It was so central to his campaign that it goes beyond costs. Mr. Trump remember told NBC [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3178.0s)]
*  news right after the election that there's no price tag on this because there's no choice other [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3183.1200000000003s)]
*  than to do it. He would need Congress to approve the money he needs. But remember both the house [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3187.5200000000004s)]
*  and the Senate will be in Republican control next year. As for the practicalities, how does [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3191.76s)]
*  this actually work? Again, real question marks there. Mr. Trump was pressed repeatedly during [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3195.84s)]
*  his campaign for answers on the specifics, but that's still not clear. We are of course out to [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3200.4s)]
*  the Trump transition for any more details on the plan, Savannah. All right. Howie Jackson leading [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3204.96s)]
*  us off from Washington. Thank you. Hey, thanks for watching. Don't miss the today show every weekday [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3209.04s)]
*  at 11am Eastern, eight Pacific on our streaming channel today, all day to watch head to today. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3214.56s)]
*  All right. You need a conversation between Elon Musk and Trump advisor Axios reports, but before [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3220.56s)]
*  we get to that, before we get to the drama, okay. What have you seen this yet? I did the AOC thing. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3225.52s)]
*  I did. It was really funny. They're calling her an anti-Semite. Okay. No price tag. Has any Democrat [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3231.84s)]
*  ever said anything like that ever? Why is this that why is this what is essential, but not healthcare? [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3238.64s)]
*  What is wrong with the Democrats? I hate it. Yeah. So before we move on to the internal drama here, [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3243.44s)]
*  okay. I do want to show you. And before we talk about like the Amsterdam mayor saying that oopsie, [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3249.28s)]
*  maybe it wasn't a pogrom that occurred in Amsterdam and that I was right because you know, [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3256.0s)]
*  I was just looking at the actual facts and not hysterically screeching. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3262.96s)]
*  So before we get to all of that, let's talk about something different. Let's go back to my favorite [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3271.12s)]
*  MSNBC morning show. Now, if you have an assortment of clips from Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough, [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3278.64s)]
*  I would love to see them because if I recall correctly, not that long ago, as recently as like [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3288.48s)]
*  last week or a week prior, Joe and Mika were calling Donald Trump, Hitlerian, Adolf Hitler. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3296.24s)]
*  Now they have a very different attitude about Donald Trump. If you want the full video, [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3302.3199999999997s)]
*  it's on the playlist. No, before the full video, I want, I want Joe Scarborough and Donald Joe [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3307.68s)]
*  Scarborough talking about Donald Trump and resisting Donald Trump. Let's find, let's find a clip. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3313.68s)]
*  Let's see if I can find one real quick. Mr. Schmidt, this is your extraordinary. No, this is, [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3319.9199999999996s)]
*  this isn't Joe Scarborough. Hold on. Cause Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski had openly, [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3326.64s)]
*  openly stated time and time again. One show that's more response. That's okay. I don't want to, [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3334.96s)]
*  I want the, I want clips. I want the clips. I want the clips. Does anyone have clips? Can you find me [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3340.96s)]
*  some clips of Joe Scarborough talking about Trump being Adolf Hitler? Cause I know that it exists [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3346.32s)]
*  cause I remember watching it. Okay. Oh here. Perfect. People in the media have a responsibility [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3353.36s)]
*  really to tune out the voices of, of the haters, of, of the people that are constantly a double, [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3360.2400000000002s)]
*  triple checking and shilling for him and suggesting that somehow they're being biased, [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3366.5600000000004s)]
*  bending over backwards, treating him like a normal candidate. He's not a normal candidate. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3371.6800000000003s)]
*  He is running to end American democracy as we know it. He's an authoritarian who a court [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3376.8s)]
*  in Colorado two days ago ruled that, that he led an insurrection against the United States government. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3383.6s)]
*  He's charged with leading schemes to help overthrow the United States government. So, [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3391.04s)]
*  so if they want to frame it that way, that's fine. If you want to be fair, [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3397.04s)]
*  you want to be fair, then you will frame this as Joe Biden being the candidate that supports [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3401.92s)]
*  American democracy and Donald Trump, a candidate who supports a new form of government here. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3408.4s)]
*  This authoritarian it's really that simple. And by the way, Reverend Allen, people go, Oh, [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3414.32s)]
*  you can't compare it to the past. You can't compare him to this past Nazi leader or that [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3419.44s)]
*  past fascist leader because he hasn't done that. Well, what hasn't he done? He hasn't done the [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3425.12s)]
*  things that the American judicial system did not allow him to do last time, but may very well [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3432.64s)]
*  allow him to do this time or a judicial system that will be ignored by Donald Trump and ran over [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3441.2799999999997s)]
*  by Donald Trump, this constitutional crisis of our lifetime, just because he hasn't done it yet, [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3448.3199999999997s)]
*  doesn't mean he won't do it when he gets a chance to do it. And if he is voted into office, [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3455.04s)]
*  then a lot of these people that are talking about literal or figurative or whatever the [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3462.64s)]
*  hell they're saying, you're going to look like idiots because he will do, he will get away with, [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3466.7999999999997s)]
*  he will imprison, he will execute whoever he's allowed to imprison, execute, [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3475.2s)]
*  drive from the country. Just look at his past. It's not really hard to read. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3485.52s)]
*  Again, the only thing that stood between him and the destruction of American democracy [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3491.92s)]
*  was the federal judiciary. No doubt about it. And I think. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3498.24s)]
*  Damn, man. These guys are popping. I mean, they're popping off. They're popping off. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3502.08s)]
*  They're so right. They're so right about this. Okay. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3507.52s)]
*  He's constantly trying to distract. He's constantly trying to change the subject. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3511.68s)]
*  He wants to talk about anything that will stop him from talking about policy because he doesn't [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3516.96s)]
*  know policy. He's never known policy. He never will know policy. It's just like, damn, they're [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3522.0s)]
*  really popping off on this stuff. Let me see. Let, I mean, hold on. I want to see, I want to see more [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3528.96s)]
*  from Joe talking about, you know, before Donald Trump becomes president, let's see what else he [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3534.64s)]
*  had to say one in 2016. And that was because of white voters. And I think part of this race-based [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3540.08s)]
*  fear rhetoric is that on some instinctive level informed by the top lines of polling is that he [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3546.16s)]
*  thinks white people aren't scared enough in these places in the upper Midwest. And so you talk about [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3551.68s)]
*  Haitians taking over Springfield. And in a lot of these speeches he gave over the weekend, [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3558.16s)]
*  they were in those states where he's trying to scare the crap out of white voters to try to [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3561.92s)]
*  get them back because he can't believe that Kamala Harris is doing as well with them as she is. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3566.3999999999996s)]
*  And again, saying they're going to come to your kitchen or your house and slit your throat. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3570.64s)]
*  That's where he's got, can you imagine? First of all, it's hard to project this onto any other [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3577.3599999999997s)]
*  country because of the unique place and the unique role that the United States plays in global affairs. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3585.12s)]
*  But could you imagine us following a campaign in the UK, in France, in any major industrialized [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3592.48s)]
*  country where somebody who is tied is running around talking about the eating of dogs and cats, [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3601.6800000000003s)]
*  talking about people coming to your houses and slitting your throats, talking about a day of [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3610.08s)]
*  celebrating a day of violence, talking about being a dictator for a day talk. I mean, we could go [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3617.12s)]
*  down the list. It really is. I think because wow, these guys are, these guys are really popping [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3623.6800000000003s)]
*  off about Donald Trump and the very real and immediate danger that Donald Trump presents to [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3630.64s)]
*  the future of America. Donald Trump is hailing a modern version of American fascism and actively [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3635.76s)]
*  talking about how Donald Trump is doing that. Here's Joe calling him a danger to democracy [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3643.8399999999997s)]
*  and a liar. Do you not call it a threat to democracy when Donald Trump says [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3648.0s)]
*  that he wants to execute the chairman of the joint chief for treason? It's not not a threat [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3652.72s)]
*  saying that your vice president deserves lynching saying that to your legal counsel. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3658.16s)]
*  So why am I showing all of this? Well, lo and behold, now that Donald Trump is president, [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3663.7599999999998s)]
*  Joe Scarborough on his morning show spent basically every waking moment blaming the libs. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3670.8s)]
*  Okay. Blaming the progressives, talking about trans people, talking about how woke was the [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3677.76s)]
*  reason why Donald Trump became president. And then this morning, as of today, it turns out, [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3683.44s)]
*  you know, Joe Scarborough went from saying Donald Trump is Hitler to highly Hitler personally, [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3690.2400000000002s)]
*  literally. They went from calling Donald Trump Hitler to highly Hitler in less than a week. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3696.88s)]
*  These people are progressives who advocate for free college and free health care more than people [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3702.4s)]
*  who want to do mass deportations. They've only been complaining about the leftist. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3705.6800000000003s)]
*  Over the past long, behold, Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, two people that were [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3709.84s)]
*  directly connected to Donald Trump in very meaningful ways for years and years and years [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3716.1600000000003s)]
*  have rekindled that relationship once again, rekindled that relationship. Once again, [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3721.92s)]
*  it turns out they don't mind how much of a fucking fascist Donald Trump is. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3728.0s)]
*  And it's going to come as no surprise to anybody who watches this show has watched it over the [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3781.92s)]
*  past year or over the past decade that we didn't see eye to eye on a lot of issues. And we told [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3788.16s)]
*  him so what we did agree on was to restart communications. My father often spoke with [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3794.7200000000003s)]
*  world leaders with whom he and the United States profoundly disagreed. Her father, [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3801.36s)]
*  uh, which I can't say his name. It's impossible. Zbigniew Brzezinski. Okay. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3809.04s)]
*  Famously also talked about big Z himself famously also talked about how wonderful it was that they [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3817.2s)]
*  had radicalized the Moja Hadid in Afghanistan, giving the USSR its own version of Vietnam. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3826.24s)]
*  When directly asked the question about the threat of Islamist fundamentalism that the [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3836.1600000000003s)]
*  American government had actively, actively spearheaded. Okay. He said, what's more [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3841.92s)]
*  dangerous? We were able to, we were able to bring the USSR to heel by activating these radical [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3848.88s)]
*  groups inside of Afghanistan, forcing them to do their own version of Vietnam that ended up [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3858.5600000000004s)]
*  destroying the USSR. A couple radical Islamist fundamentalists with arms is not that big of a [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3864.48s)]
*  threat. Now, of course, he said that before 9 11 famously after 9 11, he, you know, I wonder what [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3873.84s)]
*  his opinion was. I think he ran away from that interview. Okay. But that's neither here nor [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3882.08s)]
*  there. I'm big Z is just one of many different villains that has worked in the American [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3886.88s)]
*  administration, but you know, he's dead now and it doesn't really matter. So let's get back to, [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3894.3199999999997s)]
*  let's get back to the matter at hand. Mika and Joe, I showed you guys all of the times when they [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3901.52s)]
*  were like, this guy's Hitler, this guy's Hitler, this guy's Hitler. And now they're saying they're [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3908.72s)]
*  having a cordial relationship that they have restarted with Adolf Hitler. So the question [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3912.72s)]
*  remains, were they lying? When they said Donald Trump is Adolf Hitler. If you're a right-winger, [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3917.04s)]
*  you're going to point to this and say, of course they were lying. See, there it is. These guys [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3922.4s)]
*  don't believe anything that they're saying. And the right-wingers are to a certain degree, correct [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3927.44s)]
*  that they don't necessarily believe that Donald Trump is Adolf Hitler. They are correct on that. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3933.44s)]
*  However, as someone looking at this from the outside, I do believe that Donald Trump is a [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3938.96s)]
*  fascist. I just simply think they don't care. I think they do not care that Donald Trump is a [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3944.48s)]
*  fascist because they want to keep their cushy media jobs. They want to keep their waning influence. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3951.6s)]
*  And as ratings fall apart in a disastrous fashion for the likes of MSNBC and CNN, these brown nosers [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3961.44s)]
*  are trying to desperately cling on to any crumb of relevance they can. If they didn't care, why would [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3973.12s)]
*  they keep bringing alarm bells about it constantly before though? Great question. But if they do care, [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3980.24s)]
*  why are they now capitulating? That's it. It's because liberals are showing their bellies. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3985.68s)]
*  Understand, this is why I said, looking at exactly what German liberalism looked like [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=3994.0s)]
*  in the buildup to Nazi Germany, German business owners, German capitalists, and their [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4002.24s)]
*  participation within the rise of Nazi Germany, as this rise of power, liberals actively collaborated [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4010.3999999999996s)]
*  with the Nazi movement against communist trade unionists and socialists alike. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4019.3599999999997s)]
*  And history is unfolding once again. It's repeating itself once again. These are the liberals that have [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4026.72s)]
*  now decided that they would rather collaborate and collude with the fascist resurgence in this [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4033.68s)]
*  country than to actively resist it. This is why I also said things will be different this time around. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4044.72s)]
*  When many people were talking about resistance liberalism and what that's going to look like, [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4052.7999999999997s)]
*  is it going to look exactly like 2016 when everyone immediately actively [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4057.2799999999997s)]
*  started talking about how they were going to resist against the Trump administration the [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4061.52s)]
*  first time around? I told you that it's not going to happen. Donald Trump has been president for [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4065.28s)]
*  four years already. These people are just going to treat him like any other Republican president. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4069.6800000000003s)]
*  And in some respects, he is just like any other Republican president. And in many cases, he's not. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4076.5600000000004s)]
*  He's a logical conclusion to right-wing reactionary attitudes, sentiments, and anger. Okay. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4082.48s)]
*  And the resistance never Trump Republicans, the resistance liberals are not going to be as active [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4090.4s)]
*  as they were in the media. They are going to look to find common ground with Adolf Hitler. They are [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4096.88s)]
*  going to look to find common ground with Adolf Hitler and purge Adolf Hitler's. Okay. Understand [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4103.92s)]
*  that that is where we are at. Okay. I'm not going to watch a 30 minute podcast from three arrows [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4112.0s)]
*  about America's coming Weimar moment, because unfortunately it's not great to watch on stream, [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4118.56s)]
*  even though this is a fantastic piece. I like three arrows quite a bit. As you guys know, [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4123.84s)]
*  we've collaborated many times in the past. I do not believe I think what is happening right now [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4128.64s)]
*  in liberal media is not an immediate, not an immediate resistance against like what Trump [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4141.04s)]
*  presents, but a normalization of Donald Trump. I think you will see this more and more. You will [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4148.08s)]
*  see more and more people normalizing Donald Trump and maybe even claiming, well, he's the president. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4155.28s)]
*  We have to work with him. We have to work with what we have. Okay. And not only will they not [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4161.2s)]
*  resist in the ways that they tried to last time around, I think they're going to normalize it and [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4166.8s)]
*  look for an out group, look for a common enemy. And for a lot of these people who are already [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4173.12s)]
*  former Republicans themselves, like Joe Scarborough literally is a Republican, the common enemy will [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4180.320000000001s)]
*  be marginalized people, defenseless people, trans people, undocumented immigrants, and the left as [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4185.2s)]
*  a whole. Okay. This is exactly what happened in Nazi Germany to a fucking T. This is exactly what [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4191.2s)]
*  happened. I would like to watch, not the three arrows one, but there is, I'm sure there is another [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4200.32s)]
*  YouTuber like, fuck there's, I'm sure there's another YouTube essay that we go watch with that [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4209.12s)]
*  has like more, you know, visual, visually stimulating stuff. And here, here is the MRC [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4214.4s)]
*  media bus. Is the time to sound the alarm? When is the time to start saying, well, does this look [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4224.879999999999s)]
*  like Germany in 1932? This is not a reach. I could go back and talk about Nazi Germany and I do it, [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4231.2s)]
*  I do it without any concerns whatsoever. And if people can't start drawing the parallels, [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4237.36s)]
*  well, you're just stupid or you have your head in the sand. We still have an electorate, 70 million [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4242.0s)]
*  plus that will be voting for a man who said he was going to assassinate for treason. The chairman of [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4249.04s)]
*  the joint chiefs, cause he didn't support him on January the sixth, who said just in recent days, [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4254.24s)]
*  he was going to execute Liz Cheney with a firing squad, nine guns pointed and shooting at her face. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4258.88s)]
*  A man who has said that he was going to shut down CBS cause he didn't like how they edited an [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4264.8s)]
*  interview. A man who said he was going to be a dictator from day one. On Friday, we were given [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4269.2s)]
*  the opportunity to do just that. Joe and I went to Mar-a-Lago to meet personally with president-elect [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4275.44s)]
*  Trump. It was the first time we have seen him in seven years. The rule. Now we talked about a lot [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4283.36s)]
*  of issues, including abortion, mass deportation, threats of political retribution against political [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4290.88s)]
*  opponents and media outlets. We talked about that a good bit and it's going to come as no surprise [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4296.4s)]
*  to anybody who watches this show has watched it over the past year or over the past decade [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4302.719999999999s)]
*  that we didn't see eye to eye on a lot of issues. And we told him so. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4309.44s)]
*  Donald Trump is Adolf Hitler, but here's why we're hanging out with Adolf Hitler. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4313.92s)]
*  This is the one hour long, but it's amazing. The German revolution of 1918, how it all began. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4319.2s)]
*  Yeah. I think like the, the part that I am specifically talking about is the active, [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4324.8s)]
*  is the active collaboration amongst liberals with Nazi Germany. And I want to draw comparisons to [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4331.44s)]
*  what's going on currently. Okay. That's what I'm looking for. And I know that there's YouTube [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4337.76s)]
*  essays on it. I've watched YouTube essays on it before, because there is a lot of historically [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4342.48s)]
*  muddying the waters in the way that people present the buildup to the, I mean, the buildup [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4350.56s)]
*  to Nazi Germany and the, and the momentum from Nazis and how people resisted the, the growth of [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4356.56s)]
*  the Nazi movement and the prominence it found itself in. And I think that, you know, I think [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4362.64s)]
*  that a lot of people don't realize, a lot of people don't realize the role that liberals played in [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4368.320000000001s)]
*  maintaining the current order, the current hierarchy and maintaining capitalism. Okay. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4375.84s)]
*  To be honest, I don't see your point. You keep showing a clip of them saying they talk to him. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4382.4800000000005s)]
*  So what are people not allowed to talk to him? If you say Donald Trump is Adolf Hitler, [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4385.76s)]
*  then you're basically saying you're talking to Adolf Hitler and you're reigniting your [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4391.2s)]
*  relationship with Adolf Hitler. You're not supposed to do that. Okay. What a ridiculous fucking take. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4395.76s)]
*  You either are openly demonstrating that you don't care that he's Adolf Hitler, [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4401.84s)]
*  or you're saying that you were lying about him being Adolf Hitler this whole time. Republicans [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4406.0s)]
*  will look at this and go, they were lying about Trump being Adolf Hitler. I look at this and go, [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4410.88s)]
*  they do not care that Donald Trump is a fascist. That's a task shared by reporters and commentators [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4416.08s)]
*  alike. We had not spoken to president Trump since March of 2020, other than a personal call, [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4421.92s)]
*  Joe made to Trump on the morning after the attempt on his life in Butler, Pennsylvania. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4430.080000000001s)]
*  In this meeting, president Trump was tearful. He was upbeat. He seemed interested in finding common [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4434.96s)]
*  ground with Democrats on some of the most divisive issues. And for those asking why we would go speak [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4442.080000000001s)]
*  to the president-elect during such fraught times, especially between us, I guess I would ask back, [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4448.8s)]
*  why wouldn't we? Five years of political warfare has deeply divided Washington and the country. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4456.0s)]
*  We have been as clear as we know how in expressing our deep concerns about president Trump's actions [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4462.16s)]
*  and words in the coarsening of public debate. But for nearly 80 million Americans, election [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4469.04s)]
*  denialism, public trials in January 6th were not as important as those are not the worst parts of [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4476.56s)]
*  Donald Trump's potential second coming. The worst parts of Donald Trump's second coming is not January [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4483.68s)]
*  6th. Okay. It's mass deportations, you fucking idiots. And it's very obvious that this is the [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4490.96s)]
*  reason why the Democrats never found a successful narrative that penetrated public consciousness on [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4498.72s)]
*  the dangers that Donald Trump represents, because they like all the bad shit that he wants to do. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4504.88s)]
*  They like all the shit that he is truly hit Larian over. Okay. They agree with it. That's [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4510.88s)]
*  the problem. They don't have a problem with mass deportations. Okay. What is this? Do people like [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4517.2s)]
*  Mehdi Hassan know that billionaire donors are actually pulling the Democratic party to the [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4523.84s)]
*  left? The average Democratic voter is conservatively to the right than the average Democratic donor, [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4526.88s)]
*  whether small donor or large. I have no real opinion here and it wouldn't mean anything anyway, [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4529.84s)]
*  but the people in the in-groups find me extremely annoying and the feeling is mutual, but this is a [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4534.0s)]
*  dynamic that's seen in basically every party. It's good. We're reckoning with them now, but it's not [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4537.44s)]
*  why hair is laws. And for what is worth the average billionaire Democratic donors considerably to the [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4541.12s)]
*  left of the average Democratic voter, as well as it, when it comes to social issues, wow, [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4545.44s)]
*  it's got a lot of traction. I have nothing to say beyond the fact that this has been studied quite [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4548.639999999999s)]
*  extensively in each case. Top donors are less centrist. This is not an issue. Donors are [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4551.2s)]
*  generally more educated, engaged and partisan. Even when looking at billionaires, you can easily [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4555.04s)]
*  see the stance of Dustin Moskowitz, Tom Steyer, et cetera, to see that the study's findings hold [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4559.04s)]
*  quite a bit of merit here too. Yeah, dude, the top billionaire donors in the Democratic party [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4563.44s)]
*  actually personally want Medicare for all. Yeah, that's what they're doing. Yeah. They want, [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4568.16s)]
*  they want to destroy billionaires. That's what they want to do. The top liberal donors are [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4574.0s)]
*  significantly more progressive is ultimately a fucking meaning meaningless term at that point. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4579.28s)]
*  Okay. It is straightforwardly a meaningless fucking term at that point. What are they [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4584.879999999999s)]
*  progressive on? Are they progressive on things that actually the overwhelming majority of [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4589.44s)]
*  Americans would benefit from? Fuck no. The argument is the people want left economic populism. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4593.5199999999995s)]
*  Okay. And the Democratic party doesn't afford, doesn't, doesn't actually offer that. Okay. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4599.44s)]
*  They said social, not economic law. Exactly. For those curious, this is how it looks like in the [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4605.679999999999s)]
*  research paper. When you limit the top 1% donors only the same findings hold. Yeah. The methodology [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4610.639999999999s)]
*  of this is what's important. The top 1% of donors, how many are billionaire donors? The phrase [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4615.36s)]
*  you use in the original tweet that I think set everyone off. So the top 1% of donors is more [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4619.28s)]
*  multimillionaires than it is billionaires. However, when you take a look at open seekers [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4623.04s)]
*  and scroll through the top donor list, you can literally just compare Steyer, Mousekowitz, [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4626.08s)]
*  et cetera, to the average Dem voter to see how it generalizes. Even those guys are on the whole, [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4628.8s)]
*  far more partisan, more free trade and anti-tariff and more committed to things like gun control [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4634.32s)]
*  and abortion than the average voter is Cuban and Hoffman get blowback, but they're to the left of [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4638.16s)]
*  the average voter in line with them. Partisans. I don't think the study failing captures the influence [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4642.16s)]
*  these donors have, how they exerted in the party and how it really relates to personal ideologies. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4645.92s)]
*  But the idea that they are more committed to Dems core issues than the marginal [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4650.56s)]
*  average voter makes sense. The problem is what the Dems are committed to in terms of their [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4654.0s)]
*  core issues. That is the problem here. The problem is the democratic party presents [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4658.4800000000005s)]
*  aesthetic progress by simply saying we are, you know, pro abortion. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYyxv24sYs&t=4664.08s)]
