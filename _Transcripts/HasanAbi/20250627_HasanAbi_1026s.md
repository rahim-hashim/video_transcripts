**HasanAbi:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw)
*  And without us everything blows up, you know, we sort of control the world in that sense, but we have a guy [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=0.0s)]
*  That's just a stubborn mule [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=6.38s)]
*  And a stupid person is making a big mistake [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=8.540000000000001s)]
*  Years because when you do the debt now I've instructed my people not to burn mule beyond [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=13.96s)]
*  Stupid person so get this guy out [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=19.8s)]
*  And [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=22.34s)]
*  I've gotten along with him really great, so we'll see what happens, but somebody saying flint [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=27.54s)]
*  I think we'll work it out if there is it wouldn't involve us [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=35.58s)]
*  But again, we're very far away from a lot of these places that we're solving problems with [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=39.260000000000005s)]
*  But I enjoy doing it. I like doing it and it's the right thing to do and we're able we have an ability to get it [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=44.3s)]
*  done so we're solving things and [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=49.54s)]
*  We didn't have a lot to do with Serbia Kosovo. I told you we solved a potential disaster [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=52.34s)]
*  I can tell you that [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=59.1s)]
*  Some of the countries that you're not going to hear about but some countries that were ready to go to war with their neighbor [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=61.940000000000005s)]
*  Are not going to go to war with their neighbor, and it's that's a great thing [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=66.94s)]
*  We have a number of them, but I just I'm very happy about [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=71.86s)]
*  India and Pakistan because they have they actually have nuclear weapons [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=75.66s)]
*  You know when you talk about Iran they were trying to get it but [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=79.54s)]
*  India has nuclear weapons Pakistan has nuclear weapons high-level [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=83.74s)]
*  nuclear weapons both and [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=89.34s)]
*  Getting that solved was was really great. We did it through trade. So it was a great thing [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=91.82s)]
*  Are you concerned that the Iranians may have some enriched uranium at pickaxe mountain [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=100.7s)]
*  The last thing they're thinking about right now is enriched uranium [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=106.94s)]
*  They're not thinking about what they want to do is they want to get back to life and they do want to meet me [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=111.42s)]
*  And we'll do that quickly. I'm going to do it quickly [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=115.78s)]
*  They may say that to you don't you think they want to meet me don't you think we have sanctions on there that they can't [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=124.22s)]
*  Do anything wouldn't you think that they want to meet me? I mean [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=129.57999999999998s)]
*  They're not stupid people, but they went through a lot [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=133.72s)]
*  And they suffered and so did Israel Israel suffered greatly. It was a nasty 12 days and [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=138.12s)]
*  Yeah, we'll see what happens [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=146.12s)]
*  Considering sending patriot missiles to Ukraine. Have you made up your mind about that yet? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=149.64000000000001s)]
*  There are a few unanswered questions that remain in this field for example will [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=156.52s)]
*  The Rwandan troops pull back from [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=163.08s)]
*  23 rebel group be allowed to remain in parts of the eastern DR [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=168.36s)]
*  Well, let me ask you that question you want to answer that one it sounds like an interesting question for you go ahead [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=174.16000000000003s)]
*  Thank you very much in the agreement. We signed [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  we have [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=183.16000000000003s)]
*  taken the concept of operation for the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=184.92000000000002s)]
*  Neutralization of the FDL are which is a vicious genocidal movement and the lifting of random defensive measures [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=187.88s)]
*  So this was already signed last year in November, so we will implement it this [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=194.56s)]
*  Concept of operation to do both things to neutralize this movement [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=201.20000000000002s)]
*  Which has been disabilizing Rwanda for many years and to lift our defensive measures as for the m23 in the agreement also we have [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=205.28s)]
*  Decided to rely on the doha talks because they are currently talks between the a FCM 23 and the DRC government [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=214.5s)]
*  To have a peace deal also that will complement the Washington peace agreement. So the both things are taken care of [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=222.02s)]
*  Working with them to get it enforced they can enforce their own agreement [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=233.14s)]
*  But we'll be putting a lot of pressure on to make sure it gets enforced the two people in this room are very very capable people [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=236.58s)]
*  And they'll get it done. I think they'll get it done [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=242.66s)]
*  They they love the one thing I learned very quickly is how much you love your country and you want to get it done [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=245.1s)]
*  And they know it has to get done. Otherwise [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=251.18s)]
*  Bad things happen, but I think we're well beyond that other president should have done what I'm doing right now [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=253.62s)]
*  They never did it. I don't think they ever tried. I don't think it's like they couldn't do it [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=258.98s)]
*  I don't think they ever tried and if they did they wouldn't be able to do it anyway [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=262.4s)]
*  And [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=266.90000000000003s)]
*  Thank you, mr. President [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=269.06s)]
*  Can you share with us what can happen if one of the parts violate this peace agreement because we don't want war? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=270.46000000000004s)]
*  Oh, that's not a good question. I'd rather not say I would just say that there are big penalties if they violate and that's not a [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=278.90000000000003s)]
*  I don't like that question because this is I mean as far as I understand is still going right? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=285.86s)]
*  Even though there have been treaties in the past as well [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=291.7s)]
*  Like it hasn't it doesn't actually stop the fighting maybe maybe trouble I don't know who knows so Canada [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=295.5s)]
*  I put a charge on some of our companies and Canada has been a very difficult country to deal with over the years [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=301.58s)]
*  You know, we hear Canada. We have a great relationship with the people of Canada, but it's been very difficult and they put a [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=309.58s)]
*  Charge in they were a little bit earlier. We found out about it [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=315.74s)]
*  So and we have all the cards we have all every single one [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=318.5s)]
*  We don't want to do anything bad, but they have [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=322.22s)]
*  economically we have [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=326.02s)]
*  Such power over Canada. I'd rather not use it [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=327.7s)]
*  But they did something with our tech companies today trying to copy Europe, you know, they copied Europe [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=330.78000000000003s)]
*  It's not going to work out well for Europe either and it's not going to work out well for Canada [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=336.5s)]
*  They were foolish to do it. And so I said we're going to stop all negotiations with Canada right now until they [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=340.98s)]
*  Straighten out their act [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=347.94s)]
*  No, they put a tax on companies that were American companies that they shouldn't have very severe tax and [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=352.5s)]
*  Yeah, I guess they could remove it they will but it I don't really I mean it doesn't matter to me we have all the cards [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=360.94s)]
*  We have all the cards, you know, we do a lot of business with Canada, but relatively little they do most of their businesses with us [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=367.34000000000003s)]
*  And when you have that circumstance you treat people better [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=374.54s)]
*  they've had farmers that [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=378.7s)]
*  Are getting like 300 400 200 percent in tariffs. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. We have cases [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=381.18s)]
*  You don't read this and the people that report but they charge us 400 percent on some [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=388.14s)]
*  Dairy products 400 percent. Nobody writes that [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=395.21999999999997s)]
*  It's not fair to our farmers and we've got to protect our farmers [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=399.5s)]
*  Interest on the debt earlier today [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=410.7s)]
*  Well, I don't have a comment I'd love them to resign if they wanted to he's done lousy job look [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=423.58s)]
*  If you were there [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=429.26s)]
*  You'd say well, you know the United States is doing well [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=431.18s)]
*  They have no inflation and if they do get inflation in a year or two [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=434.97999999999996s)]
*  We'll put we'll start raising the rest we'll get rid of the inflation, you know do other things [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=438.94s)]
*  Biden had the worst inflation in the history of our country [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=444.9s)]
*  Not much higher than that [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=448.41999999999996s)]
*  Frankly, they say 19 percent. They say I think it's a lot higher than that and we have almost no inflation now [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=450.41999999999996s)]
*  We've done a great job in a short period of time [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=456.26s)]
*  Energy prices are way down gasoline now is down to close to two dollars in a lot of places a couple of places [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=459.14000000000004s)]
*  I see it even broke. It's like 198 a gallon [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=465.62s)]
*  We've done a great job on inflation and honestly pretty much everything else. I [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=469.14000000000004s)]
*  think that I [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=474.54s)]
*  think it's [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=476.62s)]
*  very sad the way people act, you know, you have a [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=478.1s)]
*  Guy in there that with the stroke of a pen could lower interest rates and save us hundreds of billions of dollars a year [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=481.58s)]
*  But he's a stupid person, you know, it's very interesting. He I [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=489.58s)]
*  I'm not sure if he doesn't understand it [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=495.58s)]
*  Because you should be able to understand it. It's sort of one-on-one economics, but I'm not sure that but think of it [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=498.58s)]
*  With the stroke of a pen [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=505.42s)]
*  Economics you just lie you make up numbers is one-on-one economics money is fake who cares these are nice numbers for you, right? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=508.06s)]
*  900 billion 950 billion dollars by lowering interest rates and it's really just more of a paper movement [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=516.0600000000001s)]
*  It's not like I say gas is a dollar a gallon in Indiana and it doesn't have to be true [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=521.94s)]
*  You won't check it. No one checks it even people in Indiana. Believe me when I say it. It's beautiful. It's great [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=528.4200000000001s)]
*  101 economics rate than the United States of America and without us everything blows up, you know [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=535.9399999999999s)]
*  We sort of control the world in that sense, but we have a guy that's just a stubborn mule [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=542.24s)]
*  And a stupid person [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=548.3s)]
*  Making a big mistake [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=550.86s)]
*  For years because when you do the debt now, I've instructed my people not to do a [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=553.38s)]
*  Mule beyond stupid or so get this guy out and [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=558.06s)]
*  Whoever is in there will lower rates if I don't if I think somebody's gonna keep the rates where they are [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=562.98s)]
*  Why hasn't he done it? I'm not gonna put him in I'm gonna put somebody that wants to cut rates [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=569.02s)]
*  There are a lot of them out there and I said this morning a lot of the business shows today was saying, you know [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=573.18s)]
*  Trump is right. He should be cutting rights. Think of it. We have a great country. We're making a lot of money [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=578.1s)]
*  We're taking in billions of dollars in tariffs. We have one we have [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=583.36s)]
*  15 trillion dollars of money that wants to be invested here, which is a record in two months [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=587.0799999999999s)]
*  It breaks any record that we've ever had for a whole year [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=593.18s)]
*  And not even close 15 trillion and it's going to be much higher than that [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=597.4799999999999s)]
*  That's after essentially two months because you know, we've been doing it for about two months two and a half months [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=601.76s)]
*  15 trillion dollars breaks every record in the book [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=607.88s)]
*  There's never been anything like this. We have factories moving in we have car plants moving in [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=611.16s)]
*  We have everyone wants to be part of the United States and as I told you and I say to everybody when I was in the Middle East [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=615.5600000000001s)]
*  the King of Saudi Arabia and Qatar [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=621.9200000000001s)]
*  UAE all great leaders [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=625.22s)]
*  They have all great leaders all three of them said you got the hottest country in the world and you did it in at that [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=626.82s)]
*  Time I was there for four months because we got back a little while ago [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=632.6400000000001s)]
*  But everybody says it not only them we have the hottest country in the world right now [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=636.24s)]
*  the only thing is we have a Fed Chairman that is [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=641.1600000000001s)]
*  He doesn't get it and you could have [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=644.68s)]
*  Substantially low like if we cut him two points would save more than 600 think of it more than 600 billion dollars [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=648.3199999999999s)]
*  Just because you cut but you can't go out to the market and say well [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=654.52s)]
*  We have a guy that's got us at 4% or 4 and a half percent and we want to pay 2% or 1% [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=658.16s)]
*  I think we should be paying 1% right now and [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=662.76s)]
*  We're paying more because we have a guy who's you know suffers from I think Trump's arrangement syndrome if you want to know that [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=667.3199999999999s)]
*  But he's not good for our country [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=673.8399999999999s)]
*  Mr. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=676.2800000000001s)]
*  Well, I think the D bankers [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=703.12s)]
*  I think that banks, I can tell you because I've been a victim myself because of my politics, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=704.96s)]
*  that big banks were us. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=710.48s)]
*  And I actually think it was Biden's people that told him to be because the one group [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=714.2800000000001s)]
*  of people the banks are afraid of are the regulators. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=719.72s)]
*  They are petrified of the regulators. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=722.2s)]
*  And I've seen the biggest banker. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=724.38s)]
*  I can tell you, you see him on television all the time. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=726.72s)]
*  If a regulator walked into the room, he gets all nervous and crazy. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=729.12s)]
*  They're afraid of the regulators. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=734.32s)]
*  And if the Biden people order the banks to be virtually closed, they can do anything [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=735.64s)]
*  they want. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=741.0s)]
*  The regulators control the banks. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=741.28s)]
*  It's not the president of the bank. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=742.92s)]
*  The president of the bank is far less important to a bank than a regulator. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=744.72s)]
*  And a regulator can put that bank out of business, just like bad prosecutors are very [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=748.84s)]
*  dangerous. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=753.88s)]
*  You know, we had a couple. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=754.48s)]
*  I had deranged Jack Smith and some others and we kicked their ass. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=755.36s)]
*  But it was, you know, it's a tough kind of a situation. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=760.04s)]
*  Prosecutors are very dangerous. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=763.12s)]
*  A great prosecutor is an amazing asset for a country, but a corrupt prosecutor, a bad [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=765.04s)]
*  prosecutor is very bad. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=770.92s)]
*  Well, the regulators are the same thing. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=772.0s)]
*  And when they tell the regulator to go and make it make life impossible for big banks [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=774.24s)]
*  or little banks, they really control it. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=778.72s)]
*  So there is a lot of debanking and there's a call it the bank and call a lot of different [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=781.28s)]
*  names. Essentially, they make it impossible to do business. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=785.8s)]
*  And those people are very bad and very dangerous and they shouldn't be doing it. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=789.2s)]
*  Taxes, Mr. President, could you please explain how taxes would go up by 68 percent if the [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=796.2s)]
*  bill isn't passed? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=802.0400000000001s)]
*  Where does that number come from? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=802.8000000000001s)]
*  Well, it comes from the fact that you have automatically the Trump cuts, which were the [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=803.9200000000001s)]
*  biggest cuts that we've ever had. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=808.4s)]
*  Now, these cuts are even bigger. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=809.8000000000001s)]
*  But from the last administration, we had the Trump cuts. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=811.72s)]
*  It was a five year deal. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=814.52s)]
*  And it comes to when you add that to the cuts that you already have and other things, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=815.5999999999999s)]
*  amounts according to what they tell me about 68 percent. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=822.0s)]
*  That would mean you'd have a tax so that, you know, that the tax cuts that they got, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=825.2399999999999s)]
*  the biggest tax cuts in our history would immediately go up to that level. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=831.16s)]
*  And that alone is a big chunk of the 68 percent. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=836.52s)]
*  And then you have the other taxes that would accumulate. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=839.88s)]
*  And they say that you'd have about a 68 percent tax increase. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=843.44s)]
*  Sir, you said a moment ago that it won't work out very well for Europe on trade. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=847.32s)]
*  Does that mean you want to cut off those negotiations as well and just tell them what? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=851.48s)]
*  No, well, they've been very tough. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=854.6800000000001s)]
*  Europe, the European Union was formed in order to take advantage of the United States [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=856.12s)]
*  and trade. That was why they were formed. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=860.5600000000001s)]
*  And they're nasty. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=862.52s)]
*  They're very nasty. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=863.6s)]
*  We have a good relationship. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=864.88s)]
*  I'm dealing with Ursula right now and the group. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=866.2s)]
*  But it's a very it's a very tough situation. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=868.9599999999999s)]
*  They have been unbelievably bad to us. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=873.0s)]
*  If you look at past presidents, they've treated them very badly. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=876.3199999999999s)]
*  They're being very nice to me because I get it. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=880.04s)]
*  I know the system and we have the cards. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=882.0799999999999s)]
*  We have the cards far more than they do. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=885.12s)]
*  And they have not treated us well. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=887.68s)]
*  And they're coming to us right now. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=889.6s)]
*  You know, I said I was going to put on a 50 percent tariff as soon as I said that. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=892.0s)]
*  I put it out on truth. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=895.48s)]
*  As soon as I said that, they came to the table. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=897.16s)]
*  They didn't want to come to the table. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=899.1999999999999s)]
*  My people were telling me Scott was telling me and the whole group was telling me that [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=900.6s)]
*  not a good situation. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=907.28s)]
*  They they want to tap it down the line. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=908.48s)]
*  They don't want to really deal. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=910.36s)]
*  So I said, we're going to put a 50 percent tariff on you. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=911.76s)]
*  Then Howard, as you know, was very much involved. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=915.04s)]
*  I'll never forget commerce. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=918.56s)]
*  And he said they don't want to talk. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=920.36s)]
*  As soon as I put that on, I was getting calls from them like, can we meet tomorrow? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=922.48s)]
*  And the problem is they have a lot of very unfair taxes. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=927.16s)]
*  They have a lot of taxes that you wouldn't put on. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=932.12s)]
*  And they they sue all our companies. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=935.0s)]
*  They're constantly suing Apple and Google and all of these companies and getting, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=937.04s)]
*  you know, in front of judges that essentially almost work for them. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=943.28s)]
*  I guess they do work for them. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=946.72s)]
*  The European Union judges. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=947.92s)]
*  He wants that he also wants to, like, enforce his wishes upon sovereign states [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=949.64s)]
*  and entire markets like the EU, like a big part of the tariffs conversation revolves [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=954.88s)]
*  around this as well. Like he wants to he wants to basically shred whatever kind of like value [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=960.1999999999999s)]
*  added tax that they might have that he considers a form of tariffs or something like there [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=964.68s)]
*  is no sovereignty under the Trump rulership. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=973.36s)]
*  There never really was. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=975.88s)]
*  But he's just also casting aside any sort of any sort of optics that there might be [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=977.04s)]
*  some some sovereignty for these countries, like any sort of food and safety standards [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=982.96s)]
*  or regulations that these countries have. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=987.88s)]
*  America wants to completely eviscerate. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=989.44s)]
*  Did you see the same? Very nice. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=992.76s)]
*  Vladimir Putin made some very nice statements today. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=995.32s)]
*  Look, he respects that. It doesn't matter. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=997.8000000000001s)]
*  It doesn't matter. My point is you can't make that decision as a sovereign nation state. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=1000.52s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=1004.6800000000001s)]
*  And he wants that he wants to respects our country. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=1006.2800000000001s)]
*  He wants to gut existing food and safety regulations, food safety standards in these [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=1009.4000000000001s)]
*  countries and then force them to purchase our our products. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=1013.5200000000001s)]
*  For example, we have bad people circulating around this. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrLohkpzEw&t=1017.72s)]
