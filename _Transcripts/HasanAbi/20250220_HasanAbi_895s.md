# Hamas Releases Bodies Of Four Israeli Hostages | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs)
*  No, it's not confirmed yet. The problem here, of course, is that it's all the cards are [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=0.0s)]
*  in Israel's hands. They can say whatever the fuck they want. But the only thing we know, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=7.9s)]
*  the only thing we know is that all the way back in November, 2023 Hamas after another [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=12.96s)]
*  campaign that was ongoing. Okay. Said Israel had killed its own hostages. Anyway, let's [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=19.3s)]
*  get back to this. Hamas has released the four bodies, the bodies of four is really hostages [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=36.260000000000005s)]
*  This morning near Hanunis and over ceremony as music blares Hamas fighters carry the coffins [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=42.46s)]
*  of four dead Israeli hostages, two of them children, the youngest to have been abducted [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=51.32s)]
*  on October the seventh on stage. An offensive propaganda message, blaming offensive propaganda [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=57.8s)]
*  message that Nia is Nazi army killed them with missiles from Zionist warplanes. You [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=66.58s)]
*  can't even call the dude citing you a Nazi or even though the international criminal [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=71.22000000000001s)]
*  court is also calling him a he has a active arrest warrant. Okay. What are we doing? There [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=76.58000000000001s)]
*  is no lie here. This is correct. The minister Netanyahu for their deaths. We don't know [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=83.10000000000001s)]
*  for certain how they were killed. But it was a mass who took them from their homes. I think [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=90.42000000000002s)]
*  was in November, people are getting mad at the way presented. They presented these bodies, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=98.06s)]
*  which the Israeli occupying force literally dropped on unmarked body bags by the truckloads. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=102.30000000000001s)]
*  No, the reason why they presented the bodies this way was because in the month of November, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=106.14s)]
*  this family that was obviously taken hostage by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in the month [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=114.78s)]
*  of November, a year ago, or more than a year ago, Hamas reported that they had died in an Israeli [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=122.34s)]
*  bombing campaign. Okay. The media, including guardian BBC and other Western outlets actually [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=130.22s)]
*  reported on it. It was in November, 20, 20. Okay. November, 20, 23. I remember covering it because [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=137.66s)]
*  I was like, yeah, obviously, what's more likely that this is at the time people were saying, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=147.22s)]
*  Hamas killed them to get their rocks off or something. You know what I mean? And I told you [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=153.06s)]
*  at the time that if Hamas were to kill a hostage, you would know about it because they would do it [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=159.38s)]
*  in broad daylight because hostages are their only leverage. Okay. Of course, they said it was from [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=166.5s)]
*  the Israel bombing. Why would they not? Why would they kill those hostages on their own and then [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=173.3s)]
*  blame Israel? Why wouldn't they just simply keep them alive as they did so many hostages to the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=179.86s)]
*  best of their ability in spite of the endless bombing? And this is not just my attitude on this. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=185.54000000000002s)]
*  This is reported directly from the hostages that have been released in the past 16 months. You [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=190.98000000000002s)]
*  don't just kill hostages for fun when you take hostages. Hostages are your only point of leverage. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=196.9s)]
*  Here. Here's from here. This is from Sky News. Hamas said in November after October the 7th, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=204.98000000000002s)]
*  so quite soon after that, the three Shiri and her two boys had been killed in an Israeli air strike [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=211.54000000000002s)]
*  and they then offered to send the whole family with Yad and two back to Israel and Israel refused [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=218.74s)]
*  saying that this was psychological warfare. So even the New York Times reported back, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=226.98s)]
*  fears grow over fate of Bebas family in Gaza. Hamas's arm wing says the hostages, a mother and [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=231.85999999999999s)]
*  her two young children have been killed in Israeli airstrikes. Israel's military said it was assessing [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=237.22s)]
*  the claim concern for members of the Bebas family, a mother and her two young children who have become [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=240.9s)]
*  symbols of the hostages holding Gaza deep in on Wednesday afternoon when Hamas's arm wing, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=245.94s)]
*  the Al-Qasem Brigades claimed three had been killed in Israeli airstrikes. They literally also [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=248.98s)]
*  said that they would send the bodies back. They also released the father. Why would they kill the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=253.06s)]
*  other three and then let the father go? It just makes no sense. I know. But if your, if your [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=258.34s)]
*  position on this is that these are, you know, barbaric, the rapist monsters who are just [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=263.22s)]
*  operating on no emancipatory purpose or no like logical through line, even if you don't agree with [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=270.82s)]
*  their methods, like the notion that they are operating on pure anger, resentment, and just [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=276.34000000000003s)]
*  want to kill Jewish people because they're anti-Semitic. Yeah. Then you'll believe this. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=281.78s)]
*  And many people do believe that for the record. And that's precisely why they will go around being [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=286.26s)]
*  like, no, you don't understand. They actually killed them. Why? Well, because, you know, for fun. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=290.65999999999997s)]
*  When you are propagandized to that degree, you believe that they are illogical beasts. Exactly. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=302.09999999999997s)]
*  Didn't they tell us when they did kill hostages, thwart plans for Israel to rescue them after the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=306.26s)]
*  ceasefire ended? Yes. There are instances where Hamas has killed hostages. That is when there was [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=309.94s)]
*  a ceasefire negotiation on the table and Israel during that process tried to do another military [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=316.26s)]
*  action. The previous one had killed 250 Palestinians in a campaign. If you recall where they used [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=322.66s)]
*  ambulances, which is also a war crime to do a security operation in coordination with the [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=329.94s)]
*  American forces in the region. Okay. And after that, they try to do another military operation. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=335.14s)]
*  And in the end of that military operation, Hamas, before they died, killed some of the hostages. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=344.58s)]
*  They did. And they openly said that they did. That's my point. That is the only instance where [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=349.62s)]
*  Hamas has actually killed a hostage. Okay. That is the only instance where Hamas killed a hostage. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=354.34s)]
*  That's why I have maintained this position over and long said that if Hamas does execute a hostage, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=360.42s)]
*  you will know about it. They have no reason to randomly kill hostages and not actually [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=367.06s)]
*  randomly kill hostages and then just never really tell anybody about it because it's their only [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=373.54s)]
*  point of leverage. The conditions of the hostages are also a point of leverage. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=379.54s)]
*  Okay. Don't forget what they used that the U S military shit dog at the U S spent. Yeah, exactly. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=385.14000000000004s)]
*  Then a mosque member killed a hostage out of retribution for his family dying, but Hamas [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=391.86s)]
*  didn't sanction it. There might've been another one, but I only remember like one instance. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=394.90000000000003s)]
*  My point is if Hamas kills a hostage, they will, because it's their only point of leverage, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=400.18s)]
*  they will do so publicly. Okay. That's it. And in this circumstance, all the way back in November, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=407.46s)]
*  2023, Western media also reported that Hamas said that this B the Beavis family had been killed [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=415.14s)]
*  under Israeli rocket fire. And then Hamas said that they would release the bodies to Israel. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=423.21999999999997s)]
*  And Israel refused to receive the bodies in November, 2023. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=429.62s)]
*  Tel Aviv's hostage square. They decided not to broadcast footage from the scene. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=436.1s)]
*  A crowd instead watching images. Yeah. Here. Hamas says guard who killed is really hostage acted in [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=442.42s)]
*  revenge against groups instructions. Hamas guard who killed. Okay. This is the other instance, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=448.02s)]
*  I guess, but the only other time I can think of is the, the incident doesn't represent our [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=452.26s)]
*  ethics and the instructions of our religion and dealing with captives. We will reinforce the [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=458.66s)]
*  instructions. He added in a later message on his official telegram channel, the Al-Qassam [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=462.18s)]
*  brigades Hamas arm-wing posted your brutality is an image imminent danger to your prisoners. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=465.78000000000003s)]
*  On Monday, when a mosque first released information about the incident, the Israeli military said it [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=470.1s)]
*  could not corroborate or refute Hamas's account. Is it confirmed as to how the hostages died? No, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=473.62s)]
*  it's not confirmed yet. The problem here, of course, is that it's all the cards are in Israel's [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=479.70000000000005s)]
*  hands. They can say whatever the they want, but the only thing we know, the only thing we know is [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=487.14s)]
*  that all the way back in November, 2023 Hamas, after another campaign that was ongoing, okay, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=492.65999999999997s)]
*  said Israel had killed its own hostages. Okay. This family was killed by an Israeli campaign. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=501.62s)]
*  Israel has killed a bunch of hostages through campaigns. Israel has potentially killed a bunch [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=510.5s)]
*  of Israeli hostages through gassing the tunnels. This was another thing that the parents were [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=516.98s)]
*  demanding restitution for. So some of the hostage family parents wanted additional autopsies to be [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=522.26s)]
*  conducted to actually figure out how a child had died with the suspicion that Israel had killed [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=529.38s)]
*  them. Israel also directly shot and killed hostages. Three of them that had actually [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=536.02s)]
*  been that had actually escaped and they had a white flag and Israel shot them and killed them. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=543.9399999999999s)]
*  That was another famous instance. Israel also, the idea of killed three Israeli hostages in [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=550.9s)]
*  Operation Nusayrah to break out Noah Argamani. Former defense minister and current war criminal [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=557.8599999999999s)]
*  Yoav Galant openly admitted that Israel utilized the Hannibal Directive, which is Israeli military [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=562.9s)]
*  directive that dictates that if there are hostages being taken, it's better to kill those [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=570.02s)]
*  hostages as a military directive. Yoav Galant admitted to using this military directive on [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=574.98s)]
*  October 7 inside of Israeli boundaries. Okay. So there are plenty of deaths and also the [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=581.54s)]
*  deaths of hostages that Israel has contributed to. Okay. The reason for why Israel has the Hannibal [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=591.78s)]
*  Directive is because they would rather kill the Israelis that are being held captive than allow [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=596.98s)]
*  them to be used as leverage. As you can see at the 16 months of endless bombing and an ethnic [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=601.78s)]
*  cleansing campaign has not stopped the Israeli public from consistently protesting against the [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=607.94s)]
*  Netanyahu administration for refusing to come to terms on a ceasefire negotiation that will [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=616.9s)]
*  release their family members or their bodies. Okay. There are plenty of instances where Israel [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=623.62s)]
*  is like either directly shot and killed Israeli hostages or have bombed buildings where Israeli [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=629.78s)]
*  hostages are being kept. Okay. The victims in happier times, they include Oded Lifshitz, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=635.0600000000001s)]
*  a peace activist, and Sharri Bebus and her two young children, Ariel and Kefir. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=643.3s)]
*  Images of the terrified family being taken into Gaza became a symbol of the horror of October 7. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=649.62s)]
*  Shortly after the attacks, we spoke to Sharri's sister-in-law. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=659.22s)]
*  I am a mother of a one-year-old baby and every time I lift him up, I think about the baby. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=663.62s)]
*  She went there without diapers, without food, without pacifier, without clothes, without [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=673.14s)]
*  anything. I don't know how she's taken care of him. The children's father, Yarden, was released [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=679.06s)]
*  alive by Hamas earlier this month. His trauma etched onto his face. The return of his family's [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=685.9399999999999s)]
*  bodies today, a moment of national mourning. It's not just four people. It's more than that. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=695.38s)]
*  It's the sense of helplessness, the fact that this country [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=705.3000000000001s)]
*  could not bring back these people alive. For the Israeli Prime Minister, though, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=715.94s)]
*  today was a moment to promise vengeance, even as talks on extending the ceasefire [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=723.5400000000001s)]
*  and hostage release deal are underway. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=729.54s)]
*  Our loved one's blood is shouting at us from the soil and is obliging us to [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=734.9s)]
*  settle the score with the despicable murderers, and we will. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=738.8199999999999s)]
*  In Gaza, where so much has already been destroyed, Palestinians face their own bitter homecoming. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=743.86s)]
*  Amidst the rubble, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=757.0600000000001s)]
*  we have to dig through this pile, he says. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=764.9s)]
*  I don't see you. Who made that chicken? What are you saying? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3ukbrxdRs&t=786.66s)]
