# Hasan Piker In Q&A With Cambridge Students
**HasanAbi:** [December 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U)
*  I said this originally, obviously Keir Starmer, also known as Keir Stalin. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=0.0s)]
*  He, I mean he was slated to win. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6.32s)]
*  He had the, I mean the Tories had the incumbency disadvantage [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=10.92s)]
*  that everyone experienced all around the globe pretty much, with the exception of Mexico. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=16.04s)]
*  And he was going to win regardless. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=22.32s)]
*  But I was very worried and I think my predictions are coming true already that [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=26.22s)]
*  his approach to fixing all of the problems [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=33.22s)]
*  was a little bit more sombre of a tone than I take normally. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=43.739999999999995s)]
*  Yeah well thank you so much for that speech. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=47.14s)]
*  Just to run through how the rest of the evening will work, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=50.14s)]
*  I'm going to do a moderated interview Q&A and then after a while we're going to throw our open to questions in the audience [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=53.14s)]
*  or bring you a mic just to reiterate this event is being live streamed on Twitch [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=58.620000000000005s)]
*  so bear that in mind when you ask a question if that's something you might not be comfortable with. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=64.62s)]
*  Where I wanted to start, just picking up from where you ended that speech, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=68.62s)]
*  of where we should look to, where people should look to if they want to affect change, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=73.62s)]
*  looking outside the mainstream. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=78.62s)]
*  We've seen a lot of student movements here in Cambridge, over in America, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=80.10000000000001s)]
*  of students taking direct action to try and change the policy of the government towards Palestine. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=84.10000000000001s)]
*  How optimistic are you about the potential for change from these kind of movements? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=89.10000000000001s)]
*  I'm more optimistic than I've ever been because as I kind of alluded to in the end of that speech, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=97.10000000000001s)]
*  anyone that has been aware of the situation in Palestine for longer than, I don't know, five years, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=104.58s)]
*  will be the first to tell you that the attitude from the Western world is dramatically different. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=112.58s)]
*  This doesn't mean that the governments have changed their attitude or shifted their policies, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=119.58s)]
*  although some have, and it's unique, especially, and I stress the importance of the Western world specifically [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=129.06s)]
*  because I think the Global South has known what a settler colonial apparatus looks like [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=135.06s)]
*  with their own personal experience with such things. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=141.06s)]
*  But the allegiances that America needs to maintain in Europe and even its own population [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=145.06s)]
*  and the outlook that people have organically has shifted dramatically in the position of [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=155.54s)]
*  maybe not full-blown emancipation for Palestinians, but at least some recognition for the atrocities. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=161.54s)]
*  I think that is truly unique and it's a sign of hope despite all of the horrifying things that we see on a daily basis. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=167.54s)]
*  What does the path look like for you towards genuine change in the Israel-Palestinian situation? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=177.54s)]
*  I think we have also completely nullified mechanisms of pressure. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=184.01999999999998s)]
*  In the past, we at least had labor unions that even engaged in militancy at times, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=192.01999999999998s)]
*  and we've completely neutered them in the Western world, especially in America. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=198.01999999999998s)]
*  Our labor union participation rate is around 10%. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=204.01999999999998s)]
*  It's actually lower than Chile, which is a country that we specifically wrote the constitution of [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=207.5s)]
*  to institute a neoliberal project there, and they still have a higher labor union participation rate than we do. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=212.5s)]
*  I think that that is one of the major issues. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=218.5s)]
*  I hope that people can focus on unionization and engaging in community activism a little bit more in this process. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=224.5s)]
*  I think that under the Trump administration, people will be forced to do that regardless. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=234.98s)]
*  Participate more in politics by not directly participating in the democratic process, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=239.98s)]
*  but organizations outside of simply voting for the Democratic Party, for example. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=244.98s)]
*  Political actions like that are necessary. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=249.98s)]
*  That's the only way that I think this pressure valve will release. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=252.98s)]
*  Do you think that Western governments' reluctance to endorse rulings such as the ICC against Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=257.46000000000004s)]
*  do you see that as something fundamentally damaging, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=267.46000000000004s)]
*  or are you already less optimistic about how much change those kinds of international institutions can have? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=270.46000000000004s)]
*  I think it's unique. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=277.46000000000004s)]
*  When you see the very fact that the ICC prosecutions are even taking place, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=279.46000000000004s)]
*  it's obvious that this is a new step. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=284.94s)]
*  These organs of international justice, the Geneva Conventions, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=287.94s)]
*  or I guess in American terms the Geneva Suggestions, the United Nations, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=292.94s)]
*  all of these international organs that are supposed to uphold humanitarian laws and principles [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=298.94s)]
*  are historically only used against the enemies of the West. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=306.94s)]
*  And I'm very open about that. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=313.42s)]
*  I believe it was Lindsey Graham that might have had a conversation with Kareem Khan in private. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=316.42s)]
*  Kareem Khan is the current ICC prosecutor that actually facilitated the arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Golan. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=320.42s)]
*  And in that private correspondence, I believe he told him that the ICC is not there for our allies. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=327.42s)]
*  They're there for African warlords and thugs like Putin. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=334.42s)]
*  And technically, throughout its inception, throughout the way that these international organs of justice have worked, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=339.90000000000003s)]
*  that is true. That is what they've usually had in the crosshairs. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=348.90000000000003s)]
*  So I think things are changing, and while this kind of broad sweeping change is not going to happen overnight, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=354.90000000000003s)]
*  I do feel optimistic. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=364.38s)]
*  And ultimately, there is, especially if there's continuous pressure from the public against the governments, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=366.38s)]
*  that inevitably they are going to have to succumb to that pressure. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=377.38s)]
*  Or they're going to have to become more militant and maybe even more fascist in an effort to quell the naysayers, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=381.38s)]
*  the people that are protesting against the government. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=390.38s)]
*  We've seen a little bit of that in America in the way that our campus protests were packed up. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=393.86s)]
*  There were prosecutions that took place, which is very unique in a country where we are supposed to be the bastion of free speech. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=398.86s)]
*  But I think all of that resistance only causes people to grow more and more angry. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=407.86s)]
*  And there's only so much a government can do when there is enough people that say this is inappropriate. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=412.86s)]
*  You've received backlash at Reyes Points for what people perceive as excessive sympathy towards groups like the Houthis or Hezbollah [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=422.34000000000003s)]
*  who share opposition to Israel but may have what many would think of as quite regressive views in other areas. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=431.34000000000003s)]
*  Is that something you think about, worry about? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=437.34000000000003s)]
*  No, not necessarily. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=442.34000000000003s)]
*  In terms of their domestic affairs, a lot of these militant movements, these non-state actors, I am not aligned with at all. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=444.82s)]
*  Having said that, however, that is not the reason for why they are persecuted or killed in many instances. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=455.82s)]
*  Like Hassan Nasrallah, he's homophobic, right? Yeah, I know that. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=464.82s)]
*  But they didn't kill him because he was homophobic, they killed him because he was a part of the axis of resistance. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=470.3s)]
*  So I don't place a lot of emphasis on the internal dynamics and internal policies of these resistance groups [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=478.3s)]
*  just as I don't care that America was homophobic, segregationist and misogynistic when they aligned against the Nazi rise of power. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=487.3s)]
*  They were rooted for the easy company and every time I watch Band of Brothers I still stand up in salute, you know, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=499.78000000000003s)]
*  because they did what had to be done in that regard. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=504.78000000000003s)]
*  And I can't even change the political discourse in my own theoretical democracy. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=509.78000000000003s)]
*  So I feel like the hypothetical conversation that we're having about the civil governance of these militant groups [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=520.26s)]
*  is simply to just say, well, they're bad too, they're bad too, they deserve punishment. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=529.26s)]
*  When in fact the real reason I think people are critical of them is because of their opposition to Israel. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=536.26s)]
*  I mean, I'll take it one step further. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=543.26s)]
*  The Gulf allies that America has have done a metric ton worse things than even Hezbollah has in terms of its own personal civil governance, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=546.74s)]
*  but that's never a point of contention with our allegiance with Saudi Arabia, for example. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=559.74s)]
*  That's unconditional. That allegiance happens because they are a very valuable asset in the region. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=564.74s)]
*  They're a client state. We give them unlimited weapons. They sometimes use those weapons on Yemen. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=571.22s)]
*  And that dynamic is never called into question because I don't think that honest state department employees care about that. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=577.22s)]
*  They care about their goals in the region. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=589.22s)]
*  Aside from domestic political change in the US and across the West, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=592.7s)]
*  what do you think a permanent stable solution looks like in the area that is currently now split between Israel and Palestine? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=597.7s)]
*  So I have a rather controversial opinion on this, I guess, but I take note from the likes of Avi Shlaim, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=606.7s)]
*  who have also evolved in their understanding of Israel-Palestine and have landed them, found themselves in the one state solution camp. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=615.1800000000001s)]
*  And I'm definitely there as well because the settlement expansion project that happened that coincided with the so-called peace process [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=624.1800000000001s)]
*  made a two sovereign state solution virtually impossible. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=635.1800000000001s)]
*  Either you have to forcibly expel 750,000 settlers from both occupied East Jerusalem and occupied West Bank, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=641.66s)]
*  which is not only impossible, but would be very violent. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=650.66s)]
*  Or you recognize that the current order of business is that Israel is the singular sovereign state, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=655.66s)]
*  but it's an apartheid state. And that's the way I approach it. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=663.66s)]
*  I believe that Israel must dissolve its apartheid and offer citizenship to every single Palestinian, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=668.14s)]
*  equal rights, equal representation, and become a secular democracy. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=674.14s)]
*  Israel cannot maintain its demographic concerns. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=680.14s)]
*  Because what are demographic concerns at the end of the day? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=684.14s)]
*  I mean, we have demographic concerns in America, but we know exactly what that means when a white supremacist says [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=687.14s)]
*  we have demographic concerns in America. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=694.62s)]
*  But that calculation is so different when it comes to Israel. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=696.62s)]
*  Israel's demographic concerns are not seen in the same lens of ethnic and religious superiority [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=700.62s)]
*  implemented by one group and completely dominating and subjugating the outsiders in a similar vein as Germany [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=708.62s)]
*  or even South Africa did. It's seen as a mechanism of defense. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=716.62s)]
*  We have security concerns. We have to have a demographic majority. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=722.1s)]
*  I can't think of another state that is in the comfortable bosom of Western Empire [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=727.1s)]
*  that openly states in its laws that they have to populate certain areas with a certain percentage of Jewish people [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=732.1s)]
*  or any kind of ethnic group. It doesn't have to just be Jewish people. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=739.1s)]
*  But that is the reality for Israel. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=745.1s)]
*  So I think that that is old school politics. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=748.58s)]
*  And I think it has no place in the modern world. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=753.58s)]
*  Just to touch on something else you brought up in your speech, social media. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=757.58s)]
*  Do you think that is something that has fundamentally changed politics, sort of the democratization of information? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=761.58s)]
*  Or do you think that it's the same dynamics playing out over a new medium? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=767.58s)]
*  I think it's fundamentally changed politics, sometimes for the good and oftentimes for really awful purposes. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=773.0600000000001s)]
*  I obviously benefit greatly from it. Someone like myself would never be considered a media figure, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=782.0600000000001s)]
*  especially with how isolated mainstream publications are. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=790.0600000000001s)]
*  I feel like I do not fit in the boundaries of permissible speech in mainstream politics and mainstream political discourse. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=797.54s)]
*  There's a lot more space on the right for that sort of thing, but there's rarely ever any space for the left in this conversation. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=807.54s)]
*  So yeah, I greatly benefit from the democratization of media. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=816.54s)]
*  I also understand that for the first time ever we get to see conflict in real life as it's happening, as it's unfolding. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=822.02s)]
*  We get to automatically see the victims of American empire or the victims of Israeli actions as real human beings. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=831.02s)]
*  In the past, I think, and in the early stages, in the immediate aftermath of October 7, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=842.02s)]
*  CNN and numerous other publications basically kept running the same route. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=848.5s)]
*  They immediately had an IDF officer that is tasked with basically propagandizing and contextualizing [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=852.5s)]
*  whichever new fresh hell Israel had unfolded upon the Palestinian population. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=863.5s)]
*  They would go on CNN and immediately talk about how these are terror babies. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=869.5s)]
*  They had to be killed. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=874.98s)]
*  This hospital is a terror headquarters. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=875.98s)]
*  We had to bomb it. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=877.98s)]
*  And because of TikTok and because of various social media platforms, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=878.98s)]
*  people were able to see that that was not the case. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=885.98s)]
*  People were able to see that, no, you're killing regular civilians. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=889.98s)]
*  I know because I watched them on TikTok. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=893.98s)]
*  And I think that that has definitely played a role in people no longer being as confident in legacy publishers. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=898.46s)]
*  But there's also the downsides of the democratization of media. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=907.46s)]
*  Whereas people with whichever mindset can go on and do something that we like to call grifting. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=912.46s)]
*  Where you saw a lot of this during COVID, where people were just straight up saying [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=921.46s)]
*  mainstream narratives on COVID are all false. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=926.94s)]
*  COVID is fake. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=928.94s)]
*  It's not real. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=929.94s)]
*  The vaccines make you gay and autistic. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=930.94s)]
*  Don't take the vaccine. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=933.94s)]
*  And there was plenty of space for that. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=935.94s)]
*  Like some people were actually selling their own personal products and trying to monetize on this. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=937.94s)]
*  But other people were simply doing it because there was a lot of interest in this. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=944.94s)]
*  There was a market for fake information. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=949.94s)]
*  And I don't know how to deal with that. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=953.4200000000001s)]
*  I guess spirited debate is one method. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=957.4200000000001s)]
*  But when the faucet is open and is uncontrollable, when there's so much disinformation, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=960.4200000000001s)]
*  I truly don't know how you deal with that. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=967.4200000000001s)]
*  How do you see your role within that news space? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=971.4200000000001s)]
*  Is it more of an activist, more of a journalist, an entertainer or some kind of mixture of the three? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=974.4200000000001s)]
*  I would say a mixture of the three. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=979.4200000000001s)]
*  I don't call myself a journalist. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=982.9s)]
*  I'm not a political commentator. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=983.9s)]
*  But first and foremost, my goal is to be educational, but also be approachable and appealing and entertaining. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=985.9s)]
*  So I try to make things, I try to make certain subjects that are otherwise complex easier to understand. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=992.9s)]
*  And also entertaining. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1001.9s)]
*  That's the value I think I provide. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1004.9s)]
*  And I try to encourage people to take action as well, whether it be going to a campus protest or whether it be uniting their workplaces [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1009.38s)]
*  or whether it be joining a local organization. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1016.38s)]
*  And many members of my community have gone out and done just that. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1020.38s)]
*  Some have actually gone into local office as well. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1025.3799999999999s)]
*  But outside of that, I also try to combat the misinformation as well. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1028.3799999999999s)]
*  Because there's a lot of that out there. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1035.3799999999999s)]
*  I try to hold people's hands through the process of looking at the news. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1037.8600000000001s)]
*  I look at it with a critical lens. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1045.8600000000001s)]
*  And I try to explain to people the biases that certain outlets might have in favor of a particular direction. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1048.8600000000001s)]
*  You know, omitting key details, burying the lead. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1055.8600000000001s)]
*  Something that a lot of people I think are now familiar with is passive voice. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1058.8600000000001s)]
*  This is something that Americans at least are very knowledgeable on. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1064.34s)]
*  Whenever there's any instance of police brutality, the media always makes it seem as though this chaos unfolded on its own. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1067.34s)]
*  I think mainstream presses utilize the passive voice for all actions that Israel is engaged in as well quite a bit. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1074.34s)]
*  You know, bullets enter the leg of Palestinian. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1082.34s)]
*  Like who shot the Palestinian person? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1086.34s)]
*  Like how do we get here? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1089.34s)]
*  I try to explain to people why there are some editorial controls in this regard. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1091.82s)]
*  But ultimately I rely heavily on mainstream reporting. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1098.82s)]
*  I have wonderful friends in these institutions, these outlets that do a tremendous job. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1102.82s)]
*  And I still greatly value objective news reporting. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1108.82s)]
*  I wouldn't be able to do what I do without it. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1113.82s)]
*  Yeah, and that's very interesting what you say about the passive voice. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1116.82s)]
*  We actually had the head of the BBC here a few weeks ago and asked him about that. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1119.3s)]
*  And it's obviously something they think about, but it's obviously up to you how you interpret where that comes from. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1123.3s)]
*  You did an interview actually on CNN recently where the concept of you being the left's Joe Rogan was brought up, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1129.3s)]
*  which is something you're quite dismissive of. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1136.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1139.3s)]
*  Because you think. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1140.3s)]
*  Because I'm not bald. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1142.3s)]
*  That's the only difference. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1143.3s)]
*  You think it's more about policy. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1145.3s)]
*  It's not about the left finding a Joe Rogan figure. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1148.78s)]
*  It's about the Democratic Party changing its policies. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1150.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1154.78s)]
*  Do you think that is that the right kind of analysis we should take when looking at Donald Trump's election victory? [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1155.78s)]
*  I suppose policy over sort of the more ephemeral stuff, the media communication? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1161.78s)]
*  Yeah, I think absolutely. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1167.78s)]
*  I think Donald Trump represents a shift in attitude towards these institutions [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1169.78s)]
*  that people are obviously very upset about. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1177.26s)]
*  And one of the major gaps in communication for the Democratic Party was their position as the defenders of American institutions. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1179.26s)]
*  And it's very obvious, and this may be a little bit scary to contend with, but Americans don't care about these institutions. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1189.26s)]
*  They don't give a shit. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1196.26s)]
*  They just want the price of eggs to go down. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1197.26s)]
*  They want housing to be more affordable. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1199.26s)]
*  And if one side is at least looking at the anger and frustration that people have and saying, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1202.74s)]
*  you're angry and you're valid to be angry, and you're angry because of marginalized people, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1209.74s)]
*  you're angry because of the establishment, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1214.74s)]
*  you're angry because undocumented migrants have actually taken your social safety nets, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1217.74s)]
*  and the other side is simply saying, no, no, no, you shouldn't be angry. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1222.74s)]
*  Things are good. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1227.74s)]
*  It's a vibe session. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1228.74s)]
*  The economy is actually not that bad. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1229.74s)]
*  You had marginal improvements in your life. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1232.22s)]
*  Why are you complaining? [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1235.22s)]
*  Then, yeah, people are going to be like, I'm angry, and that guy at least recognizes that anger. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1236.22s)]
*  And I think that's what Trump did very well. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1241.22s)]
*  It wasn't because he's like, you know, he's a policy walker or anything. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1244.22s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1248.22s)]
*  But at the very least, there was a recognition of the frustration that people had. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1249.22s)]
*  And then he was able to channel that anger and frustration at appropriate targets. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1253.22s)]
*  That, especially in a country like America, have always been under attack regardless. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1261.7s)]
*  And that's what's very frustrating about this process, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1267.7s)]
*  because Democrats should technically have the right solutions to these issues. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1271.7s)]
*  But if they also are zealous in terms of advancing this neoliberal project, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1277.7s)]
*  this third-way neoliberal attitude, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1285.7s)]
*  unconditionally, they're going to end up losing over and over again [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1288.18s)]
*  to increasingly more right-wing charlatans like Donald Trump. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1292.18s)]
*  Yeah, I know there's a lot of commentators around the Democratic Party [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1296.18s)]
*  and observers here in the UK who would question that characterisation [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1299.18s)]
*  of the Biden presidency in particular as unmitigated neoliberalism. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1304.18s)]
*  They would point to the Build Back Better Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1309.18s)]
*  the infrastructure spending, the student loan stuff. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1314.66s)]
*  They would argue, there's an argument that exists, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1318.66s)]
*  that Biden did all that and he still lost. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1322.66s)]
*  So why does it matter? Why do you think that's wrong? [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1325.66s)]
*  I think that's wrong because this is something that I saw on Twitter [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1328.66s)]
*  that has just burned into my consciousness at this point. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1334.66s)]
*  But if you see a homeless person and you chuck two pennies at them, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1338.66s)]
*  technically their material wealth improved by two cents. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1343.14s)]
*  They had zero, now they have two cents. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1346.14s)]
*  But the homeless person yells back at you, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1348.14s)]
*  he says, fuck you, throw the pennies back. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1350.14s)]
*  Why is the homeless person angry at me? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1352.14s)]
*  I actually improved his material wealth by a dramatic percentage. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1354.14s)]
*  I don't understand. Why is the homeless person so angry at me now? [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1358.14s)]
*  That is the way that the Democratic Party operates. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1361.14s)]
*  When I say we need broad left-wing populism, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1364.14s)]
*  I'm not talking about a technocratic approach [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1367.14s)]
*  that will maybe unfold a decade later. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1370.6200000000001s)]
*  I'm talking about real, genuine, immediate change. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1374.6200000000001s)]
*  Kamala Harris talked about building three million housing units. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1379.6200000000001s)]
*  Now, there's a way to do that that I think is good, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1384.6200000000001s)]
*  and there's a way to communicate that that I think is good, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1388.6200000000001s)]
*  and then there's the way that Kamala Harris communicated it. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1391.6200000000001s)]
*  She said this is the opportunity economy. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1394.6200000000001s)]
*  She said we're going to build three million housing units [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1396.6200000000001s)]
*  in partnership. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1400.1s)]
*  This kind of language is just simply undesirable [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1402.1s)]
*  for people outside of the halls of academia, [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1406.1s)]
*  or people who are really invested in yimby urbanist Twitter. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1409.1s)]
*  That's just the unfortunate reality of it. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1413.1s)]
*  I think she should have come out and been like, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1415.1s)]
*  we're going to build houses, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1417.1s)]
*  we're going to do a federal jobs program, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1419.1s)]
*  we're going to get everybody to work, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1421.1s)]
*  and we're going to build public housing. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1423.1s)]
*  We need to claw back the housing market [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1425.1s)]
*  from the hands of everyone that considers homes [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1427.58s)]
*  to be a speculative asset. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1430.58s)]
*  This is not Wall Street. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1432.58s)]
*  Every American needs home. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1434.58s)]
*  Every American needs shelter, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1436.58s)]
*  and we're going to give that to you. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1438.58s)]
*  That is left-wing populism. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1440.58s)]
*  The technocratic approach [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1442.58s)]
*  that the Democratic Party follows [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1444.58s)]
*  is not left-wing populism. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1446.58s)]
*  It's just, again, private-public partnership, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1448.58s)]
*  tax cuts, deregulation. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1452.58s)]
*  She even talked about deregulating housing. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1454.58s)]
*  Now, that might mean zoning deregulation, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1457.06s)]
*  or that might mean deregulation that makes houses [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1460.06s)]
*  even shittier than they are in America. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1463.06s)]
*  And they aren't pretty shitty. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1465.06s)]
*  So, that's what I mean. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1467.06s)]
*  If you're going to lie, if you're a politician, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1469.06s)]
*  and you're not going to implement [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1472.06s)]
*  any of your actual policies, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1474.06s)]
*  then why not lie about broad, sweeping legislative changes? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1476.06s)]
*  Why simply lie about the most boring, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1481.06s)]
*  technocratic, nerdy ways [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1484.06s)]
*  in which you will not actually implement [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1486.54s)]
*  any sort of reasonable changes [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1488.54s)]
*  that will immediately improve people's lives? [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1490.54s)]
*  So, while Biden did a lot with the NLRB, for example, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1492.54s)]
*  and this is something that I've actually talked about [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1496.54s)]
*  quite a bit, there was a issue [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1498.54s)]
*  with communicating that, in my opinion. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1501.54s)]
*  They failed on that front. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1504.54s)]
*  Republicans campaign every four years, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1506.54s)]
*  or Republicans campaign every single day [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1508.54s)]
*  for four years straight. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1510.54s)]
*  Democrats only campaign once every four years, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1512.54s)]
*  and they remember there's an election. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1515.02s)]
*  And so, on that front, they didn't even do a good enough job [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1517.02s)]
*  of communicating what these changes were [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1520.02s)]
*  that they had implemented. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1522.02s)]
*  They constantly got held up in their own internal strife [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1524.02s)]
*  with the likes of Joe Manchin and Kirsten Sinema [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1528.02s)]
*  that actually undermined some of these bills. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1531.02s)]
*  They were too procedurally invested [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1534.02s)]
*  in the Senate parliamentarian. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1537.02s)]
*  There was supposed to be a bill that was going to pass [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1539.02s)]
*  with a simple majority that would have tacked on [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1542.02s)]
*  a federally mandated increase in $15 minimum wage. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1544.5s)]
*  The Senate parliamentarian said no, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1547.5s)]
*  and the Democrats went, what are you going to do? [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1549.5s)]
*  It's the Senate parliamentarian. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1552.5s)]
*  She said no. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1553.5s)]
*  Okay, fire her, and then hire a new Senate parliamentarian. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1555.5s)]
*  That's precisely what the Republicans had done [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1558.5s)]
*  under Dick Cheney, under the George W. Bush administration. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1560.5s)]
*  There is no reason to hold up these procedures, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1564.5s)]
*  and there's no reason to claim that you are [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1567.5s)]
*  the institutional norm defenders [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1570.5s)]
*  when in fact you have no respect for these institutions [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1573.98s)]
*  at the end of the day anyway, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1575.98s)]
*  and you know for a fact that the Republicans [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1577.98s)]
*  are always going to violate those norms [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1579.98s)]
*  and violate these institutions [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1581.98s)]
*  in an effort to get whatever their agenda is across. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1583.98s)]
*  And Democrats don't do that. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1587.98s)]
*  They don't fight, and I think that people [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1589.98s)]
*  have lost confidence in them as well because of this, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1592.98s)]
*  and they have a long way to go, I think, [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1595.98s)]
*  to reinstate, to recreate that trust in them. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1598.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1603.46s)]
*  As we are here in the UK, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1604.46s)]
*  I thought I'd ask a question about British politics. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1605.46s)]
*  I love that. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1607.46s)]
*  You haven't done the voice so far during the main talk, [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1608.46s)]
*  which I think we're all grateful for, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1611.46s)]
*  but there's still time. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1614.46s)]
*  I'm trying. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1616.46s)]
*  I'm holding on. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1618.46s)]
*  What do you think are the main conclusions [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1620.46s)]
*  that should be drawn from the general election this July [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1623.46s)]
*  and the subsequent first few months of the Stammer government? [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1626.46s)]
*  Oof. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1629.46s)]
*  I said this originally. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1631.94s)]
*  Obviously, Keir Stammer, also known as Keir Stalin. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1633.94s)]
*  He... [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1637.94s)]
*  I mean, he was slated to win. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1640.94s)]
*  He had the... [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1642.94s)]
*  I mean, the Tories had the incumbency disadvantage [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1644.94s)]
*  that everyone experienced all around the globe, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1647.94s)]
*  pretty much, with the exception of Mexico. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1650.94s)]
*  And he was going to win regardless, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1653.94s)]
*  but I was very worried, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1658.42s)]
*  and I think my predictions are coming true already, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1660.42s)]
*  that his approach to fixing all of the problems [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1664.42s)]
*  that England and the UK is experiencing was not enough. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1669.42s)]
*  There was another side of this conversation [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1676.42s)]
*  that didn't get as much coverage, I think, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1678.42s)]
*  even in America, the Reform Party's movement [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1681.42s)]
*  and how successful they were. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1684.42s)]
*  I think that's terrifying. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1686.9s)]
*  And now it seems Nigel Farage is a more popular figure [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1688.9s)]
*  than Keir Stammer already. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1691.9s)]
*  And I said at the time that if Keir Stammer [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1693.9s)]
*  does not immediately work to fund the... [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1698.9s)]
*  and really hire a lot more people [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1701.9s)]
*  and fix public transit [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1704.9s)]
*  and try to fix the housing market in the UK, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1707.9s)]
*  the Reform Party is going to come in, inevitably, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1711.9s)]
*  and sweep. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1715.38s)]
*  And I'm afraid that that is the direction [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1717.38s)]
*  that you guys are heading in, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1720.38s)]
*  not dissimilar to what we're experiencing in America. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1722.38s)]
*  Okay, my final question before we throw it open to the audience, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1726.38s)]
*  a simple one. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1729.38s)]
*  Do you think the world will be a brighter or a darker place [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1731.38s)]
*  in 10 years' time? [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1733.38s)]
*  Oof. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1735.38s)]
*  I want to hope that it's a brighter place, [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1736.38s)]
*  but all trends point to the exact opposite of that, it seems. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1738.38s)]
*  I feel like we are experiencing a lot of chaos [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1742.8600000000001s)]
*  all around the globe. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1745.8600000000001s)]
*  Russia has invaded Ukraine. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1747.8600000000001s)]
*  Now they're talking about potentially North Korean troops [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1750.8600000000001s)]
*  that might be deployed. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1753.8600000000001s)]
*  Obviously, Israel is pummeling Gaza [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1755.8600000000001s)]
*  and is slated to permanently annex North Gaza. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1757.8600000000001s)]
*  They're still bombing Lebanon as well. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1761.8600000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of back and forth happening there, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1763.8600000000001s)]
*  despite the fact that there was supposed to be a ceasefire [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1765.8600000000001s)]
*  with specific carve-outs that allow Israel [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1770.34s)]
*  to continue bombing Lebanon and killing Lebanese people. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1772.34s)]
*  You have, I guess, the in-cell president of South Korea [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1777.34s)]
*  that decided to do the shittiest martial law coup of all time [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1781.34s)]
*  who backed away because quorum was established. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1787.34s)]
*  That was really funny. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1790.34s)]
*  But there's a lot of chaos and a lot of instability, [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1792.34s)]
*  and I think more importantly than all of that, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1795.34s)]
*  there is, especially in the Western world, [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1797.34s)]
*  these liberal democracies that have gone unchecked [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1799.82s)]
*  with no even ostensibly socialist or communist counterpower, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1805.32s)]
*  any other poll that maybe moves people [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1816.32s)]
*  in the opposite direction, have had unlimited neoliberalism [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1819.32s)]
*  for the past three decades. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1823.82s)]
*  I think we're seeing the impact of that now [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1825.82s)]
*  and what that has done to the economies individually, [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1828.3s)]
*  and that's done to the public as a whole. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1833.3s)]
*  I think that a lot of people do not have, [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1837.3s)]
*  a lot of people do not have a lot of optimism [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1843.3s)]
*  for the future, especially our generation and younger, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1844.8s)]
*  and the economic anxieties that they experience, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1847.8s)]
*  if left unaddressed, if left unexamined, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1851.8s)]
*  and I think that's going to continue building [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1854.78s)]
*  the otherwise nascent fascist movements [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1857.78s)]
*  that we've seen in many Western European nations [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1860.78s)]
*  and even Eastern European countries as well. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1863.78s)]
*  You have the AFD in Germany, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1866.78s)]
*  you have the reform movement here, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1868.78s)]
*  you have Marine Le Pen's party in France, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1870.78s)]
*  Maloney is already in power in Italy, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1873.78s)]
*  and it's happening globally. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1876.78s)]
*  You have Donald Trump in America. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1879.78s)]
*  And I think we're all ideologically aligned [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1882.26s)]
*  on the boundaries of nationalism, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1884.26s)]
*  and I'm very fearful about the prospect of the future, [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1887.26s)]
*  especially when there's no mechanism of pushback, [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1891.26s)]
*  and in all of that instability, [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1894.26s)]
*  I think at least historically speaking, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1897.26s)]
*  fascism has always been a means to reinstate control, [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1900.26s)]
*  to institute some stability and control, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1903.26s)]
*  and that's a terrifying prospect for the future. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1906.26s)]
*  Not to be too much of a downer, sorry. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1909.26s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1911.74s)]
*  OK, so now it's time for some questions from the audience. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1912.74s)]
*  If you just stick your hand up [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1915.74s)]
*  and then wait till we get a mic over to you, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1917.74s)]
*  then you can ask your question. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1919.74s)]
*  We will go just here. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1921.74s)]
*  Yep, stand up. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1925.74s)]
*  Hi, I'm Sydney, I go to Daven College. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1927.74s)]
*  I've been a fan for a long time. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1929.74s)]
*  I just wanted to ask, what's your view [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1931.74s)]
*  on the Global South prospects going forward? [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1933.74s)]
*  Because obviously we need to hear news [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1936.74s)]
*  about their constant domination by the West. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1938.74s)]
*  What's your view, what's your optimistic about [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1941.22s)]
*  when you hear the Global South? [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1943.22s)]
*  I mean, I think all things considered, [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1945.22s)]
*  the prospects of the Global South [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1948.22s)]
*  is definitely trending in a more positive direction [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1950.22s)]
*  than the rest of the world. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1953.22s)]
*  And I think that has somewhat to do [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1955.22s)]
*  with Chinese initiatives as well. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1958.22s)]
*  They're offering more favorable loans, [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1961.22s)]
*  they're engaging in development [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1964.22s)]
*  because they're interested in creating a secondary market, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1966.22s)]
*  because everyone understands that the next stage [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1969.7s)]
*  of the Cold War is most likely going to be [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1972.7s)]
*  the United States of America against China. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1975.7s)]
*  And if the tariff faucet opens up, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1978.7s)]
*  all of a sudden you need other developed markets [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1981.7s)]
*  to be able to sell products too. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1984.7s)]
*  So in that process, I think a lot of people [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1986.7s)]
*  are I guess hedging their bets. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1988.7s)]
*  They're leveraging against American dominance. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1990.7s)]
*  And this has been somewhat prosperous [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1993.7s)]
*  for the Global South, [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=1999.18s)]
*  but I don't necessarily know where it goes [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2000.18s)]
*  in the next 10 to 20 years. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2004.18s)]
*  But it's not that bad, all things considered. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2006.18s)]
*  Should we go on the front row here? [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2013.18s)]
*  Hi, first of all, I'd like to thank you [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2020.18s)]
*  for your moral thoughts and your arguments. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2022.18s)]
*  And I think most of us can agree [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2024.18s)]
*  that the people who have directed these crimes [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2026.18s)]
*  are not the ones who are responsible [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2028.66s)]
*  for the full force of justice. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2030.66s)]
*  But I do struggle to see in your arguments [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2032.66s)]
*  actual, long consistency or constancy. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2034.66s)]
*  How you just talked about the Boothies, for example, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2036.66s)]
*  I'm sure it's disturbing, not only for me as a gay man, [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2039.66s)]
*  but for other gay men, when you dismiss things [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2041.66s)]
*  like the murder of tens of people [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2043.66s)]
*  at the hands of the Boothies as a mere internal issue. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2046.66s)]
*  It strikes me that that doesn't see [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2049.66s)]
*  very morally consistent. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2051.66s)]
*  And likewise, I think some of your remarks [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2052.66s)]
*  as you know, in the October 7th massacre, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2056.14s)]
*  the Hamas forces who entered [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2059.14s)]
*  not only murdered hundreds of teenagers our age, [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2062.14s)]
*  but also from the United Nations, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2064.14s)]
*  committed a path in sexual violence, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2066.14s)]
*  targeting many of the most vulnerable women, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2068.14s)]
*  including people who were taken hostage. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2070.14s)]
*  It strikes me to win this argument [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2072.14s)]
*  and to actually provide justice to the causes [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2074.14s)]
*  you seek about, you need to be morally consistent. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2076.14s)]
*  And you need to understand that there's universality [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2078.14s)]
*  in our values, where we must think about women [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2080.14s)]
*  and think about gay people, no matter where they are. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2084.62s)]
*  And I'm wondering, can you always be the most helpful advocate [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2086.62s)]
*  for your causes? [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2088.62s)]
*  Great question. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2090.62s)]
*  So in terms of the sexual violence, [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2091.62s)]
*  I've never denied it, and that there are definitely people [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2097.62s)]
*  that have clipped things out of context [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2102.62s)]
*  to make it seem as though I have, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2104.62s)]
*  but my approach on this has always been consistent. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2106.62s)]
*  Whether it be the Ansarullah administration [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2111.1s)]
*  and the violent actions that they take [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2114.1s)]
*  against the gay Yemeni population, [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2117.1s)]
*  or whether it be any sort of sexual violence [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2121.1s)]
*  that anyone has been victim to, [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2125.1s)]
*  I think that that is completely unacceptable. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2128.1s)]
*  There is no world in which that I would say [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2131.1s)]
*  that the perpetrators of such crimes [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2134.1s)]
*  should not face any justice whatsoever. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2136.1s)]
*  I think that I simply look at historical reference points [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2139.58s)]
*  such as the Nat Turner Rebellion, for example, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2144.58s)]
*  or the Haitian Revolution, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2146.58s)]
*  or even the many acts that the ANC's militant wing [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2148.58s)]
*  engaged in in the struggle to end, [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2152.58s)]
*  abolish the apartheid in South Africa. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2155.58s)]
*  And I recognize that when the dust is settled, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2158.58s)]
*  those historic wrongs must be accounted for, [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2161.58s)]
*  but the much larger problem here [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2166.06s)]
*  is still always going to be the maintenance of the apartheid. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2169.06s)]
*  So it's not necessarily that I dismiss these acts. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2173.06s)]
*  It might come across as dismissive, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2177.06s)]
*  but the reason as to why I cover it in the way that I do [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2179.06s)]
*  is because I understand that there is still [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2183.06s)]
*  a much greater problem, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2187.06s)]
*  and I consider many of the ways in which people bring this up [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2190.06s)]
*  to be, I wouldn't say what about-ism, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2195.54s)]
*  but to serve the purpose of deflecting away from, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2199.54s)]
*  deflecting the attention away from Israel's actions. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2203.54s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2207.54s)]
*  Shall we go right there in the third row? [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2212.54s)]
*  Yeah, you? Yeah. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2215.54s)]
*  Um, where's somebody? [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2218.02s)]
*  It's up to you. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2221.02s)]
*  Hi, I was struggling whether or not to ask this question, [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2223.02s)]
*  but potentially following on from what was just asked. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2226.02s)]
*  I do appreciate the work that you do for the left. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2229.02s)]
*  I don't want to diminish the extent to which you advocate [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2232.02s)]
*  for people's, you know, general rights, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2235.02s)]
*  especially women. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2237.02s)]
*  However, I think maybe the person was politically, [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2239.02s)]
*  so you have been embroiled in controversy. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2241.02s)]
*  I have a view of you as sex workers in your personal life, [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2243.02s)]
*  but should you openly speak on. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2246.5s)]
*  I support making the safety and autonomy of sex workers [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2248.5s)]
*  a priority, I don't oppose the criminalisation [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2251.5s)]
*  of women who take part in this kind of labour. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2253.5s)]
*  But I equally think that if we are to accept [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2255.5s)]
*  the premise that all work is ultimately coercive [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2258.5s)]
*  and that sex work is work, which I think you both [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2260.5s)]
*  agree on that, then what is the word that we're using [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2262.5s)]
*  in society for coerced sex, right? [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2265.5s)]
*  Secondly, do you accept that, hedging your bets, [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2267.5s)]
*  that sex workers we see are wholly consenting [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2269.5s)]
*  is perhaps naive, especially insofar as a plumber, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2272.5s)]
*  fixing your bathroom, who's in a tricky situation, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2275.98s)]
*  is it uncomfortable in terms of the degree [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2277.98s)]
*  of suffering undertaken, like in terms of a woman [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2279.98s)]
*  engaging in sex work, for example, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2282.98s)]
*  due to her options? [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2284.98s)]
*  No, absolutely. You're absolutely correct in terms [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2286.98s)]
*  of the extra coercion that might take place, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2288.98s)]
*  and in many instances, it is a very real problem. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2290.98s)]
*  But I think that my approach to this has always been, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2293.98s)]
*  first of all, I've dated sex workers as well, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2296.98s)]
*  I'm very public and very open about my advocacy [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2298.98s)]
*  for sex work. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2301.98s)]
*  In terms of the moral dynamic of it, [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2304.46s)]
*  yes, I understand that there is a difference there, [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2308.46s)]
*  as long as people are voluntarily, as adults, [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2311.46s)]
*  consenting to the act, and the only way, I think, [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2314.46s)]
*  to ensure that that is the case is to sanitize sex work [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2318.46s)]
*  in general, but also make sure that there are proper [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2324.46s)]
*  mechanisms in place to ensure that this is a safe process, [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2328.46s)]
*  that people are not engaging in this act involuntarily. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2332.94s)]
*  So I understand your concerns, this is something [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2337.94s)]
*  that I've talked about with many sex workers, [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2341.94s)]
*  both on my stream and outside of that, [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2344.94s)]
*  and they seem to think that the best possible pathway [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2347.94s)]
*  forward is through decriminalization and destigmatization, [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2353.94s)]
*  and that the ways in which we currently interpret [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2357.94s)]
*  currently analyzed sex work is only unhelpful [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2362.42s)]
*  because it makes it virtually impossible to seek out help [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2365.42s)]
*  and to ensure that these criminal elements [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2370.42s)]
*  that are truly atrocious are prosecuted with [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2373.42s)]
*  and dealt with. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2378.42s)]
*  Should we go right in the back corner over there? [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2382.42s)]
*  Okay, go ahead. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2385.9s)]
*  Trinity College is the largest and by far [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2391.9s)]
*  the richest college at Cambridge. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2394.9s)]
*  It built over two billion pounds worth of wealth [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2396.9s)]
*  through all the various means you would probably expect, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2399.9s)]
*  including continued investment in arms companies [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2402.9s)]
*  like Albert Systems. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2405.9s)]
*  After student pressure and protest last year, [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2407.9s)]
*  the college pledged its life best. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2410.9s)]
*  In October, the college broke that promise, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2411.9s)]
*  saying that they regretted creating hardship funds [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2415.38s)]
*  for students affected by conflict. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2418.38s)]
*  My question given this is, as a student at that college, [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2421.38s)]
*  who has been involved in organizing direct action, [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2424.38s)]
*  I have been staggered by the apathy of my peers. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2427.38s)]
*  How can students encourage other students to use their voices [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2430.38s)]
*  to pressurize the institutions in which they exist, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2433.38s)]
*  and how can students stable demoralization [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2436.38s)]
*  when shouting at ears that seem not to be listening? [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2439.38s)]
*  Yeah, that's a tough one. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2445.38s)]
*  So I think that you have to see the successes [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2447.38s)]
*  that you have gained through direct participation [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2452.38s)]
*  and direct action, such as the college encampments, [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2457.38s)]
*  and keep the pressure as best as you can [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2461.38s)]
*  and continue the struggle, because at the end of the day, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2465.38s)]
*  there's only so much pressure [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2470.38s)]
*  that these institutions can withstand. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2471.38s)]
*  If there is more and more protests [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2474.86s)]
*  and more and more disorder, civil disobedience, [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2476.86s)]
*  campuses are inevitably going to have to buckle. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2479.86s)]
*  And there are many different examples [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2483.86s)]
*  of success in this regard. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2484.86s)]
*  There is a lot of academic divestment [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2486.86s)]
*  that is occurring already, [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2489.86s)]
*  but I'm sorry to hear that Trinity College [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2491.86s)]
*  went back on their promise [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2494.86s)]
*  and is continuing to fund Elbit systems. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2496.86s)]
*  It's a truly heinous company. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2504.86s)]
*  Shall we go right on the back row there? [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2510.86s)]
*  Hi, thank you. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2517.86s)]
*  You've kind of previously made comments [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2519.86s)]
*  about streets so threading, [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2520.86s)]
*  the campus flood of landlords, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2522.86s)]
*  an era of really endemic political violence [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2524.86s)]
*  where I'm pretty sure we've seen [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2527.86s)]
*  two MPs killed in the last two years. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2529.86s)]
*  Do you have some constructive way [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2532.34s)]
*  of bringing an ethnic position [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2534.34s)]
*  or criticizing capitalism [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2536.34s)]
*  and the role of landlords into this discourse? [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2537.34s)]
*  Or is it something you can say from behind the camera [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2539.34s)]
*  that actually has real consequences [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2542.34s)]
*  that doesn't actually make the impact [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2543.34s)]
*  that you'd like to make? [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2545.34s)]
*  I was talking to a landlord [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2547.34s)]
*  when I had that conversation, [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2549.34s)]
*  and I don't think that he had an issue with it. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2550.34s)]
*  He knew that we were messing around. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2552.34s)]
*  But given that this is a, what, now six-year-old, [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2554.34s)]
*  conversation that I had [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2561.82s)]
*  with a landlord friend of mine at the time, [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2562.82s)]
*  yeah, I wouldn't take that too seriously. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2565.82s)]
*  But thank you. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2568.82s)]
*  No, I am not an advocate for killing landlords. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2569.82s)]
*  Shall we go right there? [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2577.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2579.82s)]
*  Thank you so much for your speech. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2582.82s)]
*  It seems over the past five years, [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2584.82s)]
*  the Left has spent a lot of time [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2586.82s)]
*  building up defenses against hate speech [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2588.82s)]
*  which in the past year, year and a half, [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2591.3s)]
*  have been really turned against us [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2594.3s)]
*  on college campuses. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2596.3s)]
*  In England, the child of Holocaust survivors [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2598.3s)]
*  was arrested for terrorist speech. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2602.3s)]
*  Why does it seem that only the Right fights for free speech? [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2604.3s)]
*  Why does the Left not fight for free speech? [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2608.3s)]
*  And should the Left fight for free speech? [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2610.3s)]
*  So that's an interesting question [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2615.3s)]
*  because I think that historically, [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2617.3s)]
*  the Left has fought for free speech [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2620.78s)]
*  and this still has limitations. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2622.78s)]
*  I guess if you're talking about free speech [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2625.78s)]
*  in the American understanding [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2627.78s)]
*  because that's the most expansive, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2628.78s)]
*  we have never really abided by the principles [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2630.78s)]
*  of free speech to begin with. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2635.78s)]
*  It seemingly only encompasses protecting hate speech [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2637.78s)]
*  and rarely ever speech that is truly disruptive [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2642.78s)]
*  to the pre-existing hierarchies. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2646.78s)]
*  What I mean by that is, [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2649.26s)]
*  and this has happened in the UK as well historically, [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2651.26s)]
*  we're fascists. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2654.26s)]
*  When they protest in the streets, [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2655.26s)]
*  they get police protection. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2656.26s)]
*  And if there's any sort of socialist uprising [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2660.26s)]
*  or leftist uprising, [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2664.26s)]
*  they're usually the ones who have to face [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2666.26s)]
*  police brutality and police violence, [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2668.26s)]
*  at least historically. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2670.26s)]
*  America, like I said, [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2672.26s)]
*  has the most expansive free speech protections [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2674.26s)]
*  and yet in 32, if I'm not mistaken, [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2676.26s)]
*  it might be 36 now, [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2678.7400000000002s)]
*  states in the United States of America, [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2679.7400000000002s)]
*  you actually have to sign a pledge [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2681.7400000000002s)]
*  if you want to become a school teacher [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2685.7400000000002s)]
*  in the state of Texas, for example. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2688.7400000000002s)]
*  You have to sign a pledge that says [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2689.7400000000002s)]
*  you will never engage in BDS, [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2690.7400000000002s)]
*  Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions on the State of Israel, [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2692.7400000000002s)]
*  which is, once again, [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2695.7400000000002s)]
*  a formerly successful initiative [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2697.7400000000002s)]
*  against apartheid South Africa. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2700.7400000000002s)]
*  That's where BDS comes from originally [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2701.7400000000002s)]
*  and yet we have these very obvious [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2703.7400000000002s)]
*  restrictions on free speech when it comes to Israel. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2708.22s)]
*  I think that ultimately [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2711.22s)]
*  the notion that there is free speech absolutism [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2714.22s)]
*  is somewhat silly. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2718.22s)]
*  It's never really existed [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2722.22s)]
*  and I think that there are well-established boundaries [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2724.22s)]
*  that many people agree to across the board. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2727.22s)]
*  Like, there are certain kinds of freedom of expression [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2731.22s)]
*  that obviously should be considered criminal. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2735.7s)]
*  Child pornography, for example, [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2739.7s)]
*  that's not protected under free speech. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2741.7s)]
*  And some places are more expansive, [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2744.7s)]
*  others are not, [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2747.7s)]
*  but ultimately I think it doesn't really matter. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2748.7s)]
*  There's no real champions of free speech absolutism [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2751.7s)]
*  that doesn't exist. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2755.7s)]
*  I guess maybe with the exception of Noam Chomsky, [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2756.7s)]
*  I've rarely ever heard anyone make a convincing [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2759.7s)]
*  free speech absolutist argument [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2762.7s)]
*  that is genuine. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2765.18s)]
*  It's just not something that the right believes in. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2769.18s)]
*  That's why they have been able to portray themselves [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2771.18s)]
*  as champions of free speech [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2776.18s)]
*  in an effort to get away with hate speech [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2777.18s)]
*  without any consequence whatsoever [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2781.18s)]
*  because free speech doesn't mean that there should be [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2783.18s)]
*  any sort of freedom from consequences. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2786.18s)]
*  And yet they have positioned themselves [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2789.18s)]
*  as champions of free speech [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2792.18s)]
*  while simultaneously in the United States of America, [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2793.66s)]
*  at least, right-wing groups are responsible [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2796.66s)]
*  for book bannings, [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2799.66s)]
*  books being pulled out of libraries all across the country. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2802.66s)]
*  They very successfully launched an initiative [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2805.66s)]
*  against what they consider to be CRT, [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2807.66s)]
*  critical race theory, [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2809.66s)]
*  woke DEI policies and the like, [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2811.66s)]
*  and they have truly undermined free speech [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2813.66s)]
*  and free expression, [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2816.66s)]
*  and also just like a normal education [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2818.66s)]
*  about American history. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2820.66s)]
*  And they've been doing this very successfully [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2822.14s)]
*  while simultaneously pointing the finger of blame [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2824.14s)]
*  at the left. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2826.14s)]
*  So I think ultimately we just have to be reasonable about it [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2827.14s)]
*  and understand that there are very real limitations [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2831.14s)]
*  to such things. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2835.14s)]
*  And when people cynically try to regulate free speech [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2836.14s)]
*  with honest parties that are involved in spirited debate, [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2842.14s)]
*  then you can shout them down a little bit. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2847.14s)]
*  You can tell them, no, that's not the case. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2850.62s)]
*  I think one very clear example of this [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2852.62s)]
*  is the conversation surrounding Israel-Palestine. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2854.62s)]
*  In America, we censured Rashida Tlaib. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2860.62s)]
*  She's a Palestinian congressperson. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2864.62s)]
*  We censured her in our Congress [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2866.62s)]
*  because she said, [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2869.62s)]
*  from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2870.62s)]
*  This is an emancipatory slogan [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2872.62s)]
*  that I think people cynically claimed was anti-Semitic [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2873.62s)]
*  and censured her. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2879.1s)]
*  No such censure exists for the likes of Tom Cotton, [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2880.1s)]
*  who very famously wrote a New York Times article [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2884.1s)]
*  demanding that Black Lives Matter protesters [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2887.1s)]
*  be violently squashed by the military. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2890.1s)]
*  Tom Cotton, who has demanded that pro-Palestinian protesters [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2893.1s)]
*  and environmental activists be killed for protesting [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2897.1s)]
*  and blocking roads. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2899.1s)]
*  There is a Louisiana Senator, Kennedy, [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2901.1s)]
*  who in a congressional hearing about anti-Semitism, [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2905.58s)]
*  hate speech and Islamophobia, [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2911.58s)]
*  turned to an Arab speaker and said, [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2913.58s)]
*  that she was in support of Hamas, Hezbollah, [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2917.58s)]
*  and that she should put her head in a bag in shame. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2921.58s)]
*  No censures existed there. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2926.58s)]
*  So no one is really principled on this. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2929.58s)]
*  And I think it's important to point out [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2933.06s)]
*  those inconsistencies and just say, [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2937.06s)]
*  look, in order for there to be a productive conversation, [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2939.06s)]
*  there's gonna be some boundaries. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2942.06s)]
*  And if there are no boundaries, [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2944.06s)]
*  then you're not gonna be able to have [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2947.06s)]
*  a productive conversation. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2949.06s)]
*  So that's what I think at the end of the day. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2951.06s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2953.06s)]
*  It's not a very great example. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2954.06s)]
*  It's not a very great way to end that point, [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2956.06s)]
*  but it's not something that I have [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2959.54s)]
*  any sort of like well-defined perspective on. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2964.54s)]
*  It's a case-by-case basis. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2966.54s)]
*  I'll know it when I see it. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2968.54s)]
*  Let's go just in the green. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2973.54s)]
*  Considering the success of right-wing initiatives [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2980.54s)]
*  across the West, [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2983.54s)]
*  how do you think people will impact the way [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2984.54s)]
*  in which left-wing speakers conduct themselves? [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2986.54s)]
*  And do you think we will see that when politicians [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2989.02s)]
*  engage in any more centrist policies [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2991.02s)]
*  or perhaps engage in a type of rhetoric [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2993.02s)]
*  we see from the West as their right-wing counterparts? [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2995.02s)]
*  Oof. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=2998.02s)]
*  I hope that they don't do that, [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3001.02s)]
*  but all signs point to that right now. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3003.02s)]
*  I mean, Seth Malton came out and immediately [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3006.02s)]
*  after the election defeat was like, [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3008.02s)]
*  oh, we lost because the Democratic Party [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3010.02s)]
*  was too pro-trans. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3013.02s)]
*  It's not, that was never even a conversation. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3015.5s)]
*  There was no trans speaker, the DNC. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3018.5s)]
*  The Democrats didn't even aesthetically point [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3020.5s)]
*  to any marginalized communities and said, [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3023.5s)]
*  we're going to defend you guys. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3025.5s)]
*  They didn't even do that. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3026.5s)]
*  They went super right-wing. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3028.5s)]
*  And it seems like they are more comfortable [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3030.5s)]
*  capitulating to right-wing framing on issues [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3033.5s)]
*  like we saw with the conversations surrounding [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3035.5s)]
*  undocumented migrants and what to do. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3038.5s)]
*  America is a nation of immigrants. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3041.5s)]
*  The reason why we have not, [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3042.98s)]
*  we have not fallen in the trap that many [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3044.98s)]
*  developed countries have in terms of their [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3047.98s)]
*  population growth, the stunting, [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3050.98s)]
*  is because of the unrestricted immigration [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3052.98s)]
*  into the country that has kept the nation young. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3055.98s)]
*  And yet the Democratic Party this time around [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3058.98s)]
*  did something that I truly consider to be [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3063.98s)]
*  unconscionable where they caved on the right-wing [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3066.98s)]
*  framing on this issue. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3069.98s)]
*  And basically admitted that undocumented [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3071.46s)]
*  immigrants constitute a national security threat. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3074.46s)]
*  So if they go in that direction, [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3077.46s)]
*  they're just going to keep losing as the right [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3079.46s)]
*  continues to increase the stakes. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3082.46s)]
*  Because there's no world in which you can outflank [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3084.46s)]
*  the Republican Party on hate, on bigotry. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3087.46s)]
*  That's their territory. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3090.46s)]
*  That's the comfortable space that they exist in. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3091.46s)]
*  So they're just going to keep upping the ante, [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3093.46s)]
*  the right is, as the Democrats try to catch up. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3097.46s)]
*  And make a fool of themselves. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3100.94s)]
*  And even if they were to be able to successfully, [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3103.94s)]
*  I guess, capture the attention of white [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3106.94s)]
*  nativists who want this kind of anti-immigrant [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3109.94s)]
*  agenda, do we really want that is the question [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3112.94s)]
*  that Democrats should ask themselves. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3115.94s)]
*  Let's go right over there in the third row, [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3120.94s)]
*  in the pink. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3123.94s)]
*  Hi guys. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3127.94s)]
*  I just wanted to ask, since you're known for [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3129.42s)]
*  blending humor with serious political discussion, [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3131.42s)]
*  in your opinion, what is the role of comedy [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3134.42s)]
*  and satire in shaping political views? [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3137.42s)]
*  How do you prevent this from possibly undermining [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3140.42s)]
*  the gravity of the issues you're trying to address? [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3143.42s)]
*  Ooh. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3146.42s)]
*  I feel like there's a time and space for it, right? [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3149.42s)]
*  I'll crack a couple jokes here and there, [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3152.42s)]
*  but obviously if I'm going to be talking about [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3155.42s)]
*  very serious things that are happening, [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3157.9s)]
*  I try to limit the ways in which I quip. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3159.9s)]
*  But I think comedy is a very important tool [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3165.9s)]
*  in helping people understand the world. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3168.9s)]
*  Good comedy, specifically comedy that punches up, [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3171.9s)]
*  exposes the idiocy of normal existence [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3174.9s)]
*  and has the capacity to undermine pre-existing [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3180.9s)]
*  social hierarchies that we take for granted. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3186.38s)]
*  So I value it quite a bit, [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3188.38s)]
*  but there's a time and place for it. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3190.38s)]
*  I think that there are certain things that, [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3193.38s)]
*  I guess the higher the stakes get, [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3195.38s)]
*  the trickier it gets to be able to truly find humor [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3199.38s)]
*  in otherwise very humorless situations. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3204.38s)]
*  And a good comedian can take that and find humor in it. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3207.38s)]
*  Whereas many who don't actually end up, [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3212.86s)]
*  I think, coming across as though they're reactionary. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3217.86s)]
*  This is a problem that happens a lot. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3220.86s)]
*  Comedians test their bits. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3222.86s)]
*  If they want to be edgy and they fail and they bomb, [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3223.86s)]
*  they come across like they genuinely believe these things. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3227.86s)]
*  These are firmly held opinions. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3230.86s)]
*  That's what it comes across as. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3232.86s)]
*  And I try to be as unrestrictive as possible [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3233.86s)]
*  and as understanding and as charitable as possible [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3237.86s)]
*  to people who are trying to make other people laugh. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3240.34s)]
*  But having said that, I think it's both a very important tool [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3243.34s)]
*  and maybe sometimes something that has no place [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3246.34s)]
*  in certain subject matter. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3250.34s)]
*  At least I'm not well equipped enough [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3253.34s)]
*  to be able to make jokes about certain things. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3255.34s)]
*  Okay, we've got time for a couple more questions [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3259.34s)]
*  before the end. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3261.34s)]
*  We'll go there. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3262.34s)]
*  Yeah, you and the college puffer. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3264.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3267.82s)]
*  Hello. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3278.82s)]
*  I'd like to ask you about your inconsistencies [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3280.82s)]
*  when it comes to Russian and Ukraine [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3282.82s)]
*  in terms of your takes on the Israel outside. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3284.82s)]
*  It's a little about assessing the policy [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3286.82s)]
*  which I agree is a horrible act. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3288.82s)]
*  But when considering Russian annexation of Ukraine, [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3290.82s)]
*  you quote, say, [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3293.82s)]
*  at the bottom of my mind, [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3296.3s)]
*  Crimea belongs to Ukraine. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3297.3s)]
*  And when you talked about Crimea, [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3299.3s)]
*  you should have said Ukraine. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3301.3s)]
*  But you just sticked it back to Mongolia, I think. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3303.3s)]
*  No. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3305.3s)]
*  I said Crimea belongs primarily to the Tatar population. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3306.3s)]
*  Which is historically... [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3309.3s)]
*  Greece, Russia, and... [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3311.3s)]
*  I said Greece. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3312.3s)]
*  I said Turkey and Greece. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3313.3s)]
*  That was a joke. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3314.3s)]
*  So... [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3316.3s)]
*  I don't think, for the record, [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3318.3s)]
*  I don't think Crimea belongs to Turkey. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3319.3s)]
*  Just so you understand. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3322.3s)]
*  Maybe you didn't get it. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3324.78s)]
*  But I don't think that that's valid. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3325.78s)]
*  The other question... [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3327.78s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3328.78s)]
*  In addition to this, [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3330.78s)]
*  when you were asked for your opinion on the ceasefire, [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3331.78s)]
*  you mentioned Boris Johnson as the reason for why it failed [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3335.78s)]
*  given that Boris Johnson's arrival [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3338.78s)]
*  was on the 9th April. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3340.78s)]
*  And then Lavrov mentioned that his arrival was a few years ago [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3342.78s)]
*  on the 9th April. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3346.78s)]
*  And Lavrov himself said on the 7th April, [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3347.78s)]
*  way before that happened, [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3349.78s)]
*  that Ukrainian demands are acceptable [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3350.78s)]
*  and they used to be or would not happen. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3354.26s)]
*  So the question is, why do you flirt so much [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3356.26s)]
*  with Russian narratives when it comes to Russia and Ukraine? [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3359.26s)]
*  So in terms of Russia's annexation of Ukrainian territory, [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3364.26s)]
*  I think it's wholly unjustifiable and inhumane and very cruel. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3368.26s)]
*  I've made that very clear time and time again. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3371.26s)]
*  As far as the ceasefire negotiation, [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3374.26s)]
*  I believe you're talking about the 15-point plan [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3377.26s)]
*  that was discussed in Antalya, if I'm not mistaken. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3379.26s)]
*  At a time when Ukraine had maximum leverage [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3383.7400000000002s)]
*  in comparison to where it is now, [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3386.7400000000002s)]
*  and there is no inconsistency in that narrative, [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3388.7400000000002s)]
*  especially because I was a champion of a ceasefire [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3392.7400000000002s)]
*  for Ukraine very early on, [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3397.7400000000002s)]
*  just as I am a champion for ceasefire [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3400.7400000000002s)]
*  in Israel-Palestine as well. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3402.7400000000002s)]
*  Because first and foremost, [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3404.7400000000002s)]
*  I think what we have to do is stop the bleeding. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3405.7400000000002s)]
*  And I thought that the Ukrainian leverage at the time [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3408.7400000000002s)]
*  was much better, [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3413.22s)]
*  and I actually celebrated Zelensky [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3414.22s)]
*  for engaging in this conversation in a very meaningful way [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3418.22s)]
*  where even trickier demands that he could have made [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3422.22s)]
*  that would have been tricky [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3426.22s)]
*  for the Ukrainian population to accept, [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3427.22s)]
*  he was conciliatory on where he wanted to push [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3430.22s)]
*  the Crimea question back to a referendum [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3433.22s)]
*  15 years in the future. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3435.22s)]
*  And I think that that was a very solid way [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3437.22s)]
*  to potentially try and stop the Russian ocelot. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3440.22s)]
*  Now, make no mistake, I don't believe that Russia [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3442.7s)]
*  was going to be committed to the ceasefire negotiation, [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3446.7s)]
*  either that much I made clear as well. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3449.7s)]
*  But the point I always stressed was, [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3451.7s)]
*  ultimately every conflict ends with treaties, [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3454.7s)]
*  and that the quicker you can arrive at that position [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3459.7s)]
*  when you have the most amount of leverage, [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3461.7s)]
*  the better it will be to save the lives [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3464.7s)]
*  of countless people in Ukraine. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3467.7s)]
*  And I believe, unfortunately, that is what has happened. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3470.18s)]
*  In terms of Russian posturing on the ceasefire process, [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3473.18s)]
*  you mentioned Lavrov, yeah, [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3476.18s)]
*  they have the same political pressures, [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3478.18s)]
*  maybe not to the same degree as Zelensky does, [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3482.18s)]
*  but they have the same political pressures. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3485.18s)]
*  They have to posture, [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3486.18s)]
*  they have to make themselves look strong. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3487.18s)]
*  I think ultimately what matters is [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3489.18s)]
*  what you leave on the table [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3491.18s)]
*  and what you come to terms with. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3493.18s)]
*  And one thing that I stressed over and over again [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3495.18s)]
*  for people who kept saying, this is appeasement, [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3497.18s)]
*  at the time, this was years ago at this point, [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3499.66s)]
*  was that if the ceasefire process falls apart [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3502.66s)]
*  and if Russia continues to bomb Ukraine, [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3508.66s)]
*  then you're still back to square one. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3512.66s)]
*  So nothing technically changes, [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3514.66s)]
*  with the exception of a period of stability. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3517.66s)]
*  So I am always going to be in favor of [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3520.66s)]
*  trying to maintain any sort of treaty [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3524.66s)]
*  or any sort of ceasefire in general. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3528.14s)]
*  Same with Lebanon and same with Gaza. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3531.14s)]
*  So I don't think it's inconsistent at all. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3534.14s)]
*  Okay, and we will take one final question. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3537.14s)]
*  Let's go right, [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3540.14s)]
*  all the way at the back in the corner over there. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3543.14s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3551.14s)]
*  Ukraine is a potential establishment [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3553.14s)]
*  and say we need left-wing populism. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3555.14s)]
*  So why have you not really criticized [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3557.62s)]
*  or colluded with the establishment on several occasions [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3559.62s)]
*  to denigrate existing left-wing populist movements [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3561.62s)]
*  like the Galloway and the Workers' Party [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3564.62s)]
*  and Jackson and Paul Haslop [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3566.62s)]
*  being the American Communist Party, which needs that? [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3568.62s)]
*  Did you say I've denigrated George Galloway? [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3573.62s)]
*  Is that what you said? [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3575.62s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3576.62s)]
*  I don't think I did, but... [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3577.62s)]
*  Well, you denigrated him. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3579.62s)]
*  I don't think I've done that, but... [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3581.62s)]
*  As far as the American Communist Party, [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3585.1s)]
*  you know, more power to them. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3588.1s)]
*  If they're able to successfully mobilize, [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3590.1s)]
*  then that's great. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3593.1s)]
*  Do I trust Jackson Hinkle, former Hassan Abihed, [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3594.1s)]
*  to not be a federal agent [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3598.1s)]
*  and be genuinely invested in the uplifting [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3601.1s)]
*  of the working class all around the globe? [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3604.1s)]
*  Time will tell. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3606.1s)]
*  I think if someone is going to occupy Ukrainian territory [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3608.1s)]
*  and then, you know, posturing alongside the Russian forces [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3612.58s)]
*  and then freely travelling back to the United States, [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3616.58s)]
*  I'm going to look at that guy and go, [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3619.58s)]
*  maybe you're a Fed. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3621.58s)]
*  OK, that's not... [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3623.58s)]
*  I'm just saying, you know, that's my red line, usually. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3625.58s)]
*  There's a lot of infiltrators, [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3628.58s)]
*  there's a lot of infiltrators [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3630.58s)]
*  that historically have tried to undermine [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3632.58s)]
*  any kind of leftist mobilization, [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3637.58s)]
*  and I think that that's a pretty valid argument [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3639.58s)]
*  and that's a pretty valid red line for me, at least. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3642.06s)]
*  Like, it goes beyond reasonable disagreement [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3644.06s)]
*  when you're, you know, [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3647.06s)]
*  when you are positioning yourself as someone [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3650.06s)]
*  who is going to be against America [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3653.06s)]
*  every step of the way. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3656.06s)]
*  Many people that have come before you [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3658.06s)]
*  in this great deliberative body [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3661.06s)]
*  have criticized me for even misunderstanding my positions [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3663.06s)]
*  and saying that I am a [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3666.06s)]
*  unconditional anti-American commentator, [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3668.54s)]
*  but I think I'm a little bit more reasonable than that. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3671.54s)]
*  For me, if you go to occupied Ukrainian territory [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3673.54s)]
*  to do propaganda for the Russian government, [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3677.54s)]
*  which is not a socialist government at all, [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3679.54s)]
*  and it's a, you know, [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3682.54s)]
*  autocrat-backed plutocracy [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3684.54s)]
*  that is engaging in completely unjustifiable actions [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3689.54s)]
*  and engaging in slaughter of people, [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3693.54s)]
*  I think that's, you know, [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3697.02s)]
*  and then you were freely able to travel back [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3699.02s)]
*  to the United States, I'm going to be like, [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3701.02s)]
*  oh, this might be a fed. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3703.02s)]
*  Okay, we're going to have one more. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3705.02s)]
*  We're going to squeeze one more extra in after that one. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3707.02s)]
*  Let's go right here. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3710.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3712.02s)]
*  So, well... [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3714.02s)]
*  I'm talking about all these different issues. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3716.02s)]
*  I'm going to head to another issue [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3722.02s)]
*  which I find particularly interesting. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3723.02s)]
*  You're widely considered a champagne socialist [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3725.5s)]
*  at the School of Arts. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3728.5s)]
*  And I saw that you were traveling here [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3730.5s)]
*  in first class when you came here. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3732.5s)]
*  I mean, personally, [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3734.5s)]
*  I've never gone to the first class. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3736.5s)]
*  I hope you had a comfortable travel. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3738.5s)]
*  But I still think it's an issue we're pointing out [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3740.5s)]
*  because when it comes to, [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3746.5s)]
*  especially the consumption of luxury goods, [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3749.5s)]
*  sports cars, million dollar property, [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3751.5s)]
*  how can you justify yourself as a moral character [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3754.98s)]
*  on the left when you are benefiting [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3758.98s)]
*  more than many capitalists are [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3761.98s)]
*  from what you're doing as being a consumer, [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3764.98s)]
*  exploiting all those consumers' consumer rights and contents, [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3767.98s)]
*  which you are, which is a wide-open search fact. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3770.98s)]
*  They're socially necessary at the time, [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3773.98s)]
*  considering what you are, [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3776.98s)]
*  you could gain that much effort as all those consumers [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3778.98s)]
*  that you're engaged in reacting to. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3780.98s)]
*  And furthermore, [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3783.46s)]
*  when it comes to the consumption of luxury goods, [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3785.46s)]
*  what do you think they would say [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3790.46s)]
*  about this brand of socialism that you represent? [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3795.46s)]
*  Which is, by any measure, [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3799.46s)]
*  I think we're asking the same question. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3801.46s)]
*  I think that you are, [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3803.46s)]
*  I think that you are, [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3806.46s)]
*  I think that you are, [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3808.46s)]
*  you are still the real societal change [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3810.94s)]
*  because you are no more than a material. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3813.94s)]
*  You're a side character. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3816.94s)]
*  Okay. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3818.94s)]
*  Thank you for the question. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3819.94s)]
*  I don't know how familiar you are with Karl Marx, [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3821.94s)]
*  but his bestie literally had a factory, [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3826.94s)]
*  so I don't think that he had that much issue [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3829.94s)]
*  with people that came from means, [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3834.94s)]
*  but having said that, however, [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3840.42s)]
*  I do think that it's a good point. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3842.42s)]
*  What you rise is the point that you brought up [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3844.42s)]
*  that socialism is about being in a poverty cult [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3848.42s)]
*  or living an ascetic lifestyle [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3853.42s)]
*  is, I think, pure reactionary garbage. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3856.42s)]
*  The entire purpose of socialist movements [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3859.42s)]
*  is to allow people to have their own individual freedoms, [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3863.42s)]
*  to have autonomy in their lives, [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3866.42s)]
*  to be able to have some semblance of workplace democracy [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3868.9s)]
*  so they can experience these freedoms [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3871.9s)]
*  and feel like a fucking human being. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3873.9s)]
*  And that is what I practice, [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3875.9s)]
*  and that is what I preach as well. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3878.9s)]
*  I have a cooperative, [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3880.9s)]
*  in the way that I have my own podcast, [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3883.9s)]
*  is equal say, equal pay. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3885.9s)]
*  My producer, Marge, is sitting right there. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3887.9s)]
*  Makes a lot more money than the average Twitch streamer does, [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3889.9s)]
*  as a matter of fact, for that reason. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3893.9s)]
*  And I'm a truly fortunate person. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3895.9s)]
*  I'm truly fortunate for being able to find such success [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3898.38s)]
*  in this field. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3905.38s)]
*  As far as the accusations of exploitation [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3906.38s)]
*  outside of participating in capitalism, [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3912.38s)]
*  which is impossible to avoid, [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3916.38s)]
*  unless you go and, I guess, live in the woods [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3918.38s)]
*  and make your own acts and cut the trees down [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3920.38s)]
*  and build a home for yourself that way, [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3923.38s)]
*  it's impossible to avoid capitalism. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3925.38s)]
*  That's why most socialists will say [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3927.86s)]
*  that there's no ethical consumption. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3928.86s)]
*  As far as my glamorous lifestyle goes, [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3930.86s)]
*  these are voluntary subscriptions [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3936.86s)]
*  that people choose to sign on for. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3938.86s)]
*  I've told people time and time again [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3942.86s)]
*  that they do not have to subscribe to me, [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3944.86s)]
*  but if they want to, they can. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3946.86s)]
*  Back in the day, it was to avoid the top of the hour ad break. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3947.86s)]
*  I don't even serve ads anymore, [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3952.86s)]
*  and I do a decent amount of fundraising on top of that, [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3955.34s)]
*  even though I don't think that philanthropy is socialism. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3958.34s)]
*  I don't think that it works that way. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3963.34s)]
*  And I work with labor movements in general. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3965.34s)]
*  I'd say that someone of my level of wealth [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3968.34s)]
*  or my level of means is perfectly valid [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3973.34s)]
*  and perfectly appropriate. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3976.34s)]
*  You might consider that to be self-serving, [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3977.34s)]
*  but I don't, and it's never been something [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3980.34s)]
*  that is inconsistent. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3982.34s)]
*  When I was broke, I advocated for the same exact things [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3983.82s)]
*  that I advocate for now, and people would say, [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3986.82s)]
*  you're just jealous of the wealthy. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3988.82s)]
*  Now that I do have money, people say you're a hypocrite. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3990.82s)]
*  And I don't know what the expectation is [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3994.82s)]
*  for someone like myself to just cast aside. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=3996.82s)]
*  Once I got a little bit of money, [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4002.82s)]
*  the socialism shit is over. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4003.82s)]
*  You want me to become a right-wing Ben Shapiro type of person? [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4005.82s)]
*  You want me to cast aside my values and my principles? [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4009.82s)]
*  No, I'm not gonna do that. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4013.3s)]
*  So I'm very fortunate, and I try to use all of that fortune [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4015.3s)]
*  for good and to continue uplifting voices that are unheard [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4018.3s)]
*  and to continue to advocate for people [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4022.3s)]
*  to get that same level of emancipation and autonomy [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4024.3s)]
*  in their workplaces and across the board. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4029.3s)]
*  It's no different than my advocacy for, [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4032.3s)]
*  against police brutality. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4037.3s)]
*  I'm not black, but I speak on black issues. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4039.3s)]
*  I'm not trans, but I speak against transphobia. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4042.78s)]
*  And I am not any longer broke, [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4047.78s)]
*  but it doesn't change that dynamic for me even a little bit. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4050.78s)]
*  I think that I'm still going to continue doing that, [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4053.78s)]
*  regardless of the home that I purchased for myself. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4057.78s)]
*  It's not my fault that the California housing market [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4061.78s)]
*  is dog shit. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4063.78s)]
*  I purchased a house for myself that my family can live in. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4065.78s)]
*  That's a pretty valid thing. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4068.78s)]
*  That's a pretty normal thing. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4069.78s)]
*  I think that's something that everyone should be able to do, [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4071.26s)]
*  should be able to get. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4074.26s)]
*  Now, if I were to say, well, I own a home now, [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4075.26s)]
*  so I think the housing market is good. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4079.26s)]
*  We shouldn't do any public housing. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4081.26s)]
*  We shouldn't claw back housing prices. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4083.26s)]
*  Then yeah, that would be inconsistent. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4086.26s)]
*  That would be hypocritical. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4088.26s)]
*  I guess it would be more consistent [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4089.26s)]
*  in the way that you interpret who I am [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4090.26s)]
*  and what I should be, what values I should be presenting. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4092.26s)]
*  But I think that that would be true hypocrisy. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4095.26s)]
*  And as far as the luxury car goes, [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4098.74s)]
*  I leased a dentist car, an EV, just so everybody knows. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4100.74s)]
*  I'm going back to a Toyota. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4104.74s)]
*  Don't worry. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4107.74s)]
*  So I can get my socialist bona fides. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4109.74s)]
*  But yeah. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4111.74s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4113.74s)]
*  That is, Sandy, all we've got time for. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4114.74s)]
*  I'm going to say a couple of other things in seconds. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4116.74s)]
*  But first of all, let's all say one thank you to Hassan. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4118.74s)]
*  APPLAUSE [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4121.74s)]
*  APPLAUSE [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4128.74s)]
*  So for those of you in the room, tomorrow we [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4141.74s)]
*  will have our final debate of the term on the motion [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4143.74s)]
*  this house believes the West is hypocritical towards China. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4145.74s)]
*  For those of you watching online, [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4148.74s)]
*  we are the Cambridge Union. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4150.74s)]
*  Find us on Instagram and YouTube for so much more. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4151.74s)]
*  It's great. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4154.74s)]
*  For those of you who have signed up for the meet and greet, [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4157.219999999999s)]
*  that will be upstairs in the library. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4159.219999999999s)]
*  You will have got an email. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4161.219999999999s)]
*  There is only people who have got the email can come in, [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4162.219999999999s)]
*  so please don't come along unless you have received that. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4164.219999999999s)]
*  There was a ballot on our story. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4166.219999999999s)]
*  So if you just remain seated, that means Hassan leaves the chamber. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4168.219999999999s)]
*  And if you are in the meet and greet, then come upstairs. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4171.219999999999s)]
*  Thank you so much for coming. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4174.219999999999s)]
*  APPLAUSE [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4176.219999999999s)]
*  Thank you for having me, guys. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4178.219999999999s)]
*  APPLAUSE [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4180.219999999999s)]
*  I will join you shortly. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4187.219999999999s)]
*  OK. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4189.219999999999s)]
*  Should I take this mic off? [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4191.219999999999s)]
*  We can do it upstairs. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4193.219999999999s)]
*  So if you want to, you can just go back to the room [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4195.219999999999s)]
*  before, take a minute, while they set up everything. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4197.219999999999s)]
*  Meet and greet and then... [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4199.219999999999s)]
*  How did that go? Is that good? [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4201.219999999999s)]
*  I thought that was really good. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4203.219999999999s)]
*  Expected? [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4205.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, there were lots of challenging questions. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4207.219999999999s)]
*  Oh, no, that's nowhere near as bad as I thought it was going to be. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4209.219999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4211.219999999999s)]
*  I suppose we should go. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4213.219999999999s)]
*  I'm so sorry, Hassan. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4215.7s)]
*  Mind if I take a second? [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4217.7s)]
*  I didn't get through a ballot. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4219.7s)]
*  Would you mind signing a book for me? [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4221.7s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4223.7s)]
*  Thanks so much, man. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4225.7s)]
*  I'll get the... [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4227.7s)]
*  I'm much appreciated for your advocacy. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4229.7s)]
*  Oh, hell yeah, thank you. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4231.7s)]
*  Thank you for watching. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4233.7s)]
*  I also have a question. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4235.7s)]
*  Galatasaray, please. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4237.7s)]
*  Oh, my God. My dad would kill me. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4239.7s)]
*  We're a fan of Arbace family. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4241.7s)]
*  Nice to meet you, man. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4244.179999999999s)]
*  I'm Karel, by the way. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4246.179999999999s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4248.179999999999s)]
*  Great to have you here. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4250.179999999999s)]
*  Quick question. First of all, thanks for coming. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4252.179999999999s)]
*  Oh, of course. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4254.179999999999s)]
*  Second of all, do you feel that as your platform grows, [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4256.179999999999s)]
*  this manner in which you have to communicate your topics and what topics you choose changes? [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4258.179999999999s)]
*  How does that go along with the evolution and growth of platforms like Twitch going forward? [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4264.179999999999s)]
*  No, I mean, it might be the case for other people. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4270.179999999999s)]
*  No, I've maintained the same exact decisions and have the same fire and same heat for it for years now. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4272.66s)]
*  You can go back and watch, like, I don't know, things that I've talked about 10 years ago, [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4282.66s)]
*  8 years ago, 9 years ago, and you'll see it's identical. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4288.66s)]
*  Oftentimes, that's what makes my commentary a little bit easier, I think. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4292.66s)]
*  I run by 15 minutes. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4296.66s)]
*  Because in many instances, given the problems are unchanging... [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4298.66s)]
*  Yeah, and you've got the... [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4301.139999999999s)]
*  In many instances, I've found myself repeating the same exact things, [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4303.139999999999s)]
*  the same exact statements in general. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4307.139999999999s)]
*  What's up? [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4309.139999999999s)]
*  Just hold him here. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4311.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, no problem. Nice to meet you. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4313.139999999999s)]
*  Where is it happening? Here? [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4321.139999999999s)]
*  Should we just go over there? [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4323.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, if that's alright. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4325.139999999999s)]
*  I think the stuff's already in there. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4327.139999999999s)]
*  I think people really liked it on... [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4329.62s)]
*  I mean, I haven't seen my chat. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4331.62s)]
*  Oh, they loved it. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4333.62s)]
*  They did? Alright, good. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4335.62s)]
*  I'm glad, I'm glad. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4337.62s)]
*  I don't know why people think that when they... [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4339.62s)]
*  In real life, if they treat it like a gray name that they're going to come across sound and confident, [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4341.62s)]
*  I don't think they understand that. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4347.62s)]
*  In their head, I think in many instances, people in their minds, they're like, oh yeah, this is going to be my pop-off moment. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4349.62s)]
*  But then, in practice, when you're in person against someone, especially someone on a podium, [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4356.099999999999s)]
*  it's very intimidating. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4362.099999999999s)]
*  And that's why they come across as kind of silly. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4364.099999999999s)]
*  I'm going to go and grab the tripod really quick, okay? [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4368.099999999999s)]
*  Would you say that Ben Shapiro got more naysayers or I did? [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4370.099999999999s)]
*  Oh, I think he got more naysayers. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4374.099999999999s)]
*  Well, he did a bit differently. We got people to actually come up and debate against him. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4376.099999999999s)]
*  I saw you reading the people from a certain community, planning their... [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4380.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, and it did happen, but I think it's silly overall. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4384.58s)]
*  I don't know why they thought it would go down differently than it actually did. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4388.58s)]
*  I feel it went down well. There were a good balance of people. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4392.58s)]
*  Yeah, it would have been boring if everyone was glazing. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4394.58s)]
*  The last few questions were just... [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4396.58s)]
*  I didn't want to end on George Galloway. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4398.58s)]
*  That wasn't a question. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4400.58s)]
*  I didn't want to end on the George Galloway mention. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4402.58s)]
*  Actually, I have a question though. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4404.58s)]
*  What's up? [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4406.58s)]
*  Why do you think so many former Young Tucks ended up joining the Ricks after a while? [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4408.58s)]
*  Oh my god, I don't know. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4410.58s)]
*  If only I knew, trust me. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4413.0599999999995s)]
*  It's become a breeding ground for the Jimmy Doors of the world. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4415.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I think people... [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4423.0599999999995s)]
*  I mean, I've had this conversation with Cenk as well on Cenk's Giving. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4425.0599999999995s)]
*  It's just like, I think it comes from hopelessness. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4429.0599999999995s)]
*  Where people just look at the situation and they're like, [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4431.0599999999995s)]
*  nothing's changing, you know what I mean? [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4433.0599999999995s)]
*  So then in their minds, I think they're like, [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4435.0599999999995s)]
*  well, let's just let it go. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4437.0599999999995s)]
*  I think it's just like, [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4439.0599999999995s)]
*  well, let's just stop the bleeding. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4441.54s)]
*  And the quickest solution always is going to be [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4443.54s)]
*  right-wing reactionary solutions to ongoing problems. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4447.54s)]
*  It's much harder to solve poverty, [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4451.54s)]
*  intergenerational poverty, than it is to simply say, [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4453.54s)]
*  yeah, we've got to lean into the crime panic and we have to do something about criminals. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4455.54s)]
*  They're going crazy. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4459.54s)]
*  So do you think it's more for right-wing groups or do they genuinely change their positions? [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4461.54s)]
*  I think they genuinely have changed their positions. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4465.54s)]
*  I think, which is kind of sadder, I guess. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4467.54s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4470.0199999999995s)]
*  But yeah, on some issues I think they have. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4472.0199999999995s)]
*  They have changed their positions. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4474.0199999999995s)]
*  That's very interesting. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4476.0199999999995s)]
*  I've been watching the Young Coops for a decade, I think. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4478.0199999999995s)]
*  Seeing so many people in the youth group. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4480.0199999999995s)]
*  Well, there's the regular group, there's like Dave Rubin. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4482.0199999999995s)]
*  He was never really all that invested. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4484.0199999999995s)]
*  He was just like a media person, right? [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4486.0199999999995s)]
*  He didn't care. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4488.0199999999995s)]
*  Whatever buttered his bread, he was going to go in that direction, no matter what. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4490.0199999999995s)]
*  So that one makes sense. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4494.0199999999995s)]
*  And then there is the other group, [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4496.0199999999995s)]
*  which makes sense. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4498.5s)]
*  And then there's the cranks that I think start leaning into the crank side of things. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4500.5s)]
*  And they're so invested in being anti-establishment that they end up championing the right. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4504.5s)]
*  Which is weird because it's like you're not outside of the orbit of politics. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4510.5s)]
*  You're literally just a right-winger now. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4516.5s)]
*  Which is the most establishment. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4518.5s)]
*  It's the most successful out of the two. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4520.5s)]
*  It's more successful out of the two parties. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4522.5s)]
*  The fuck? [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4524.5s)]
*  That's another thing that occurs. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4526.98s)]
*  Great. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4528.98s)]
*  Thanks so much, I don't want to disturb you. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4530.98s)]
*  No problem. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4532.98s)]
*  Your parents are going to go get food. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4534.98s)]
*  Okay, good. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4536.98s)]
*  Chad, did you like it? [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4538.98s)]
*  Brother, the food in this room is going incredibly hard. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4544.98s)]
*  It's just like how British people eat it. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4546.98s)]
*  This is how it is. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4550.98s)]
*  It's a pre-fum. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4552.98s)]
*  Will Mark call that a Cambridge house? [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4555.459999999999s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4563.459999999999s)]
*  I watch you every day. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4565.459999999999s)]
*  Ever since the electric cycle started. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4567.459999999999s)]
*  Where did you get your information on? [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4581.459999999999s)]
*  I mean, I think as far as predictions go, I'm not interpreting events or rehashing what any legacy publisher is saying or any commentator is saying. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4583.94s)]
*  It's more so I'm looking at it from the lens of materialist analysis and judging it by party track record and what has happened in the past. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4599.94s)]
*  And I think that's where it comes from. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4607.94s)]
*  But there's still plenty I get wrong. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4609.94s)]
*  I still thought that while the Harris campaign was taking on a dangerous gamble, I still said that there is a chance that she could eke out a marginal victory in the electoral college while still losing the popular vote to Donald Trump. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4612.419999999999s)]
*  And she lost. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4626.419999999999s)]
*  I thought that the blue wall would potentially hold and it didn't. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4628.419999999999s)]
*  So, you know, I'm not always on the money. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4632.419999999999s)]
*  I try my best though. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4636.419999999999s)]
*  Is it being live streamed? [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4638.419999999999s)]
*  What? [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4640.9s)]
*  Oh, no, I don't run the outbreaks anymore. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4642.9s)]
*  So, well, yeah, nice to meet you, man. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4644.9s)]
*  Thank you for coming. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4647.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4649.9s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4663.9s)]
*  No problem. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4664.9s)]
*  What's up, man? [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4666.9s)]
*  I got a question I didn't get to ask. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4667.9s)]
*  All right. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4668.9s)]
*  This is a sick jagged. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4670.379999999999s)]
*  What's going on here? [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4671.379999999999s)]
*  Oh, nice. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4672.379999999999s)]
*  OK. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4673.379999999999s)]
*  So two weeks ago, Slavoj Zizek was up to it. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4674.379999999999s)]
*  And he spoke about similar to what you're talking about with the Western, like nationalist and authoritarian parties increasingly coming to power. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4676.379999999999s)]
*  He pointed out that one kind of side effect that comes with this is the political class and the media, but also the public arise of shamelessness. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4684.379999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4694.379999999999s)]
*  So he proposed that we need an increased shamefulness in how we operate and conduct and act with each other. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4696.86s)]
*  Like shame others? [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4702.86s)]
*  Or does he mean like we have to be shameful? [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4703.86s)]
*  So everyone, the political class media, but the public as well, needs an increased sense of shamefulness as a society to continue functioning. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4705.86s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4712.86s)]
*  What were your thoughts on that? [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4713.86s)]
*  I mean, I think Slavoj needs to exercise a little bit of shame himself. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4714.86s)]
*  But yeah, I don't know. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4719.86s)]
*  I mean, it's an interesting theory. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4721.86s)]
*  It seems patently anti-materialist. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4724.339999999999s)]
*  So he's very materialist. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4729.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah. So I don't know where he's coming from with that. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4731.339999999999s)]
*  But he said a lot of stuff that I don't fully agree with as of late. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4733.339999999999s)]
*  So who knows? [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4737.339999999999s)]
*  But I mean, I think his old words are they stand for themselves. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4738.339999999999s)]
*  They're good. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4741.339999999999s)]
*  What do you think of Norman Fincherson? [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4742.339999999999s)]
*  I love Norm. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4744.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he's the goat. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4745.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4746.339999999999s)]
*  Norm is, with the exception, I think, like anything outside of his chronicling of [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4747.82s)]
*  of Gazan history and the Palestinian struggle and Palestinian oppression, [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4755.34s)]
*  everything outside of that I often will not pay a lot of attention to, whether it's like social issues or whatever. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4758.34s)]
*  I mean, he's a boomer. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4765.34s)]
*  He has a landline still, you know? [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4766.34s)]
*  So I don't think he's like going to understand trans people. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4769.34s)]
*  Like, I just don't think that that's not my expectation. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4773.34s)]
*  But he is probably one of the most vindicated men in American academia at this point, [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4777.34s)]
*  because virtually every single thing that he has been championing for many, many years has now become almost commonly held opinions. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4783.34s)]
*  And yeah, I mean, I think he is a fantastic academic. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4793.34s)]
*  He is a very stubborn man. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4801.34s)]
*  I really appreciate that. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4803.34s)]
*  I think I'm a stubborn guy as well. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4804.34s)]
*  And, you know, I hope to be as... [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4806.34s)]
*  I hope to have an impact as important as his one day, maybe. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4810.34s)]
*  Cheers, man. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4814.34s)]
*  Can I get a picture with you? [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4815.34s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4816.34s)]
*  Cheers. Thank you. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4817.34s)]
*  You want one, David? [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4818.34s)]
*  Cheers. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4819.34s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4820.34s)]
*  Cheers. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4821.34s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4822.34s)]
*  Cheers. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4823.34s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4824.34s)]
*  Alright. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4830.34s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4834.34s)]
*  Cheers. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4835.34s)]
*  What's going on? [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4837.34s)]
*  I also have a question. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4838.34s)]
*  Alright, let's hear it. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4839.34s)]
*  It is like 500 years old. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4840.34s)]
*  Do you think, congrats on your recent CNN appearance. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4843.34s)]
*  Do you... [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4847.34s)]
*  I don't know if it's worthy of congratulations, but it's like, do you ever feel like you have to compromise on your values in terms of how vocally and how brightly you discuss certain topics [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4848.34s)]
*  in order to get the opportunity to speak on more mainstream platforms? [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4861.34s)]
*  Or do you feel that it's more important to stay true to your values in terms of how you talk about your message on particularly more... [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4865.34s)]
*  I think I always stay true to my values, but I also value the importance of reading the room. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4873.34s)]
*  And not everything has to be almost hysterical, you know what I mean? [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4882.34s)]
*  I try to moderate my perspective with the full knowledge of the audience that is receiving it. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4889.34s)]
*  And I think that's a really... [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4896.34s)]
*  I mean, I urge others to do that as well, to put their best foot forward to the best of their ability and maybe not even get emotional, you know? [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4898.34s)]
*  And it's just, you know, I definitely... [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4907.34s)]
*  I wouldn't say I moderate my perspective, but I definitely try to be... [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4911.34s)]
*  Wait, Marge. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4915.34s)]
*  Yeah? [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4916.34s)]
*  You can film this. We're talking politics. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4917.34s)]
*  Oh, I was just showing chat the room. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4919.34s)]
*  Yeah. But yeah, I try to moderate my position, never compromising on my values, but I try to moderate it because I'm aware of the audience that I think is receiving it, if that makes sense. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4921.34s)]
*  Great speech. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4934.34s)]
*  Yeah, of course. Yeah, nice to meet you. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4935.34s)]
*  Are you leaving for the UK? [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4937.34s)]
*  No. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4938.34s)]
*  We've got five more years before I get fired. It's on you guys. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4939.34s)]
*  Yeah, but that... but also the weather is ass. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4941.34s)]
*  It's depressing. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4944.34s)]
*  The weather's ass, the sun sets at 3pm. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4945.34s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4949.34s)]
*  It makes no sense. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4950.34s)]
*  I can't tell you what I'm doing. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4956.34s)]
*  What were you doing? [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4957.34s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4958.34s)]
*  Cheers. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4961.34s)]
*  Alright, no problem. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4962.34s)]
*  Yeah, it's my answer. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4963.34s)]
*  Hi. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4965.34s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4966.34s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4967.34s)]
*  I've been watching this since 2019. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4968.34s)]
*  Oh, hell yeah. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4970.34s)]
*  I used to watch it when I was waiting at the hospital. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4971.34s)]
*  So, it was really helpful listening to you and that you've been a voice for the whole [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4974.34s)]
*  of the game politics, especially because everything seems really right and clean. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4979.34s)]
*  But although when I do watch your streams on YouTube, I do get recommendations for the [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4983.34s)]
*  bench bureau, so that's really lovely. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4988.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4990.34s)]
*  The right wing is... the right wing floods the market with a lot of junk. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4991.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4995.34s)]
*  So, it's hard to overcome that. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4996.34s)]
*  And I think YouTube, whether they're aware of it or not, I don't know, but they definitely [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=4998.34s)]
*  do facilitate this unlimited, unrestricted amount of right wing content on the platform. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5004.34s)]
*  That's why I kind of use your streams like a buffer zone when I watch their videos, [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5010.34s)]
*  so it's actually better for me. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5015.34s)]
*  Yeah, that's the other thing, yeah, because I do routinely criticize Ben Shapiro and the [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5017.34s)]
*  likes, so that's probably the other reason why the algorithm picks it up. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5021.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5024.34s)]
*  You want to take a photo? [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5025.34s)]
*  All right, let's do it. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5027.34s)]
*  Okay, got a few. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5043.34s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5044.34s)]
*  Okay. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5045.34s)]
*  Really nice to meet you. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5046.34s)]
*  Nice to meet you as well. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5047.34s)]
*  I think I can just ask you a question. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5048.34s)]
*  What's up? [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5050.34s)]
*  How optimistic are you that the Democratic Party will ever race left-leaning? [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5051.34s)]
*  I think if I know anything about Hassan, he would like everybody at least get a chance [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5055.34s)]
*  to get a picture or something. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5059.34s)]
*  I don't. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5061.34s)]
*  I'm not. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5062.34s)]
*  I'm not optimistic. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5063.34s)]
*  I think that's never going to happen unless there's genuine pressure. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5064.34s)]
*  Do the whole line. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5067.34s)]
*  Genuine pressure from the likes of the UAW, for example. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5069.34s)]
*  The Democratic Party relies on certain institutions like unions, still, to drive turnout, uses [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5074.34s)]
*  that to get people to go out and vote. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5082.34s)]
*  And if left to their own devices, they'll just keep losing. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5085.34s)]
*  They're perfectly fine being graceful losers and fundraising off of the horrifying things [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5089.34s)]
*  the Republican Party does. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5095.34s)]
*  So I think that there needs to be a more solid network, a mechanism of pressure that will [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5097.34s)]
*  force the Democratic Party to concede. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5102.34s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5105.34s)]
*  The voices. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5108.34s)]
*  Mark, can we see the roof? [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5113.34s)]
*  Okay, just really quickly. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5115.34s)]
*  Awesome, thank you. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5116.34s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5117.34s)]
*  Nice meeting you. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5118.34s)]
*  What's up? [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5119.34s)]
*  Hi, thank you for the talk. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5120.34s)]
*  I really enjoyed it. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5121.34s)]
*  Oh, nice to meet you. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5122.34s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5123.34s)]
*  Thank you for watching. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5124.34s)]
*  So one question I have is, well, I feel like most of arguments about Palestine, especially [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5125.34s)]
*  not only about the current conflict but the sort of broader situation, focus on things [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5131.34s)]
*  like colonialism or comparisons to white supremacy. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5136.34s)]
*  And I personally come from Poland where I feel like these topics aren't really taken [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5140.34s)]
*  very seriously. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5148.34s)]
*  I mean, like the most sort of connection with imperialism might be old communist propaganda [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5149.34s)]
*  or stuff like that. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5156.34s)]
*  So how do you think the arguments could be adapted to work better in such environments? [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5158.34s)]
*  Oh, that's a really good question. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5165.34s)]
*  I guess maybe you could point to the Nazis. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5167.34s)]
*  That's one aspect that you could point back to. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5173.34s)]
*  I don't really know how Poland sees Israel. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5178.34s)]
*  Like, I don't know what the dynamic is there at all. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5181.34s)]
*  But yeah, I rarely use academic language describing the atrocities that are unfolding in Gaza. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5185.34s)]
*  So I don't think there is a reason to talk about imperialism of that sort. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5193.34s)]
*  I mean, I do consider Israel to be a settler colonial entity, which it is. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5198.34s)]
*  But overall, I think it's a much simpler argument that you can present where you're like, [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5202.34s)]
*  these guys are just killing a shit ton of Palestinians. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5207.34s)]
*  And they're doing it with the full unconditional support of the West. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5210.34s)]
*  And in countries like mine, for example, the simplest argument that I see have a tremendous [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5214.34s)]
*  amount of success is your roads are fucked. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5221.34s)]
*  We have potholes. Our Internet sucks. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5225.34s)]
*  Nothing is good. Housing is impossible to obtain. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5228.34s)]
*  And we have natural disasters. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5232.34s)]
*  And then our congresspersons are giving $18 billion to Israel so they can continue baby murder. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5235.34s)]
*  And it's like, that's ridiculous. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5240.34s)]
*  Most Americans, regardless of their background, look at that and go, what the fuck? [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5243.34s)]
*  That doesn't make any sense. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5246.34s)]
*  So I think that's something that you can present as an argument as well, [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5248.34s)]
*  which is that, like, why are they doing that? [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5251.34s)]
*  Like, why? This is like untenable. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5254.34s)]
*  It's destabilizing and it's unfair and unjust. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5256.34s)]
*  So I think that's probably a better way to communicate that than talking about imperialism or white supremacy. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5260.34s)]
*  Especially because, like, Israel is... [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5269.34s)]
*  I mean, there is white supremacy there, [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5273.34s)]
*  but whiteness in that regard is something totally different than, like, the black-white dynamic in America. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5275.34s)]
*  Because most Israeli Jews are Mizrahi and Sephardi. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5280.34s)]
*  And those guys don't look any different than the non-Jewish Arabs that live in the region. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5285.34s)]
*  You know? They look the same. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5290.34s)]
*  So it's not exactly whiteness in general. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5292.34s)]
*  Even the likes of Itamar Ben-Ghivir. I mean, he's Iraqi. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5295.34s)]
*  You know, he's from Iraq. He looks like an Arab uncle. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5298.34s)]
*  Because he is. He is Arab. He's Arab and Kurdish. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5302.34s)]
*  So it's too complex for people to understand. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5304.34s)]
*  Because then you'd have to describe whiteness as, like, proximity to power and all this stuff. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5308.34s)]
*  So you don't need to engage with it in that regard. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5312.34s)]
*  I hope that was helpful. I don't know. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5317.34s)]
*  Thank you. Thanks. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5319.34s)]
*  If you're curious, Polish Socialist Party. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5320.34s)]
*  Oh, okay. How many people does the PPS have? [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5322.34s)]
*  I don't know enough about Polish politics. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5326.34s)]
*  Currently we are in the government, though, a small part. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5329.34s)]
*  But we're coming back. Don't worry. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5334.34s)]
*  Okay. All right. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5337.34s)]
*  Thanks. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5352.34s)]
*  All right. Nice to meet you. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5353.34s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5354.34s)]
*  What's up? [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5355.34s)]
*  I'm Riyadh. I'm from India. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5356.34s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5357.34s)]
*  I have a question. I have a question that right now that right wing is at par. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5358.34s)]
*  And across the globe, the right wing is comparatively ruling the major, major of the countries. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5365.34s)]
*  How you see that as you are a left wing oriented people. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5370.34s)]
*  So how you can comparatively defend the right of the left wing people or the minority on that. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5374.34s)]
*  Because in my country, it's also happening in India right now. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5379.34s)]
*  Right wing ruling in India and the religious minority like Muslims are prosecuted. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5383.34s)]
*  Become political prisoners and we are not have a right to speak freely, right? [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5390.34s)]
*  Something like that. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5395.34s)]
*  So how you suggest to... [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5396.34s)]
*  Yeah, that's tough. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5398.34s)]
*  You just got to keep organizing no matter what and have a network that you can rely on when the time comes. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5401.34s)]
*  Because there's like not really much you can do if we're going full tilt fascism. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5409.34s)]
*  Then the only people you can rely on are your neighbors in that regard. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5413.34s)]
*  And have a network of organizations that you can go back to, to engage in some semblance of community defense. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5416.34s)]
*  So that's what it is. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5423.34s)]
*  Outside of that, you just keep trying to utilize the available legal avenues that exist to continue advocacy. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5425.34s)]
*  And to continue fighting for human rights in the process. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5432.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5439.34s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5454.34s)]
*  Hi. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5455.34s)]
*  Hi. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5456.34s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5457.34s)]
*  Do you have any of the tickets? [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5458.34s)]
*  Okay. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5460.34s)]
*  It's all good. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5461.34s)]
*  You want to take a photo? [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5462.34s)]
*  All right. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5463.34s)]
*  Let's do it. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5464.34s)]
*  Thanks for your time. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5468.34s)]
*  Thanks for your time. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5469.34s)]
*  Nice meeting you. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5470.34s)]
*  Hi. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5471.34s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5472.34s)]
*  Nice to meet you as well. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5473.34s)]
*  I'm Brigida. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5474.34s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5475.34s)]
*  I grew up in Chicago, so I was kind of wanting to talk to you about the DNC. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5476.34s)]
*  Okay. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5477.34s)]
*  The NERV, the NERV experience there this summer. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5478.34s)]
*  Because I had this feeling like when I was there that there was this weird dichotomy of [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5479.34s)]
*  the Democrats going really right-wing on some like military issues, immigration, and then [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5480.34s)]
*  simultaneously, like popping up like in the middle of the country. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5481.34s)]
*  And then they were just like, oh, I want to go to the DNC. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5482.34s)]
*  So I'm like, oh, I want to go to the DNC. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5483.34s)]
*  So I'm like, oh, I want to go to the DNC. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5484.34s)]
*  And I don't know, I heard that you got kicked out on the last day, right? [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5485.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5507.18s)]
*  Well, I think it fully kicked out. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5508.18s)]
*  They just made it so that it was impossible to stream. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5509.18s)]
*  But that's it. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5512.18s)]
*  It was a very polite DNC. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5513.18s)]
*  It was a very polite way to kick me out. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5516.02s)]
*  I still appreciated the time I had there. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5517.02s)]
*  But what was the question? [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5522.02s)]
*  No, just overall, your opinion on the direction of the DNC as a convention. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5523.02s)]
*  I mean, they went super right-wing. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5528.22s)]
*  They had cops, border patrol guards, people like that on stage. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5530.820000000001s)]
*  Who they didn't allow space inside of that tent also matters, like Palestinian Americans, [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5535.860000000001s)]
*  even though they're Democratic Party delegates, trans people, just like advocates and activists [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5542.06s)]
*  of many different backgrounds that normally make up a big part of the constituencies of [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5549.22s)]
*  the Democratic Party. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5556.9400000000005s)]
*  Like they were not afforded the same speaking time. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5557.9400000000005s)]
*  And I think they just, I mean, that's the reason why they lost. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5560.5s)]
*  They went into a treacherous territory in right-wing politics. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5563.46s)]
*  And they knew that they were always going to get dominated in that space. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5570.66s)]
*  But I guess they didn't think about it clearly. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5572.86s)]
*  They thought this is a successful method to win over voters. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5574.66s)]
*  I guess where I struggle a little bit with leftist politics in the States, though, is [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5578.66s)]
*  that I think Jill Stein is a grifter. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5583.66s)]
*  I think she is literally a bot for Russia. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5585.66s)]
*  And I see this really difficult path forward to be anywhere but try to make the Democratic [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5588.66s)]
*  Party better. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5595.66s)]
*  I mean, I agree with that for the most part, yeah. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5596.66s)]
*  I think that that is what's the only way out of this. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5599.86s)]
*  Other than that, it's just like a complete collapse of the uniparty approach that we [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5603.86s)]
*  have and then who knows what happens after that. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5608.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5611.139999999999s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5612.139999999999s)]
*  Thanks for speaking. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5613.139999999999s)]
*  I'm sure you're quite tired. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5614.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5615.139999999999s)]
*  No, it's all good. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5616.139999999999s)]
*  Hi. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5617.14s)]
*  Hi. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5618.14s)]
*  Hassan. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5619.14s)]
*  I've been a fan for ages. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5620.14s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5621.14s)]
*  I had a question. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5622.14s)]
*  Looking at the UK specifically, kind of the future of the progressive left, like if we're [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5623.14s)]
*  thinking electorally, do you think it would be worth trying to push the Labour Party to [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5632.14s)]
*  the left? [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5643.14s)]
*  Or do you think now with Corbyn gone, that's kind of never going to happen? [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5644.14s)]
*  Do you think we should look at third party alternatives? [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5649.14s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5652.14s)]
*  Or do you think it's just a very long road that happens? [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5653.14s)]
*  I don't know what a junior coalition partner can do in terms of making demands known. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5658.14s)]
*  The Labour Party will fail on its own, no matter what, if they continue along with the [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5665.14s)]
*  party. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5670.14s)]
*  I think it's important to have a third party option. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5671.14s)]
*  I think it's important to have a third party option. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5674.14s)]
*  I think it's important to have a third party option. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5677.14s)]
*  I think it's important to have a third party option. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5680.14s)]
*  I think it's important to have a third party option. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5683.14s)]
*  I think it's important to have a third party option. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5686.14s)]
*  I think it's important to have a third party option. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5689.14s)]
*  I think it's important to have a third party option. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5692.14s)]
*  I think it's important to have a third party option. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5695.14s)]
*  But overall I think maybe there's an opportunity to apply pressure as a smaller party with [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5698.14s)]
*  coalition building. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5707.14s)]
*  But at least as far as I've seen, I think that Labour is probably more amenable than [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5708.14s)]
*  Macron was, for example, in France. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5716.14s)]
*  So I think there's more opportunity there. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5719.14s)]
*  But ultimately it should still be trying to restore Labour to its former glory, I guess, [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5721.14s)]
*  and not have this right-wing, lighter Tory version of the party that it now is. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5728.14s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5735.14s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5737.14s)]

*  You don't. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5759.14s)]
*  It takes on Hong Kong and China. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5760.14s)]

*  We'll see. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5766.14s)]
*  Only time will tell what Chinese rulership over Hong Kong looks like. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5767.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5768.14s)]
*  The Chinese governance is very oppressive on social media. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5769.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5770.14s)]

*  lot of like [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5942.639999999999s)]
*  That narrative continued and I think people just like never gave it an afterthought [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5944.2s)]
*  They just kind of went along with it without really [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5948.48s)]
*  questioning it and [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5952.2s)]
*  I wonder if people's analysis of that has changed at all, but I don't know. I don't know how like [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5953.719999999999s)]
*  Big the the pro-palestine movement is in England. I feel like I've seen a lot of [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5958.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah like tens of thousands of people and stuff so [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5968.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5980.72s)]
*  But like I think most people actually properly understand who he is [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5983.52s)]
*  Oh [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5987.84s)]
*  It's worse I think British media is worse than American media. Yes. I think American media is stupider like American media is dumber [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5990.52s)]
*  They're they they're more like [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5997.08s)]
*  Invested in like silly conspiracy theories and stuff British media is vicious [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=5999.32s)]
*  Yeah, they're they're pretty scathing and they're pretty vicious like I mean even fucking Piers Morgan I go on a show all the time like [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6006.0s)]
*  He's like didn't you do the paparazzi thing like he like leaked people's like that's vicious that's like really [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6012.56s)]
*  I don't either [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6021.92s)]
*  It's hard. That's why I do it sparingly. I don't do it all the time [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6024.24s)]

*  You weren't harder than me is that what you're looking at yeah, you are just to get a screenshot from the camera [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6075.08s)]
*  Do you ball a little I start like this term? Oh, you just that's a waste of height man. You gotta start ballin [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6080.32s)]
*  Okay, all right nice to meet you as well. Yeah, of course [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6090.28s)]

*  I'm really sorry to bring up something a little bit old, but I have this favorite thing that you said was [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6108.5199999999995s)]
*  I think you said that [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6115.84s)]
*  One piece is Marxist and Luffy's a terrorist. Yeah, I mean it's not it's true still true [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6120.28s)]
*  Absolutely, that was actually what got me interested in what you do and also what got me interested in watching one piece [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6125.44s)]
*  Oh hell yeah [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6131.48s)]
*  Oh hell yeah, okay [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6134.0s)]
*  I mean, I think it's media always plays catch-up with whatever is going on in the real world, right? [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6149.28s)]
*  So I don't place a lot of emphasis on like the power that it has to change [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6155.48s)]
*  I want to say change people's minds because that's kind of what I try to do to the best of my ability but [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6160.84s)]
*  overall even from my own personal experience like when I have seen the most impact is when there are people like Bernie Sanders out there that are [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6166.88s)]
*  Communicating these ideas from the largest podium available and only then do people actually start recognizing the importance of [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6174.72s)]
*  Movements such as like leftist politics. So [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6181.719999999999s)]
*  Overall, I think you know political media is important, but it's always gonna be downstream to material realities and the things that people experience [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6186.36s)]
*  Yeah, he's already snapping while we were talking [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6199.04s)]
*  Thank you so much no problem [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6206.639999999999s)]
*  What's going on? [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6209.24s)]
*  Question it's been a big fan [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6211.44s)]
*  What should I watch the miles like 15 16? Oh, yeah [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6213.44s)]

*  Hello, very nice to meet you. Nice to meet you as well. I've been watching you for years and I think you're doing an incredible job [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6239.48s)]
*  I think that you know you do a very important job, especially because I think the media nowadays is [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6244.48s)]
*  Shifting a lot towards the far right. Yeah, and I think I think you should keep on going and I think you're very very funny [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6249.639999999999s)]
*  and I think my question to you is [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6257.28s)]
*  because I'm trying to [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6260.759999999999s)]
*  I'm trying to take advantage of this attention economy that we live in [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6262.32s)]
*  What do you think is an advice that you could give me how to take advantage and how to maybe build a personal brand? [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6267.08s)]
*  be yourself and also find things that are not immediately political that you're interested in and [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6275.5199999999995s)]
*  And show that you're a multifaceted person. Okay, because I think that [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6281.24s)]
*  Politics will bring you a lot of attention both negative and positive, but overall it's kind of boring and dull [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6286.5599999999995s)]
*  but if you want to [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6294.2s)]
*  If you want to reach a broader audience, you always have to show that you're a normal person with real hobbies and things like that [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6296.5599999999995s)]
*  And that's what I try to do at least [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6301.76s)]
*  And that's what I've seen success in. Thank you very much. And also how's the body transformation had an impact on your [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6304.92s)]
*  Just on your overall streaming and you like pretty good. I mean it's it [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6311.599999999999s)]
*  Creates a lot of mental fortitude. I think like it I'm more confident. I'm happier so I can withstand [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6318.12s)]
*  a sea of attacks and smears and whatnot without really [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6326.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, without really thinking about it at all and it keeps me stable like it keeps me grounded. So it's been great [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6330.2s)]
*  Thank you very much. No problem [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6337.24s)]

*  Someone warned me that the comments were evil. So I thought I'd apologize down the lens of the camera [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6479.8s)]
*  No, no, it is a perfectly valid question. I think I [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6484.04s)]
*  Was just taking she was taking photos so I was trying to pose no, but yeah, I didn't I didn't think anything of it [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6489.96s)]
*  I think like I mean there was way more scathing [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6496.02s)]
*  Yeah, I do I know it's fine it's not a problem [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6501.0s)]
*  I just was wondering like since you're quite successful. I know you've got some [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6504.0s)]
*  Also like in so far as you organically [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6508.400000000001s)]
*  I'm trying to do that. I was just [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6511.72s)]
*  Yeah, get it get it uncle [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6518.04s)]
*  The media company no, I wouldn't I mean that's been definitely very helpful. I've talked about this quite a bit [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6521.68s)]
*  Gives you a major leg up, but I think in the age of take talk like the opportunities are truly endless [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6528.820000000001s)]
*  you know what I mean, I like I [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6535.3s)]
*  would suggest just [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6538.38s)]
*  forcing yourself to do content every single day on take time especially because something is gonna hit and [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6541.34s)]
*  Once it does you're gonna start developing [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6548.66s)]
*  An audience you're gonna develop a brand and you just got to keep doing it over and over again after that [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6551.3s)]
*  And I think like being regimented in that regard is probably the most successful way to to boost your [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6556.18s)]
*  Your brand and to become a brand in general [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6563.5s)]

*  Hi nice to meet you [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6623.0s)]
*  I am a real person [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6625.84s)]
*  No, I'm used to it [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6630.88s)]
*  I think at this point in my heart is just I'm used to it [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6637.2s)]
*  That's what it is. And at first it was like really exciting cuz I'm like, oh my god [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6640.64s)]
*  Someone knows who I am like that's sick and then it just became like a normal thing, you know [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6644.24s)]
*  But yeah, I've been a sociable person my whole life I would say [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6649.54s)]
*  Twitch is ruined that a little bit. It's broken my brain, but you know, I try to do my best [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6654.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6662.0199999999995s)]
*  Well, we saw that earlier today when people wanted to come at me in a very, you know fiery way [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6663.78s)]
*  And I think it plays itself out in like a real personal dynamic in a very different way than it does online if that makes sense [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6670.139999999999s)]
*  Where when you can see the person and you can and you can feel the tension in the room [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6677.120000000001s)]
*  It's a little different. I don't think it favors the people with scathing commentary as much as they think it does [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6683.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think people kind of look more hysterical in that situation [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6691.6s)]
*  Yeah, but it is what it is. You want to take a photo? Yeah. All right, let's do it [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6695.120000000001s)]
*  Boom [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6703.160000000001s)]
*  Oh [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6706.56s)]
*  Nice to meet you [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6712.56s)]
*  Do you guys have questions or you want to take photos as well? All right, let's do it [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6715.240000000001s)]
*  No, no, I mean I'm used to it [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6720.200000000001s)]
*  I guess the thing I was talking a little bit about was you know, I know you're not a fan of I'm not fan of him [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6722.0s)]
*  either, but you know, Richie Torres sent a big letter, but oh god [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6727.660000000001s)]
*  but in particular there were some comments in there about [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6730.6s)]
*  A lot of people did feel very upset at the time I'm seeing about dismissing one October 7th as rape fantasies rape hallucinations [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6733.879999999999s)]
*  I mean UN [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6740.839999999999s)]
*  Has gone checked. Yeah [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6742.759999999999s)]
*  You know, it's ironic you want you want to know is ironic about that [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6745.16s)]
*  so that was a 17 second clip that Richie Torres got from [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6749.36s)]
*  From a group of people that are like, you know trying to present this narrative that I am a vicious anti-semite [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6754.799999999999s)]
*  Is a rape denial denialist and what's really interesting about that clip is that I went back because I was like this doesn't make any sense [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6761.76s)]
*  and I went back and I looked at the 17 second clip that he put in that and [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6768.639999999999s)]
*  It was actually from a broader conversation where I was arguing against someone who was denying race and I was like no [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6772.32s)]
*  I think that there is a very high likelihood that sexual assaults occurred and I even brought up the UN report that you're suggesting [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6777.24s)]
*  That that there was a at least one documented instance of firsthand account testimony from one of the hostages [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6783.84s)]
*  That sexual assault had happened and [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6789.5599999999995s)]
*  that there is no reason to disparage or [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6792.08s)]
*  To claim that it did not happen when there is at least evidence that it did and that it had not changed the dynamic [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6796.32s)]
*  Of genocide for me even a little bit and I think that the way in which you said that to a lot of people sounded very very [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6802.12s)]
*  Dismissive well, especially to people who you know had had relatives who were perhaps murdered or taken away [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6808.599999999999s)]
*  You know the loss of life on that day so let me answer this question [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6815.36s)]
*  Let me let me answer this question now that you know the broader context. Do you feel as though? [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6819.28s)]
*  like do you feel like [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6825.28s)]
*  you were maybe [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6827.5199999999995s)]
*  Maybe duped I don't want to say duped but like that you saw this [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6829.679999999999s)]
*  That was like very clearly out of context. Did you does that change your opinion a little bit or I'm or do you feel like? [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6833.679999999999s)]
*  I'm running defense. I'm very much on the sort of [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6839.28s)]
*  So I never looked at what I saw and said this is justification for blockade genocide anything like that [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6844.839999999999s)]
*  But I did see you know [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6850.639999999999s)]
*  I'm also humanitarian and I I think that it's important when you're trying to solve a conflict [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6852.5599999999995s)]
*  When you're trying to stop violence that you honestly say what happened and what happened was I agree [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6858.44s)]
*  you know murderous militants went in to a music festival and murdered hundreds of teenagers in cold blood and [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6864.32s)]
*  Often massacred and mutilated them in ways that we have on camera and that is deeply traumatic to me [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6871.04s)]
*  and I guess this was linking to a broader point the [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6875.36s)]
*  Yes, I understand this whole thing, but there is context to this and you can't just sort of [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6878.48s)]
*  Suggest any violent action is just a file we get someone if they don't hold you like that. This is in damn [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6882.639999999999s)]
*  I don't but I don't do you think I know you're gonna maintain a position inside. You know it doesn't know [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6887.16s)]
*  But do you think I do you think I maintain that position do you think that I I think that it was wholeheartedly? [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6891.919999999999s)]
*  Justifiable I think certainly you haven't been very clear in your condemnations at times and I've watched what you said [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6898.2s)]
*  Okay, it doesn't seem you know for example [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6904.5599999999995s)]
*  Your talk you didn't mention what happened to seven once yeah, I mentioned it as the start of conflict [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6906.84s)]
*  You didn't mention. I don't even think it's the start of the conflict. I actually if you recall [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6912.96s)]
*  Started the conversation even before the inception of the state of Israel [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6917.96s)]
*  Then and then so there's a deliberate reason for why I did that because I think it's important to understand [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6922.599999999999s)]
*  The historical context in which goes but violent resistance there's no context for murdering hundreds of teenagers is so [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6927.28s)]
*  I think that I [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6933.84s)]
*  Yes, I think there is yes, there's also just like there's not a justified. I don't think it's a contextual justification [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6936.2s)]
*  I think it's a it's offering background and analysis analysis is not justification [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6942.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean, this is a deliberative body right where we're in we're in a in a space for free speech and [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6946.679999999999s)]
*  debate and I think that [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6952.719999999999s)]
*  This is actually ironically one of the things that I don't like about debate is that there is a woeful [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6954.64s)]
*  misinterpretation that exists in this space and [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6960.400000000001s)]
*  that especially when we talk about [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6963.72s)]
*  certain things like certain [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6966.0s)]
*  Subjects that are very difficult to broach in an open and honest manner [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6968.96s)]
*  I think a lot gets lost in the nuance and [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6973.04s)]
*  I think you understand where I'm coming from when I talk about this like that October 7 is [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6976.52s)]
*  I've never said that October 7 is like the inception or the first stage in what has unfolded [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6981.8s)]
*  I think that it's important to understand the context in which violent resistance has evolved whether it be Hamas [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6987.88s)]
*  Or whether it be any militancy against against like overarching [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=6994.360000000001s)]
*  oppressive [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7000.400000000001s)]
*  Colonial actions, but I suppose what I'm saying to you is there's time for nuance and there's also time to say something is unequivocally [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7001.76s)]
*  Evil and something is unequivocally unjustifiable [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7008.24s)]
*  I think I'm wondering why you can't you can say that correctly about the wealth of Israeli atrocities [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7011.76s)]
*  But to actually fix his conflicts and gain trust with people you need to say that [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7017.92s)]
*  Unequivocally about the murder of hundreds of teenagers at the Supernova music festival their mutilation and often their rape [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7021.72s)]
*  I don't know why you can't say that I don't first of all in terms of in terms of using [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7027.46s)]
*  The language of mutilation and rape and also consistently saying that there is a there is a [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7033.34s)]
*  contextual justification for it I [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7040.1s)]
*  think [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7042.820000000001s)]
*  the [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7044.3s)]
*  The violence that states engage in specifically an apartheid state [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7045.540000000001s)]
*  Which you agree is Israel's an apartheid state, okay [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7050.9400000000005s)]
*  So the violence that an apartheid state engages in is oftentimes considered to be invisible [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7053.400000000001s)]
*  There is a tremendous number of documented [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7058.14s)]
*  There's a tremendous number of [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7061.1s)]
*  Speakers and media representatives that have actively communicated all of the violence that has unfolded in October 7 [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7063.860000000001s)]
*  I myself have also [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7070.780000000001s)]
*  Maintained the position that any kind of violence against civilians is is completely unjustifiable [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7073.26s)]
*  But I think it's more productive to at least be a resilient voice that [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7078.46s)]
*  Especially in the West that tries to explain that these aren't [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7083.58s)]
*  Barbaric monsters that these are horrifying atrocities that they did right? [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7088.459999999999s)]
*  But that it is not coming out of a place of of you know, this antiquated anti-semitic [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7093.98s)]
*  Tendencies or that they wanted to go out and like do mass rapes or any number of different ways in which people have I think [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7100.7s)]
*  in a very unhelpful way tried to [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7107.7s)]
*  Claim that there is no emancipatory ambition here and that there is no [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7110.9s)]
*  There is no valid interest in in wanting to be rid of Israeli sovereignty [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7115.06s)]
*  Do you think that by invading the Gaza Strip that they were not that they were not motivated by anti-semitism? [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7119.780000000001s)]
*  Given the fact that they were murdering civilians indiscriminately invading the Gaza Strip by invading from the Gaza Strip into Israel [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7125.580000000001s)]
*  Do you think that they were not motivated by the sentence and given that they were murdering now? [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7131.580000000001s)]
*  No, no, no, no, I don't [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7135.06s)]
*  No, I don't [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7139.46s)]
*  You know, I don't know and if you don't recognize that then you're never gonna build any trust with the Jewish community if you have [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7142.02s)]
*  People who are out there and suggesting that your people don't have a right to exist [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7149.02s)]
*  The slogan of the Houthis who you so bar is death to the Jews [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7153.66s)]
*  I know and I've been very critical of that as well [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7156.32s)]
*  Well, I don't know enough not to platform somebody and call him a sexy pirate [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7158.52s)]
*  He's that person wasn't a that I don't know if you're aware of this or not [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7162.22s)]
*  But that was a 19 year old you have any teenager that was actually not associated with the onset of long [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7165.7s)]
*  There is enormous debate about that and it is highly unlikely he'd be fighting with them if he had no connections to them [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7169.62s)]
*  And he was not he was he was actually he was not fighting with them [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7174.9400000000005s)]
*  he there is a lot that gets lost in the translation and [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7178.9800000000005s)]
*  Certainly, I think a lot of commentary has existed in this space [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7182.62s)]
*  Of a conversation that I had ten months ago or at this eleven months ago before the onset Allah administration was even designated as a [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7186.62s)]
*  official state-sponsored [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7194.7s)]
*  terrorist [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7197.06s)]
*  Organization Joe Biden had actually taken them out of that classification that Donald Trump had put them in because of the fact that [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7198.3s)]
*  they were moving on that the Saudi Iranian normalization had taken place and [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7205.3s)]
*  That person the 19 year old [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7211.34s)]
*  Yemeni teenager I [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7214.34s)]
*  Originally thought was a Houthi and and I'm very open about that and you have been happy to give them. Oh, absolutely [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7216.14s)]
*  I think that there is it would have been it would have been a very different conversation [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7221.5s)]
*  Conversation but having said that if you think that I would have [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7225.26s)]
*  Like there were points in that conversation where I asked them directly. What do you think about Jewish people? [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7229.38s)]
*  Do you what would you what would you say? [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7233.74s)]
*  If I were to tell you that there are a lot of Jewish people who are leading anti-Zionist protests in America and his answer was [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7235.900000000001s)]
*  Very clear and it and this is a person that has [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7242.18s)]
*  And they said oh, I don't hate Palestinians [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7245.06s)]
*  You would critically engage in examine that but you do not critically engage and examine with this individual [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7247.7s)]
*  Yeah, because because an idea because an idea of soldier in many circumstances is living in similar conditions to someone like myself [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7252.9s)]
*  So I treat someone in the Western world with like Nazi ambitions very differently [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7260.94s)]
*  I think this is interesting because it's I don't know you don't have a moral universalism [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7266.86s)]
*  What I've heard from you is this very eloquent and I agree with it moral condemnation of the atrocities [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7270.0199999999995s)]
*  But when we talk about the murder of gay people on mass in Yemen when we talk about for example [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7275.46s)]
*  Tibet suppression under China or when we talk about what Hamas has done to gay people within that or what they do to Jewish hostages [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7279.62s)]
*  You enter this contextual bladder and it strikes me that these because you want to know why you want to know why? [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7286.46s)]
*  Because Israel has killed [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7292.18s)]
*  significantly larger numbers of gay Palestinians than Hamas has and that is precisely why I think it's a it's a [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7294.42s)]
*  universally unproductive conversation to [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7300.62s)]
*  Consistently talk about the many different moral failings [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7303.38s)]
*  Especially when I look at this with with my own personal background with the understanding that [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7307.06s)]
*  reactionary movements grow when there is [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7313.54s)]
*  outside [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7316.7s)]
*  When there are outside forces that are invading a country [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7317.9400000000005s)]
*  This is something that I actually talked about with respect to Ukraine as well that [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7321.9400000000005s)]
*  While there were many movements within Ukraine that were constantly fighting against [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7325.9400000000005s)]
*  paramilitary groups that it started off as like offshoots of football hooligans [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7331.1s)]
*  The as of brigade being one of them that once Ukraine was invaded by Russia [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7335.34s)]
*  That the inevitable violence was going to was going to make all of the most right-wing reactionary forces the [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7340.98s)]
*  Emancipatory forces that were going to dominate the country in perpetuity [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7349.099999999999s)]
*  We saw this with Iran the destabilization of Iran backed by the CIA [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7353.2s)]
*  caused the the the Ayatollah to to overtake the country because in most circumstances [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7357.179999999999s)]
*  When Western forces or an outside force is coming into your country [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7363.42s)]
*  You don't care about who is actually fighting back. You just want the pain to stop you want the violence to end and [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7369.78s)]
*  I examine I [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7377.62s)]
*  Examine this across the board in the exact same vein when a larger more powerful country [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7380.02s)]
*  Medals in the affairs of a smaller country no matter how big or small yeah, Iran exactly [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7386.38s)]
*  Iran is a perfect example of this [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7391.5s)]
*  I think that the Iranian destabilization and the implementation of the Shah regime is is quite literally the reason why the Ayatollah's were able to gain [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7393.139999999999s)]
*  momentum [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7400.679999999999s)]
*  of Iran in the other powers, but [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7401.78s)]
*  In terms of the broader problem with that, but do you understand where I'm coming from? [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7404.0199999999995s)]
*  Do you because there is unit because there is universality there? [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7407.34s)]
*  And I think the universality is hard to grasp especially if you've grown up in the United Kingdom or if you've grown up in America [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7410.86s)]
*  It's very difficult for people in the Western world to shed themselves of Western chauvinist frameworks and and [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7418.3s)]
*  Engage in and I'm not saying you're doing this but engage in what I have seen as [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7427.1s)]
*  pinkwashing by [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7431.78s)]
*  consistently talking about the internal dynamics of any kind of resistance group when in fact [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7433.22s)]
*  We do not make those considerations for many of our allies and it's not even something that is remotely brought up in this in this [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7438.02s)]
*  Conversation as far as like universality goes I've never heard anybody go [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7444.26s)]
*  We're we got to stop giving Saudi Arabia weapons because of the horrifying treatment of a people [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7447.820000000001s)]
*  I still think it's unjustifiable just like it's unjustifiable in Yemen [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7453.1s)]
*  But ultimately the way I look at it if there is a much larger much more powerful country that is getting [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7456.8s)]
*  Unlimited weapons from the most powerful country on the planet and they are engaging in wholesale slaughter. I think [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7462.820000000001s)]
*  Analyzing or interpreting the dynamic of like Hamas and and gay people in that regard is is [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7470.22s)]
*  Is ultimately not only unproductive, but also it's not something that is within our realm of power even [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7475.94s)]
*  I think that these countries my country Turkey for example [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7483.3s)]
*  Will inevitably once they have breathing room have the time and opportunity to be able to advocate for their own civil liberties because at [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7488.46s)]
*  the end of the day [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7495.42s)]
*  The the gay people that Hamas could potentially harm are still gay [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7496.82s)]
*  Palestinians does that make sense and it's in it and we come from we are we have the benefit of living in the UK or [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7502.9s)]
*  in the United States of America where we have undergone this process of [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7510.28s)]
*  civil liberties and advocacy for civil liberties and be able to overcome [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7514.219999999999s)]
*  These issues like the structural hurdles of systematic discrimination that that gay people face like I mean think about Alan Turing [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7519.179999999999s)]
*  I think there are two issues. Sorry if I just could respond quickly [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7525.46s)]
*  By all means sorry [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7533.5s)]
*  No, it's fine. I would love to sort of offer some of Cambridge Union's sort of fantastic hospitality. Maybe [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7535.86s)]
*  British culture [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7542.54s)]
*  Sure, can we film it can we still stream it? [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7545.5s)]
*  We can film we'll go to a pub have a pint you know, I've been debating for a very long time [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7548.18s)]
*  I love debating you know, I hate debating [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7552.860000000001s)]
*  That's the I am not a lot of people think I'm [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7556.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah, don't get anywhere in society that doing that sure but there's a there's a line of people too, so maybe we consider it [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7563.58s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7569.820000000001s)]
*  Do you guys want to take photos do you [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7572.740000000001s)]
*  Okay [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7574.74s)]
*  Okay, because I'll never stop I I've only been to spoons [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7577.54s)]
*  Okay, hell yeah, I love that [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7585.139999999999s)]
*  Hi [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7589.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7593.0599999999995s)]
*  There are a lot of comments I've seen some emo only moments where people just talking about parents and completely kind of ignoring these issues [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7596.86s)]
*  How do you deal with that? [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7603.7s)]
*  Well, I have a very diverse moderation team and they try to handle that at the best of their ability [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7605.179999999999s)]
*  we usually ban a lot of people that do that sort of stuff to just like [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7610.9s)]
*  You know to really stress the importance of not engaging in that sort of thing. It's very frustrating because like [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7614.66s)]
*  It's probably one of the best moderated communities to the best of our ability there [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7621.139999999999s)]
*  I mean when there's a stadium full of people and especially because I want to make sure [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7626.179999999999s)]
*  That anyone can talk most people will especially at this size [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7630.740000000001s)]
*  They'll usually do sub only like they'll do a lot of sub only chat or the limit like how you can communicate [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7634.58s)]
*  And I don't want to pay wall that at all [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7640.5s)]
*  That's why I have this like 10 10 minute follower mode so that we can withstand Bata tax usually [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7642.9400000000005s)]
*  But you know there are that's the downside of it [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7649.18s)]
*  Unfortunately where anyone and everyone can just like wait 10 minutes and they just say like a bunch of unhinged shit [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7652.5s)]
*  You know [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7657.900000000001s)]
*  Unfortunately [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7659.78s)]
*  I mean 30,000 people calling you ginger or gay is like a lot [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7661.94s)]
*  Was it were they doing that? [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7667.82s)]
*  That's crazy, yeah, I'm sorry about that [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7672.099999999999s)]
*  All right, no problem also for the record it is a very gay community so [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7681.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they're not [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7687.7s)]
*  I [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7691.7s)]
*  Love your glasses. Thank you. Oh, thank you. Oh, thank you [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7694.18s)]
*  You've assimilated well [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7701.82s)]
*  Okay, oh my god, yeah, like that's amazing and so when she found this event was going on she asked [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7707.42s)]
*  If I could do a favor for her she lives back in Texas of course she just wanted like a shout out or something [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7713.9s)]
*  Yeah, what do you want me to say? [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7719.0199999999995s)]
*  Just like a hi her name's like Chantelle. Chantelle? Yeah, okay [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7721.0199999999995s)]
*  What else but you know I'm sure you can think of something [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7724.219999999999s)]
*  Okay [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7726.219999999999s)]
*  Hi Chantelle, I hope you're having a great time in Texas you have a wonderful son here. He's great and [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7730.34s)]
*  I would say you know you should come to England [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7737.26s)]
*  Honestly, Texas might be maybe slightly marginally a little bit better better weather at least but I hope you're having a great time [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7740.16s)]
*  And thank you for watching [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7746.96s)]
*  Okay, all right, so she knows she knows [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7753.2s)]
*  She knows it the Sun sets at 3 p.m. Here, that's crazy that should not be allowed you guys need to fix that [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7759.2s)]
*  I don't know how [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7765.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's cold and dreary but in a lot of traffic, but it's still very nice sometimes so I like it [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7768.0s)]
*  No, I did yeah, this was great. You know sometimes it's good to let loose and debate a little bit [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7776.339999999999s)]
*  What made you get into like want to go on to twitch specifically as a platform to like [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7788.16s)]
*  Spread it's great question. Yeah [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7794.48s)]
*  So I played video games my whole life and I recognized that there was a real [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7797.5199999999995s)]
*  Gap in in in like video game politics space for leftist commentary and [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7806.0s)]
*  part of that was [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7813.839999999999s)]
*  Because like a lot of the gamers just at least the political gamers are very alt-right or center-right adjacent [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7815.48s)]
*  they constantly talk about like wokeness and video games and all this shit and [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7823.2s)]
*  I knew that that wasn't the case because I knew that like gamers are in general very diverse [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7827.4s)]
*  the other reason why I got on twitch was because I needed a place where I could just like [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7832.04s)]
*  endlessly talk and I felt like the live-streaming format was very conducive for that purpose and [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7837.04s)]
*  Now I can't seem to shut the fuck up [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7844.28s)]
*  So I guess it worked but that was those are the two primary reasons like I wanted to show that like you can be a progressive [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7846.16s)]
*  person and [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7851.5599999999995s)]
*  not necessarily [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7853.12s)]

*  you know a [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7857.96s)]

*  And a joy killer and I think that there's a lot of people like that out there [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7864.5599999999995s)]
*  they just want to have fun, but also be progressive and and not allow certain kinds of [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7867.84s)]
*  Certain kinds of aggressive bigoted behavior to exist in a community. So I wanted to create a safe space like that [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7873.76s)]
*  I agree. I feel like you've done a lot [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7879.44s)]
*  Particularly young man who I think otherwise might have been tempted by the outright [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7882.08s)]
*  Yeah, then it's kind of like position in social media and in gaming like you said [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7886.36s)]
*  So I think it's really good and like because as a female viewer, I feel like I am slightly outnumbered [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7890.679999999999s)]
*  Maybe by the men. Yeah, that might be a good thing [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7896.48s)]
*  Yeah, do you think that you have felt that you've had that impact? [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7900.24s)]

*  A lot of what I speak to is is directly trying to change the minds of people [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7909.839999999999s)]
*  Who don't share that opinion from the start? Yeah, so whether it be me talking about patriarchal [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7915.08s)]

*  You know the way I look at my background and everything else to suit that purpose and it just happens to be that I'm [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7934.96s)]
*  authentically myself and it works out that way, but [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7941.24s)]
*  But yeah, that's that's definitely a deliberate thing. I want I recognize that you know [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KXlGMRw3U&t=7944.84s)]
