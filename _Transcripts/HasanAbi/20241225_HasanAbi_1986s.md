*  We'll we'll even change into our Santa fits as well in a second. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1543.36s)]
*  But before I do that, we have an employed lawyer in the building. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1547.6s)]
*  Well, aren't you employed now? [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1553.2s)]
*  Yeah, no longer an unemployed lawyer, an employed lawyer. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1555.12s)]
*  I have a job now. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1558.32s)]
*  He passed the bar in the state of New York and we could talk a little bit about [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1559.52s)]
*  Luigi Mangione. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1564.96s)]
*  I thought. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1566.08s)]
*  Oh, sure. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1566.48s)]
*  The people's champion, the people's sweetheart as well. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1567.2s)]
*  As a matter of fact, he's he had his first court appearance the other day. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1571.44s)]
*  And people are some people are very excited about him and others are very upset that he exists. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1577.2s)]
*  And, you know, he did this deed allegedly on him. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1583.52s)]
*  I haven't seen any evidence. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1587.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1588.56s)]
*  Have you seen the evidence? [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1588.96s)]
*  No, I mean, it doesn't. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1590.08s)]
*  It's pretty light. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1590.88s)]
*  It's like, it's like, first of all, a lot of the forensic stuff that they talk about, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1591.6000000000001s)]
*  like fingerprints, it's not an exact science. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1596.08s)]
*  It's not. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1600.48s)]
*  It's not. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1601.28s)]
*  Many people act like it's like you're joking around. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1601.84s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1604.24s)]
*  I know it's not an exact science. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1606.08s)]
*  People people. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1607.4399999999998s)]
*  First of all, a lot of people travel through that area. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1608.3999999999999s)]
*  Midtown Manhattan. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1612.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's like, do you know how many fucking do you know how many fuck people are going to [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1613.4399999999998s)]
*  be passing through that area? [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1617.84s)]
*  There's just like so polluted, like any no any anything that you find any fingerprints, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1619.28s)]
*  supposedly find on scene are going to be can be any number of different people. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1624.08s)]
*  And also Italians. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1628.32s)]
*  Yeah, which all famously have similar. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1630.0s)]
*  Yeah, they have Italians. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1633.6s)]
*  Fun fact, people don't know those Italians all have the same fingerprint. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1635.1999999999998s)]
*  Usually like so similar that it really messes up in the forensic. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1638.6399999999999s)]
*  Is this how you're going to be advocating for your client? [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1642.72s)]
*  Show me evidence that says that's not the case. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1644.3999999999999s)]
*  Well, I think probably the most interesting thing that's happened so far, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1646.72s)]
*  in my opinion, is that in the in the complaint, they don't use that. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1649.68s)]
*  They don't use like the primary image that they had when they like were first circulating [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1655.1200000000001s)]
*  the images they use. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1660.16s)]
*  You know, the one where he it looks like the jacket kind of looks black [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1662.64s)]
*  and it's like a top down image. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1666.4s)]
*  It was like the first image that came out of him. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1668.8s)]
*  Yeah, where his face is not seen at all. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1671.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but they use every other image that they circulated in the news, but not that one. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1673.8400000000001s)]
*  And I feel like that one, that image doesn't really totally look like him. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1678.16s)]
*  The other ones maybe look a little more like him. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1683.76s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1686.16s)]
*  CIA, Patsy. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1687.3600000000001s)]
*  I don't believe that. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1688.64s)]
*  But hey, there's a lot of people who believe that there's a lot of people who believe that [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1689.52s)]
*  it's a CIA Patsy. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1695.28s)]
*  There's a lot of people who believe that there's like a vast surveillance apparatus. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1696.48s)]
*  And there was parallel construction on how they apprehended it. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1702.3200000000002s)]
*  I don't even believe that. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1704.88s)]
*  I think a lot of the narratives like if we're going to be for real, I think a lot of the [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1706.56s)]
*  narratives that have come out on the story are probably they're probably not untrue. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1710.0s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1715.92s)]
*  Where I just yeah, I think that there probably wasn't McDonald's employee that snitched. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1716.8799999999999s)]
*  It was a big story for the day for the week. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1721.2s)]
*  I don't I don't know. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1726.24s)]
*  Like, I mean, is there a massive web of surveillance in this country? [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1727.36s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1734.32s)]
*  But I think it's incredibly difficult to like come through terabytes and terabytes of data. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1735.2s)]
*  And I don't think artificial intelligence is as like good as the way that people think [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1740.24s)]
*  it is to directly figure out the movements of any individual. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1744.32s)]
*  He's just reading this off of a notepad that you have that has all these talking. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1750.8s)]
*  It's funny that you're saying that. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1756.0s)]
*  Does it sound like does it sound that convincing? [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1757.52s)]
*  That's cool. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1760.48s)]
*  But yeah, I just don't I don't I don't think that [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1762.64s)]
*  we're there yet with artificial intelligence and surveillance tech. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1765.6000000000001s)]
*  Like, it's not Minority Report. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1769.6000000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1770.96s)]
*  We're like, we found a guy like here's a direct match of who we think the suspect is. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1771.44s)]
*  And then this is like the route that he traveled through. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1777.44s)]
*  Like, I don't think it's I just don't think it is that good. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1780.96s)]
*  I think the stuff is powerful that they have, but it's more about it's more powerful in terms of [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1786.72s)]
*  finding people to pin things on. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1792.88s)]
*  And I mean, obviously, in the case of Luigi, there's a lot of evidence pointing in his direction. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1797.0400000000002s)]
*  But in general, you know, the kind of technology you're talking about, [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1802.72s)]
*  like geofencing data that Google uses when they comply with search warrant requests, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1807.6000000000001s)]
*  and they're they give like an anonymized list of all the people that were in a certain area [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1813.0400000000002s)]
*  to law enforcement when they're trying to like narrow down a search. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1818.0800000000002s)]
*  That stuff can pin things on on people who had nothing to do with a situation. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1821.68s)]
*  So I think in general, dangerous. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1827.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1830.24s)]
*  I think it is dangerous. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1830.5600000000002s)]
*  I think artificial intelligence is only something that you can utilize when you don't actually [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1832.48s)]
*  have to like find like pin with 100% accuracy a person. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1838.5600000000002s)]
*  I think artificial intelligence is good at creating lists of people, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1843.28s)]
*  lists of targets, lists of priorities that are not supposed to be correct. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1848.24s)]
*  Like lavender is the one I use as an example. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1852.08s)]
*  The lavender AI targeting system that Israel uses is obviously going to churn out targets at a much [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1854.32s)]
*  faster clip in comparison to human beings, because human beings are not able to process [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1860.4s)]
*  that much data with that much speed. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1868.8s)]
*  Whereas AI, and an instance where you don't have to actually produce a target that is literally [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1872.16s)]
*  like a militant or a general or whatever, and is just simply a Palestinian person, [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1877.76s)]
*  AI can be used as a plausible deniability. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1882.16s)]
*  AI, which is what Brian Thompson did as well, is perfect for denying claims, right? [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1884.32s)]
*  Denying claims that don't require like the claims that you normally wouldn't, [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1892.72s)]
*  you normally wouldn't deny, that human beings wouldn't deny. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1898.24s)]
*  AI is great at that. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1901.2s)]
*  Like having a 90% false. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1902.64s)]
*  What? [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1905.52s)]
*  Oh, having a 90% false denial rate is exactly what AI is supposed to be used for. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1905.9199999999998s)]
*  It's like a quarter. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1911.9199999999998s)]
*  It's only a quarter charged. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1913.9199999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1916.3999999999999s)]
*  All right. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1916.8799999999999s)]
*  Sonica. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1918.9599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1919.6799999999998s)]
*  No. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1920.8799999999999s)]
*  Happy Sonica. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1921.1999999999998s)]
*  Happy Sonica. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1922.1599999999999s)]
*  So who did it? [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1923.12s)]
*  Is my question. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1924.9599999999998s)]
*  I mean, look, you should never admit that your client might have done it, but [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1926.1599999999999s)]
*  but I don't, I don't, you know, I don't, I don't think it's like if we're being serious, [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1935.2s)]
*  I think, yeah, it's not, it's not unlikely that Luigi Mangione is the person. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1940.32s)]
*  I think he most likely is the guy. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1945.84s)]
*  That's what I think. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1947.84s)]
*  Typical. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1949.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1949.84s)]
*  Innocent until proven guilty. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1950.24s)]
*  Of course. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1951.6799999999998s)]
*  You, I mean, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1952.24s)]
*  If we're talking like that, if I'm not like speculating and then, yeah, of course, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1953.76s)]
*  of course he's innocent until proven guilty. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1961.36s)]
*  That's just how it works. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1963.6s)]
*  Except for Eric Adams, who I think is guilty 100% and should go to the slammer [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1964.7199999999998s)]
*  for the crime of going to Turkey that many times and never getting a hairline restoration surgery. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1969.6799999999998s)]
*  I think that's, that's his biggest guilt. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1974.08s)]
*  I like his lawyer. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1976.56s)]
*  I thought she did a good job at his arraignment. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NK6GVjD9XI&t=1978.3999999999999s)]
