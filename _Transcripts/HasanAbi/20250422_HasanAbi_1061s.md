*  She wants trump to watch the content nuke before talking to him. Yeah, that's what she is saying [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=104.4s)]
*  Tesla's profits are down 71% year over year [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=108.72s)]
*  Tesla posts a 400 million dollar profit down 71% year over year revenue is down nearly 2 billion compared to the same time last year [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=112.16000000000001s)]
*  Wow without the 595 million in automotive regulatory credits [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  Which other manufacturers buy off tesla to comply with emissions requirements tesla would have posted a loss this quarter [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=125.36s)]
*  and remember [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  a lot of the upstream [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=133.28s)]
*  Companies are also making their own [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=135.68s)]
*  Electric vehicles now, which is part of the reason why the regulatory credits [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=138.32s)]
*  are [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  Uh their regulatory credits which still keep tesla afloat, which is part of the reason why i despise elon musk [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=143.68s)]
*  so much [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=150.32s)]
*  And have for such a long time is because he's such an annoying piece of shit [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=151.6s)]
*  about [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=157.12s)]
*  The government and government expenditures when he is the number one welfare queen [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  Okay, the green credit swap scheme if it did not exist tesla literally would not exist [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=163.28s)]
*  I need you to understand this [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=170.08s)]
*  because [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=171.84s)]
*  There have been numerous instances where tesla almost defaulted where the only thing that kept it alive [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=172.88s)]
*  the only thing that kept it alive was this automotive regulatory credits which [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  Dictates that other companies other automotive industry companies that don't make [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=185.76s)]
*  You know renewable energy uh backed, you know, don't make like electric vehicles or whatever [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=192.16s)]
*  We'll turn around and purchase like to offset the the carbon footprint that they have [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=197.84s)]
*  They'll go around they go and give money to tesla to make it seem like oh tesla is [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=203.6s)]
*  Creating our ev fleet. Why did the tesla stock go up after this? Never mind is going vertical yet again [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=208.0s)]
*  This shit makes no sense. He's doubling down on the earnings call right now is so funny [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=212.32s)]
*  Uh, it might go up because he's gonna lie again. I assume he'll he'll unveil a new product that they're never gonna make [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=216.72s)]
*  He'll be like, yeah, i'm actually if you drive a tesla now [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  It's not only fully self-driving [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=227.44s)]
*  But also it can fly you to the moon and then people will be like, oh elon. He's so brilliant. He's gonna do it [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=229.84s)]
*  Watch the earnings call. I don't even know where to watch the earnings call [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=236.16000000000003s)]
*  This is unusual [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=239.60000000000002s)]
*  So at a private jp morgan jpm conference with the u.s [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=240.32000000000002s)]
*  Treasure secretary scott bison bison talked about u.s and china calling situation unsustainable the market rallied huge on the comments [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=242.48s)]
*  But did someone at the conference know before the comments that were leaked to bloomberg a huge [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=247.67999999999998s)]
*  uh s p x w [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=252.0s)]
*  what [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=254.95999999999998s)]
*  5,800 c expiring [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=256.46s)]
*  516 2025 was placed unusually it was 11 out of the money truly unusual the trader that made two million and 30 minutes after the comments [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=259.18s)]
*  a call option [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=265.59999999999997s)]
*  A lot of tech stocks shot up in the past 30 minutes because I think trouble was talking about how they might lower tariffs to china [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=267.36s)]
*  navidia is nvidia is up to [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=272.32s)]
*  Least on maybe a dozen times. It's been so many times [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=276.0s)]
*  Um, this is not one of those times. We're not on the right edge of path not even close [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=280.96000000000004s)]
*  um [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=286.16s)]
*  so [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=287.52000000000004s)]
*  But you know, there are some there are some challenges [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=289.44s)]
*  Um, and I expect that this year will be yeah, I said [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=292.40000000000003s)]
*  unexpected bumps [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=297.28000000000003s)]
*  But I remain extremely optimistic about the future of the company [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=299.76s)]
*  um [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=304.23999999999995s)]
*  the future of the company is fundamentally based upon [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=305.84s)]
*  uh [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=309.91999999999996s)]
*  large-scale autonomous cars [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=310.79999999999995s)]
*  And and and large scale in large volume vast numbers of autonomous humanoid robots [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=315.76s)]
*  so [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=323.11999999999995s)]
*  The uh [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=325.76s)]
*  The value of a company that makes truly useful autonomous humanoid robots and autonomous [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=329.84s)]
*  Useful vehicles at scale at low cost, which is what tesla is going to do is [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=338.0s)]
*  uh staggering um [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=344.71999999999997s)]
*  I continue to believe that tesla with uh, excellent execution will be the most valuable company in the world by far [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=347.76s)]
*  um [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=356.55999999999995s)]
*  But that's an important if we must execute well [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=357.76s)]
*  But uh [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=362.32s)]
*  I I think tesla will be the most valuable company in the world by far. It may be as valuable as the next five companies combined [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=365.59999999999997s)]
*  So [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=373.52s)]
*  But there'll be a few bumps along the road before who's buying this I mean it's the same people that bought in on walter bloomberg [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=378.24s)]
*  falsely claiming that donald trump was going to do [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=385.94s)]
*  a 90-day pause [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=389.46s)]
*  okay, because of like one random answer that came from [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=391.62s)]
*  uh an administrative figure [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=395.86s)]
*  And then the market recovered [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=398.58s)]
*  four trillion dollars worth of value [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=401.28s)]
*  in a matter of hours [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=404.5s)]
*  Until the white house came out and said we're not going to do that [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=407.46s)]
*  None of this shit makes sense [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=411.14s)]
*  Okay [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=413.86s)]
*  It's all people that are holding on and trying to create the appearance of confidence [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=415.3s)]
*  Because they already have so much stock they have too much investment. It's a sunk cost for them. So they have to hope [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=422.5s)]
*  That other people will get on board with it. It's just all cope [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=429.62s)]
*  It will really go exponentially from there [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=433.14s)]
*  So that's [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=436.66s)]
*  I'd encourage people to look beyond like the [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=439.14s)]
*  You know [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=442.02s)]
*  Some sort of bumps and potholes of each road immediately ahead of us [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=446.9s)]
*  Lift your gaze to the bright shining [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=456.18s)]
*  You know sort of down the hill, I don't know some regan-esque imagery [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=462.02s)]
*  Um [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=468.26s)]
*  And uh [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=470.5s)]
*  That's where we're headed and not too distant future like I said and the next year or something so [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=473.53999999999996s)]
*  Let's see, um [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=482.9s)]
*  With respect to supply chain risk something that's something that tesla has been working on for several years is to localize supply chains [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=487.21999999999997s)]
*  Um, this actually makes sense from a cost standpoint from a and from a logistics risk standpoint [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=495.53999999999996s)]
*  um [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=503.7s)]
*  Is to have the supply chains be at least confident at all in what he's saying [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=505.29999999999995s)]
*  This is how he sounds all the time now. This is how he sounds and so [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=509.29999999999995s)]
*  We are [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=514.1s)]
*  the least [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=515.6999999999999s)]
*  A company the least affected car company [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=517.62s)]
*  with respect to tariffs [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=521.06s)]
*  At least in most respects, I mean remains to be seen [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=523.38s)]
*  um [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=526.66s)]
*  Now tariffs are still [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=528.3399999999999s)]
*  You know tough on a company when margins are still low [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=531.38s)]
*  But [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=535.6199999999999s)]
*  We do have localized supply chains in both america europe and china, so [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=537.2199999999999s)]

*  Um [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=553.3s)]
*  And I i'm doubtfully i'm going to get a lot of questions about tariffs and I I just want to emphasize that [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=561.6199999999999s)]
*  um [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=566.9s)]
*  The tariff decision is entirely up to the president of the united states [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=568.18s)]
*  um [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=571.54s)]
*  I will weigh in with my advice with the president which he [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=572.42s)]
*  He will listen to my advice, but then it's up to him of course to make his decision [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=576.26s)]
*  um [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=581.38s)]
*  I i've been on the record many times saying that I believe [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=582.58s)]
*  Lower tariffs are generally a good idea. Um for prosperity [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=586.58s)]
*  But this decision is fundamentally up to the elected representative of the people being the president of the united states. So [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=591.0600000000001s)]
*  um [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=597.38s)]
*  You know i'll continue to advocate for [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=598.6600000000001s)]
*  um [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=601.3000000000001s)]
*  Lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs, but uh, that's all I can do. He's the most protected despite having [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=602.5s)]
*  No, no, let me walk you through why i'm so excited about the picture despite having a bunch of components that come directly from china [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=608.8199999999999s)]
*  despite china being the [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=616.02s)]
*  Monopoly of battery manufacturing. How could you claim to be the most protected? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=618.4s)]
*  You're for people are so stupid for buying into this. They're so stupid in austin [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=623.86s)]
*  and then [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=630.3399999999999s)]
*  Actually, you should parse out the terms for robotaxi and just generally like [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=631.78s)]
*  What's the the cyber cab because we've got a product called the cyber cab and then but any any [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=635.38s)]
*  uh [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=641.54s)]
*  Tesla which could be an s3 x or y that is autonomous is a robotic taxi or robotaxi [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=642.74s)]
*  It's like confusing. Um [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=648.82s)]
*  so [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=651.62s)]
*  The vast majority of the tesla fleet that we've made is capable of being a robot taxi or robotic taxi [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=652.98s)]
*  Um [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=660.66s)]
*  And uh as we're going from [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=663.0600000000001s)]
*  Once we can make [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=667.78s)]
*  The whole system work where you can have paid rides fully autonomously with no one in the car [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=669.22s)]
*  in in one city [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=674.42s)]
*  that [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=676.1s)]
*  That is a very scalable thing for us to go broadly within [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=677.38s)]
*  the point of whatever jurisdiction allows us to to operate [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=681.86s)]
*  so [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=685.78s)]
*  Because what we're solving for is a general solution to autonomy [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=686.74s)]
*  Not a city specific solution for autonomy [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=691.78s)]
*  uh [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=695.0600000000001s)]
*  Once we make it work in a few cities, we can basically make it work in all cities in that in that [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=696.02s)]
*  Legal jurisdiction so if it's once we can make it based to work in a few cities in america [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=702.98s)]
*  Tesla is blaming partial production shutdowns on the quarterly decline in deliveries [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=707.54s)]
*  But then also blaming supply stock and sales incentives for lower revenues make it make sense [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=711.0600000000001s)]
*  The real answer is that their demand went down because duh limited only by this is megafonics is [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=716.1s)]
*  Super bowl, by the way, i'm reacting to a fucking [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=721.38s)]
*  tesla earnings call is crazy using artificial intelligence [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=724.66s)]
*  and the uh an ai chip that tesla designed specifically for this purpose [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=730.74s)]
*  um [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=736.98s)]
*  as opposed to [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=738.74s)]

*  so [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=750.0999999999999s)]
*  General solutions specific solution [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=751.38s)]

*  Then you could double the energy output [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=864.34s)]

*  But in order to do that you need to buffer the engines [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=870.1800000000001s)]
*  So that you can charge up the something like battery pack at night and the discharge into the grid during the day [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U92uA15Pf4Y&t=873.86s)]
