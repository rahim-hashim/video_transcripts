# Ethan Klein Has Been Exposed | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI)
*  Ethan Klein does Hasbro on a regular basis. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=0.0s)]
*  Owen Jones, on the other hand, at least uses a lot of the space [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=3.12s)]
*  and a lot of the platform that he has to, to, you know, call out Israel. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=6.4s)]
*  What is this confirmed? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=16.28s)]
*  What Hassan's favorite Twitter user? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=18.0s)]
*  What is this? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=20.28s)]
*  Ayyub Lovely really touched by this. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=20.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  Agree with everything that Twitter user Ayyub Lovely says. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=23.88s)]
*  And if you don't like it, you can get what? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  Why did, why did this post? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=28.96s)]
*  What Hassan's favorite Twitter user, Ayyub Lovely? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=31.44s)]
*  What is the, oh my God, what is going on, dude? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=34.32s)]
*  What the f***? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=38.64s)]
*  There's a non-zero chance he talks about you tomorrow and threatens to sue. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=40.0s)]
*  I think every ounce of pain I've endured through my life would finally be justified [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  if I could get in a courtroom with Ethan Klein. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=45.28s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  Ayyub's shitposts about you are so good. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=48.72s)]
*  The context is what? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=53.72s)]
*  Ethan Klein, you are the laughingstock of the world because you and your wife are unable [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=56.08s)]
*  to stop feeding your children dog shit in your press with your incompetence and taking [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=59.08s)]
*  heroic doses of Zembe that look like Russell Brand undergoing futile chemotherapy followed [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=62.0s)]
*  by Hassan by the way, you shouldn't be friends with Israelis. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=67.08s)]
*  You shouldn't be polite to Israelis. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=70.04s)]
*  You should eat Israeli food or go to Israeli restaurants or dance with Israelis at clubs [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=71.32s)]
*  or associate with any Israeli person at all. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=74.92s)]
*  Anything short of permanent unconditional hostility is betrayal. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=77.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=80.6s)]
*  What Ethan doesn't know is that I don't only follow Ayyub Lovely. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=82.32s)]
*  I am Ayyub Lovely. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=86.91999999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=88.44s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=89.44s)]
*  This has 40,000 likes. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=90.44s)]
*  Holy f***. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=92.44s)]
*  Dude, every time I think like this kind of sentiment, like no one knows the crazy shit [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=93.96s)]
*  that Ethan is engaging in. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=102.39999999999999s)]
*  No one is aware of it. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=104.08s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=106.0s)]
*  And then I see a post like this get in the same go viral as f*** and I'm like, Oh my [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=107.44s)]
*  God, I guess more people are aware of the things that Ethan has been doing. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  He's talking about Owen Jones there, which is the funniest part. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=118.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=121.8s)]
*  I saw some of the Owen Jones attacks. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=122.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=125.64s)]
*  I don't agree with Ayyub Lovely on that. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=127.68s)]
*  I don't know the full details of what Owen Jones, I get why, especially a British person [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=129.48s)]
*  especially a British socialist would despise Owen Jones for what he did to Corbin. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=134.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=140.8s)]
*  But I don't know. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=142.36s)]
*  I think everyone plays a different role in this and Owen Jones for the most part is, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  is fine. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  Like I think it's, it's all right. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=149.64000000000001s)]
*  He's he's fine. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=152.08s)]
*  He's just, I don't have any smoke for Owen Jones. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=153.32000000000002s)]
*  I think he went to a gay party. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=156.04000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=158.68s)]
*  I have not followed the drama, but I love people shitting on Owen Jones and H production. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=159.68s)]
*  Like Ethan Klein does Hasbro on a regular basis. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=163.58s)]
*  Owen Jones on the other hand, at least uses a lot of the space and a lot of the platform [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=168.42000000000002s)]
*  that he has to, to, you know, call out Israel. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=172.34s)]
*  You know, he does see what Daniel Monte has to say, bro. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=176.62s)]
*  Don't fuck with Ayyub Lovely. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=180.58s)]
*  How can I fuck Ayyub Lovely? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=182.78s)]
*  Once again, I have to say I am Ayyub Lovely. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=184.18s)]
*  Oh, it's me. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=187.98000000000002s)]
*  Ayyub Lovely. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=189.46s)]
*  Hello. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=190.46s)]
*  I've been posting. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=191.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=193.34s)]
*  The reason why you can't dox me is because I've been in broad daylight and public all [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=194.34s)]
*  along. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=201.14000000000001s)]
*  Hello, mate. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=202.14000000000001s)]
*  You need, you need to know that the sex party Owen Jones went to was called Butt Mitzvah. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=203.14000000000001s)]
*  Oh, what is going on? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=207.62s)]
*  You suck at accents. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=211.62s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=213.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=214.58s)]
*  Are you sure? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=215.58s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=217.58s)]
*  While I was portraying this accent as Ayyub Lovely, when I went on my favorite podcast, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=218.58s)]
*  Chappo Trap House and started my very own new podcast, Ayyub Lovely and Friends, Bangers [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=225.10000000000002s)]
*  and Mash. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=233.70000000000002s)]
*  I'm Ayyub Lovely. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=234.70000000000002s)]
*  Put the beans on the toast and the fries in the chippies in the bag, lad. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=236.26000000000002s)]
*  Oh no, I assume that's what, that's what they talk about. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=241.02s)]
*  Scroungers. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=244.70000000000002s)]
*  The podcast Scroungers. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=245.82s)]
*  I made it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=247.1s)]
*  It's my podcast. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=248.1s)]
*  I'm Ayyub Lovely. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=249.1s)]
*  We talk about Yorkshire, Spotted Dick, Bangers and Mash, things like that. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=251.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=258.42s)]
*  Bunch of proper geezers talking about England. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=259.42s)]
*  It's coming home, lads. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=263.5s)]
*  That sort of thing. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=265.21999999999997s)]
*  I think like Ayyub Lovely is going to be east. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=269.94s)]
*  Yeah, I hope not. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=272.82s)]
*  I hope it doesn't come after me. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=274.14s)]
*  I already have Bad Empanada up my ass. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=276.06s)]
*  I don't want, I don't want Ayyub Lovely to come after me. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=279.82s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=284.82s)]
*  What would Butt Mitzvah even be? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=290.14s)]
*  I don't want to know. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=293.26s)]
*  I don't want to know. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=294.78s)]
*  I don't know what happened with Owen Jones. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=296.18s)]
*  I think again, he's, he's a, he's a bit squishy, but I think you have to be a bit squishy to [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=298.54s)]
*  a certain degree in order to maintain a platform in mainstream, in mainstream media in general. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=305.98s)]
*  And I think that squishy people who are still pro Palestine play a decent role in moving [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=311.90000000000003s)]
*  libs in that direction as well. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=318.1s)]
*  But then again, I don't fully understand British, British media and that dynamic in general. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=321.03999999999996s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=330.47999999999996s)]
*  But like as a, as a diehard Corbynite, as a Jezza head, okay, as a loyal servant of [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=332.06s)]
*  the Hezbollah's favorite politician, Jeremy Corbyn, I am his favorite commentator, Hassan [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=342.0s)]
*  Abiy Piker. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=349.0s)]
*  And I will, I will always, I will always ride with Corbyn. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODSbl8NBKNI&t=350.0s)]
