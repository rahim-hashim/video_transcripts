*  You know what I mean? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugDI0_nWLN0&t=400.34s)]
*  Cause I feel as though I feel as though, you know, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugDI0_nWLN0&t=401.34s)]
*  this kind of commentary only works if your entire audience is like [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugDI0_nWLN0&t=405.34s)]
*  14 years old, you know what I mean? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugDI0_nWLN0&t=410.34s)]
*  It's like so childish. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugDI0_nWLN0&t=412.34s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugDI0_nWLN0&t=413.34s)]
*  I mean, clearly there's still a market for it. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugDI0_nWLN0&t=415.34s)]
*  It's like, I hope they're mostly children and they're not like [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugDI0_nWLN0&t=418.34s)]
*  straight up adults. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugDI0_nWLN0&t=421.34s)]
*  And they're not adults that have this like childlike brain capacity [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugDI0_nWLN0&t=423.34s)]
*  because that would be kind of sad. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugDI0_nWLN0&t=427.34s)]
*  But who knows, you know, who knows? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugDI0_nWLN0&t=429.34s)]

*  He's awfully sensitive. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugDI0_nWLN0&t=439.34s)]
*  I know I did see another piece of drama specifically between [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugDI0_nWLN0&t=440.34s)]
*  Kyson at and XQC. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugDI0_nWLN0&t=444.34s)]
*  Apparently XQC was like talking shit about Kai and the content he [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugDI0_nWLN0&t=447.34s)]
*  makes and Kai popped off on them. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugDI0_nWLN0&t=450.34s)]
*  But I want to, I want to look at that real quick, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugDI0_nWLN0&t=453.34s)]
*  but that's not the only thing I actually saw that was like weird [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugDI0_nWLN0&t=456.34s)]
*  about the whole process. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugDI0_nWLN0&t=460.34s)]
*  This is something that I've, this is a more of a meta commentary. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugDI0_nWLN0&t=461.34s)]
*  Don't bite. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugDI0_nWLN0&t=464.34s)]
*  No, no, no, I'm not. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugDI0_nWLN0&t=465.34s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugDI0_nWLN0&t=466.34s)]
*  This is not about XQC or a Kyson ad at all. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugDI0_nWLN0&t=467.34s)]
*  He did the same shit he does to you and others. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugDI0_nWLN0&t=470.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugDI0_nWLN0&t=472.34s)]
*  I don't know if it's like fake drama or if it's real drama or not, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugDI0_nWLN0&t=473.34s)]
*  cause I, I thought they were boys, but there is a meta commentary that [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugDI0_nWLN0&t=475.34s)]
*  I want to, that I want to engage with. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugDI0_nWLN0&t=480.34s)]
*  Kai has been sneak dissing X about his gambling activities in the past month. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugDI0_nWLN0&t=482.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugDI0_nWLN0&t=485.34s)]
*  Here. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugDI0_nWLN0&t=486.34s)]
*  This is one of the, this is one of the videos that I saw. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugDI0_nWLN0&t=487.34s)]
