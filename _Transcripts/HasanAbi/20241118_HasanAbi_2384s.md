# Elon Musk, Top Trump Adviser Clash Over Cabinet Picks | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [November 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok)
*  I like that JD Vance. Look, I'm going to say something about JD Vance right now. I think [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=0.0s)]
*  JD Vance is smart. Okay. He's a massive Brown noser. He's a ginormous, but I think JD Vance [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=5.26s)]
*  is very smart. Why? Why? Notice how he's absent from the, from the transition team conversations. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=11.72s)]
*  Why is JD Vance not around Donald Trump as much as someone like Elon Musk is. Let's get [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=21.34s)]
*  back to let's move away from a theory or American or, or, you know, the parallels between the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=32.54s)]
*  rise of Nazi power. And let's get back to drama heated confrontation between Elon Musk [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=41.379999999999995s)]
*  and Trump advisor Axios reports. At least these guys are still unimaginably incompetent. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=48.1s)]
*  Did you see the problem for Democrats? Podsave America? What are they saying? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=54.260000000000005s)]
*  Is that you have this explicitly conservative media ecosystem. And I'm not talking about [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=57.940000000000005s)]
*  Joe Rogan here or Logan Paul. I'm talking about Ben Shapiro and Candace Owens and, you know, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=62.7s)]
*  talk radio and cable news and things like that. And they exist to professionally shit [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=68.74000000000001s)]
*  on Democrats. And that's what they do all day, every day. And then you have a progressive media [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=75.26s)]
*  ecosystem with, with people like Chapo Trap House or Hassan Piker. And that progressive media [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=80.34s)]
*  ecosystem also exists to shit on Democrats. And so from both sides, the Democratic party is just [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=86.10000000000001s)]
*  getting savaged and criticized. This is untrue. I, unlike mainstream media have openly defended [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=94.14s)]
*  the Democratic party when they do good things, Chapo included as a matter of fact, the example [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=101.9s)]
*  I will give you is perhaps the most important example, Joe Biden's Afghanistan withdrawal, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=109.30000000000001s)]
*  the entire liberal media ecosystem shit on Joe Biden. On the other hand, me and Chapo Trap House [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=116.34s)]
*  defended Joe Biden for withdrawing American troop presence from Afghanistan. And we never straight [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=126.74000000000001s)]
*  away from that, because we have principles. Not only that, but also I'll go so far as to say that I [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=134.9s)]
*  defended Lina Khan majority report as well, myself and majority reporter as well, defended the FTC [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=144.1s)]
*  anti-trust agenda and the NLRB's movement towards beefing up the American labor movement [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=150.82000000000002s)]
*  significantly more than mainstream media did. So the idea that we were shitting on the Democrats [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=159.22s)]
*  nonstop is silly. Okay. You should define criticism instead of saying you defend your positions. I [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=165.78s)]
*  think he's just dumb. Yeah. Like this is, this is dumb. There are people out there that are [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=171.14000000000001s)]
*  independent content creators on the progressive side of politics on the left side of politics, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=176.18s)]
*  that openly have defended the defensible aspects of the democratic leadership. Okay. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=181.22s)]
*  No matter what they do. And that's a real problem for Democrats. This kind of imbalance of how both [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=187.46s)]
*  ideological extremes basically make their money taking shots at Democrats. Yeah. Felix said, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=194.34s)]
*  Joe Biden is the most progressive president in my lifetime. Pre Gaza. I've said that as well, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=199.54s)]
*  because it's true pre October, 2023, which was a devastating month for the legacy of Joe Biden. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=204.1s)]
*  And he deserves to be devastated. Let's just, you know, make no mistake. There was still plenty. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=211.22s)]
*  There was still plenty that the Democrats had, there was a plenty of the Democrats had left on [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=217.22s)]
*  the table in terms of like the, the underlying problems that people were experiencing, refusing [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=223.62s)]
*  to address them. Plenty of other issues within the administration that I was critical of in terms [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=230.34s)]
*  of like not whipping votes fast enough, for example, for Joe Biden's agenda. Okay. The [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=235.38s)]
*  problem is October, 2023, Joe Biden, two days before October 7 unveiled his right wing. Okay. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=241.3s)]
*  And the right wing border bill that they were presenting as a gotcha, which was a idiotic move [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=248.98000000000002s)]
*  to begin with. Okay. And then October 7 happened and Joe Biden was like, I please. Okay. And then [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=253.94s)]
*  it's over after that. We need kind of a, you know, I don't know if it's an expansion of pod save [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=259.06s)]
*  America until you guys are the number one podcast in the country, but we need something to counteract [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=264.9s)]
*  that because it's not working right now. Welcome to my life for the last seven years. But yeah, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=269.46s)]
*  I digress. Let's get back to the heated competition between Elon Musk and Trump. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=274.58s)]
*  Developing this morning reports that new first best friend, Elon Musk is starting to irritate [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=277.94s)]
*  president elect Trump's advisors during a dinner at Mar-a-Lago Axios reports of a heated [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=283.38s)]
*  confrontation between Musk and Trump advisor and attorney Boris Epstein. They write quote, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=288.5s)]
*  at one point during what the sources described as a massive blow up, Musk accused Epstein of leaking [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=293.46s)]
*  details of Trump's transition, including a personnel picks to the media. Epstein responded [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=298.98s)]
*  by telling Musk that he didn't know what he was talking about. This comes amid new reports that [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=304.02s)]
*  Musk is also becoming a source of infighting the Trump transition team surrounding the choice for [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=308.18s)]
*  treasury secretary. Musk is backing Trump transition co-chair and fellow billionaire [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=313.7s)]
*  Howard Lutnick for the job. Well, Trump's advisors are pushing for hedge fund CEO Scott Besson, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=319.46s)]
*  the billionaire not only putting his two or 10 cents in, but also asking his more than 200 million [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=325.62s)]
*  followers to weigh in. He posted to Twitter, quote, would be interesting to hear more people weigh in [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=331.94s)]
*  on this for real Donald Trump to consider feedback. My view for what it's worth is Besson [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=339.21999999999997s)]
*  is a business as usual choice, whereas Howard Lutnick will actually enact change. Business as [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=344.65999999999997s)]
*  usual is driving America bankrupt. We need change one way or another. Well, this now is national [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=350.82s)]
*  political correspondent for Politico, Meredith McGraw. You know, it's pretty interesting. So [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=357.46s)]
*  Musk is in the room where it happens a lot of time, but he's also tweeting from outside the room, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=361.94s)]
*  trying to influence things. Well, it's not just Musk who has inserted himself into the transition. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=368.26s)]
*  It's really Trump's whole, you know, early kitchen cabinet here, advisors, people, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=373.94s)]
*  Mar-a-Lago members, friends that are weighing in. But Musk is spending a lot of time with [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=379.14s)]
*  Donald Trump since he got elected. He's been an ever present person at Trump's side at his club. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=384.82s)]
*  He's sitting in on meetings. He's traveling with him like he did this weekend to the professional [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=391.53999999999996s)]
*  UFC fight in New York City. And he is spending a lot of time with Trump. He's giving his insight [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=398.66s)]
*  and input on some of these picks, including most recently Treasury Secretary, which is one of the [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=404.66s)]
*  last really big remaining cabinet picks that Trump has yet to announce. And there's already been some [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=411.06s)]
*  in-fighting behind the scenes and jockeying between different potential candidates, including Howard [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=417.3s)]
*  Letnick, who is currently co-chair of Trump's transition, hedge fund CEO Scott Besson, and some [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=423.3s)]
*  other dark horse candidates who have now, their names have come up because of this back and forth [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=430.58s)]
*  and different people getting involved in the process. Any sign that Trump would go against [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=437.46000000000004s)]
*  Musk at this point? Have we seen an area yet where the two have disagreed, where Trump went [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=444.02s)]
*  another way? You know, I don't know about that, but you know, certainly Trump is really, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=449.7s)]
*  you know, taking his input seriously. He is keeping him around. He is involved in a lot of these [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=456.02s)]
*  different meetings. You know, I like that JD Vance look, I'm going to say something about JD Vance [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=463.53999999999996s)]
*  right now. I think JD Vance is smart. Okay. He's a massive brown noser. He's a ginormous piece of [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=470.5s)]
*  shit. But I think JD Vance is very smart. Why? Why? Notice how he's absent from the, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=476.42s)]
*  from the transition team conversations. Why is JD Vance not around Donald Trump as much as [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=485.38s)]
*  someone like Elon Musk is? Why does it seem like Elon Musk has taken the role of JD Vance in the [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=491.78000000000003s)]
*  administration all of a sudden, because he knows how Donald Trump operates. JD Vance has made a [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=497.86s)]
*  career off of shoving his nose in the assholes of narcissistic billionaires exactly like Donald [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=504.58s)]
*  Trump. That is how he has maintained a career for himself. So he knows what not to do. JD Vance is [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=512.8199999999999s)]
*  just biding his time as Donald Trump and Elon Musk inevitably despise one another. Okay. That's it. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=521.3s)]
*  Peter Thiel's blood boy is I'm sure, you know, talking to Trump every now and then, but it's [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=529.38s)]
*  very clear. It's very clear to me that he is staying out of the limelight right now, because [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=535.9399999999999s)]
*  he doesn't want to piss off boss man. He's letting Elon Musk do that job for him. That's why you're [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=542.58s)]
*  not hearing that much from JD Vance in this conversation. Musk came with Trump to Washington, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=548.82s)]
*  DC last week when Trump on the plane made the decision that he was going to appoint [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=557.46s)]
*  Matt Gaetz to his attorney general. But, you know, other people who've been around Trump include, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=563.22s)]
*  of course, Suzy Wiles, Linda McMahon, who's also co-chairing the transition, Howard Lehtnick, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=569.14s)]
*  and then a lot of aides and advisors who are around him as well, too. All right, Maren, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=576.02s)]
*  for growing up in Politico, thanks so much for being with us this morning. We have new Trump [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=580.02s)]
*  animations. I love it. I like it, too. It's like speaking of the Saints. It's like glorious. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=583.38s)]
*  I know. It took forever to book that. Well, from Saints to Cabinet comes marching in. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=589.06s)]
*  President-elect Donald Trump is expected to focus on filling out his economic team [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=594.02s)]
*  after making another key appointment yesterday. Bill Mollusion is live in West Palm Beach, Florida. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=598.66s)]
*  Hey, Bill. Hey, Ainsley. Good morning to you. So, obviously, the economy was a huge pillar [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=604.18s)]
*  of Donald Trump's campaign this time around. So, there's a lot of eagerness out there to find out [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=609.22s)]
*  who is he going to select as his Treasury Secretary. That's still up in the air right now, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=613.38s)]
*  but a handful of names are being tossed out there for consideration. Take a look. According to the [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=618.0999999999999s)]
*  Wall Street Journal and New York Times, these are four of the guys they're looking at, a couple of [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=622.42s)]
*  which reportedly met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago in recent days. Kevin Warsh, former Federal Reserve [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=626.02s)]
*  Governor. Mark Rowan, a Wall Street billionaire. Howard Lehtnick, the CEO of Canter Fitzgerald. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=631.78s)]
*  And then investor Scott Bessent. Now, Trump did make one pick yesterday for his administration. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=637.38s)]
*  You guys just mentioned this. He named Brendan Carr as his Chairman of the FCC. Carr currently [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=643.78s)]
*  serves as the Senior Republican Commissioner on the FCC. And in naming him, Trump said in part, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=650.3399999999999s)]
*  quote, he will end the regulatory onslaught that has been crippling America's job creators and [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=656.18s)]
*  innovators and ensure that the FCC delivers for rural America. Now, Trump made a few picks on [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=661.38s)]
*  Saturday as well. Take a look. The biggest of them was Chris Wright. He is going to serve as [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=667.22s)]
*  Trump's Energy Secretary. That's a big position. It oversees the stockpiles of US military [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=671.78s)]
*  nuclear weapons. William Sharpe is tapped to be a White House Staff Secretary. And then you got [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=678.26s)]
*  Caroline Levitt, who is tapped to be Press Secretary. She'll be sparring with the media [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=684.42s)]
*  in the coming years. She's 27 years old. That makes her the youngest Press Secretary ever. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=688.34s)]
*  As for Trump's other picks, Democrats have been throwing cold water. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=693.86s)]
*  Megaphonics asks, why is he putting Pete Hegseth in these positions if he's going with more [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=697.3000000000001s)]
*  competent weirdos for these other positions? And the reason is simple. First of all, I just want [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=704.26s)]
*  to say I'm sad that this is confirmation that Alex Jones will not be Trump's Press Secretary. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=710.74s)]
*  But also, the reason for Pete Hegseth is because if Donald Trump wants to use the military to [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=716.98s)]
*  violate the American Constitution and the violate pre-existing American laws, that position requires [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=723.38s)]
*  a loyalist more than a competent administrator. Pete Hegseth is a psycho. He is infinitely more [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=730.58s)]
*  likely to fulfill Donald Trump's wishes of using the American military on US soil to engage in mass [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=737.94s)]
*  deportations. That's it. That's also the reason why, and this is like not as frequently reported [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=744.74s)]
*  on for some reason, they're also gearing towards a new appointment structure, or at least like [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=751.14s)]
*  an outside former general board that will determine whether or not certain appointments are eligible [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=760.02s)]
*  for general positions. They're looking to change the entirety of the DOD to ensure loyalty at every [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=767.78s)]
*  step. That's the goal here. They want to utilize the military to do whatever the f*** they want to do. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=777.38s)]
*  And in that situation, you need loyalists at the top. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=784.5s)]
*  So of course not. America deserves better. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=797.9399999999999s)]
*  A Republican Senator who votes to confirm Matt Gaetz or Robert Kennedy or Tulsi Gabbard [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=801.78s)]
*  will be remembered by history as somebody who completely gave up their responsibility to [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=809.4599999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump. Yeah, okay. Guys, it was interesting. Just a short time ago this morning, the hosts of [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=815.4599999999999s)]
*  MSNBC's Morning Joe program announced that they privately met face to face with Donald Trump [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=820.5799999999999s)]
*  at Mar-a-Lago on Friday. They said it was their first meeting with him in seven years and that [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=827.38s)]
*  while they disagree with him on a variety of topics, they agreed to reopen lines of communication, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=832.9799999999999s)]
*  saying they don't want to just talk about Donald Trump. They want to start talking to him again. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=838.66s)]
*  We'll send it back to you. If that, we're just hearing that too, Bill. That is probably the most [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=844.74s)]
*  magnanimous thing any individual in America has done in a long time. After they called him every name under the sign. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=850.18s)]
*  For three years they called him fascist, Hitler. Every day, every panel, there was nobody even to [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=856.1s)]
*  say ever since Harold Ford left that building, there was not one person saying anything nice [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=861.14s)]
*  about Trump. And for him to take that, what is it, breakfast? It just shows you though that he does want, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=866.1800000000001s)]
*  you know, to smooth things over. Maybe he is going to unite our country. And like you said earlier, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=872.26s)]
*  everyone's doing the dances out on the... Hey Bill, when Rachel Maddow shows up at Mar-a-Lago, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=876.9s)]
*  can we make that a Fox News alert? Well, if we can get a camera down there, we'll show it to you guys live. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=882.74s)]
*  All right, thank you very much. All right, so that's interesting. All right, well the president [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=888.42s)]
*  continues to fill out his cabinet, and I know like there's a lot of high profile one like Secretary of [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=893.3s)]
*  State and National Security Advisors coming up a little bit later. Keep your eye on this. It's the [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=897.78s)]
*  FCC chair and a senior Republican on the FCC. He's got a great resume, first nominated back in 2017. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=903.38s)]
*  He's going to focus on censorship, focus on not centering, but censorship, especially on the social [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=910.26s)]
*  media platforms. And when I think it's so significant about this, we already have the exposure. Thanks to [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=916.8199999999999s)]
*  Elon Musk buying Twitter. Yeah, yeah. Their first order of business is going to be getting pro [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=922.9s)]
*  Palestinian voices deported and ensuring that pro Palestinian voices are also silenced on every [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=928.9s)]
*  social media platform. Alarmist Grifter much? You're right. I'm an alarmist Grifter and not [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=935.46s)]
*  someone who is currently the recipient of a coordinated silencing campaign that has [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=941.46s)]
*  literally gotten Congress persons to engage with the platform that I'm on. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=948.02s)]
*  Now there's going to be a focus and all the focus is going to be on Google, on Facebook, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=955.7800000000001s)]
*  and the other behemoths and Snapchat. All the behemoths that are rising have been risen and so [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=962.18s)]
*  dominant as well as their status as a journalistic entity. Are they going to have to give a balanced [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=966.5799999999999s)]
*  perspective when they do? Are they going to have immunity from prosecution and lawsuits when they [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=974.3399999999999s)]
*  defame people? Well, he sent a letter to Apple, Meta, Microsoft, and Alphabet, all of the CEOs, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=978.8199999999999s)]
*  and he's warning them for what he believes is censorship and what he's seen in the past. He said [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=984.26s)]
*  Americans have lived through the unprecedented surge in censorship. Your companies played [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=988.58s)]
*  significant roles in this improper conduct. Right and keep in mind it's only over the last [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=992.6600000000001s)]
*  couple of years where the FCC has had some purview over social media in addition to essentially doing [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=997.7s)]
*  battle with social media companies to try to make sure that it is a free and open place for [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1005.3000000000001s)]
*  people of all political voices to express themselves. Keep in mind he's also going to be [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1012.1800000000001s)]
*  involved in television, which is between radio and television two of the core jobs of the FCC, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1018.82s)]
*  and essentially there have been a number of Republicans who over the last number of years [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1025.06s)]
*  have said that the TV networks have gotten way too liberal. They've got to be back more in the [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1029.8600000000001s)]
*  middle and at least give people on the right a chance. Maybe that's why Mika and Joe went. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1035.3s)]
*  You never know. Self-preservation. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1039.14s)]
*  Yeah. They're like if you don't start, if you don't start actively saying like awful things [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1042.3400000000001s)]
*  about trans people, we will ban you. I'm like what do you mean? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1048.3400000000001s)]
*  Megan Kelly's message to Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski. Go fuck yourselves with dishonest [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1056.0200000000002s)]
*  jokes of fellow journalists. What an absurd force that was. Which one was insincere? He's [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1061.5400000000002s)]
*  Hitler or he's going to speak truth to power and find a way to speaking to working with Donald [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1065.54s)]
*  Trump. Which one was alive? We also let him know that we will continue. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1069.7s)]
*  Ironic because Megan Kelly herself did this exact same grift. To speak truth to power and push back [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1073.22s)]
*  hard when called for. Oh please. As we have with all presidents. Don't be mistaken. We're not here [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1079.3799999999999s)]
*  to defend or normalize Donald Trump. We're here to report on him. I searched for a way to respond [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1087.22s)]
*  appropriately and I called on my 10 years as a litigator in addition to my now 20 as a journalist. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1094.66s)]
*  And I think I found the perfect phrase. Go fuck yourselves. Go Glenn Greenwald. God damn his God, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1099.78s)]
*  his, his fucking, his, his right wing pivot is, is just always gross to see. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1108.5800000000002s)]
*  Oh fuck yourselves. You dishonest jokes of faux journalists. What an absurd farce that was Glenn. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1117.06s)]
*  They, which, which one was insincere? He's Hitler or now we're going to speak truth to power and [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1128.74s)]
*  find a way of speaking to and working with Donald Trump. Which one was a lie? As for us, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1136.9s)]
*  we also let him know that we will continue. Once again, very funny to have Megan Kelly say this [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1143.94s)]
*  when she also, you know, said similar things about Trump. Yeah, but I think it's also, it's also [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1149.54s)]
*  interesting to, to see that when it comes to what happened at SNL, when SNL put Kamau Harris on, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1156.18s)]
*  it didn't put Trump on. What they did is they, they put so much heat on NBC. They say, what can [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1163.14s)]
*  we do for you? And Trump said, and they said, we're going to offer you a spot on NASCAR. And [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1168.02s)]
*  he said, yes. Well, this, this is the guy who put the heat on. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1172.42s)]
*  So it shows you they, they re-reacted and now he's got more power. Yeah. In the meantime, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1177.0600000000002s)]
*  let's talk a little bit. And Bill Mollusian touched on this. We thought by now we would know who the [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1182.02s)]
*  new treasury secretary is, who's going to sign the dollar bill. We thought it was going to be either [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1187.38s)]
*  Howard Ludnick or Scott Bessent. Both of them have been on this program, but then now, now there are [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1192.5800000000002s)]
*  two new names. Kevin Warsh, who has been on the F, has been on the Federal Reserve. And in fact, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1199.46s)]
*  Trump wanted him to be the new Powell, but Powell wound up with the job and that he was regretful [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1205.6200000000001s)]
*  about that. Mark Rowan, a billionaire at Apollo Global. And the backstory is, according to the [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1212.74s)]
*  New York Times, that apparently Howard Ludnick, screen left, who's co-chairing the transition, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1218.1000000000001s)]
*  apparently, he's getting on Trump's nerves. He's hanging around too much. And the people who talked [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1225.78s)]
*  to the Times said he's manipulating the transition to help himself. They said it's like a knife fight [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1232.82s)]
*  between those two screen left with Howard being the aggressive. So now rather than pick one of [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1238.66s)]
*  those two, they're adding two more candidates. Well, Scott was on with Brian. He came on our show [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1245.14s)]
*  last week and Brian interviewed him. And what's interesting is that screen right, Howard Ludnick, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1250.02s)]
*  who's CEO at Canterford, he lost his brother actually in 9 11. And he is the one in charge [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1255.86s)]
*  of the transition team. And he and Linda McMahon, and they've been working on the transition team [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1264.58s)]
*  since I think it was, was it August or was it September? We reported that the day after Trump [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1268.98s)]
*  won. But for a while, they've been working on this transition team. And so he was interviewing Scott [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1273.06s)]
*  Bessett. And then I think he just said, you know what, I might want the job, right? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1277.3s)]
*  We're right to the president. And Scott feels a little bit double crossed. Obviously he was. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1280.6599999999999s)]
*  You're interviewing me, screening me, finding out my pluses and minuses and go down. I'm better. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1285.46s)]
*  So I think Trump's in the middle of it. He's going to expand it. I also heard Lighthizer, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1290.5s)]
*  Robert Lighthizer could be somebody else, a dark horse who Robert Lighthizer has this rare thing. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1294.5s)]
*  He was saluted consistently by Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, and President Trump. He was unbelievable [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1300.26s)]
*  with the trade deals he pulled off. Everyone focuses on China, but he did a ton of them, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1307.54s)]
*  including redoing USMCA. So that's somebody to keep in mind too. So he's going to, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1311.14s)]
*  he'll be named shortly. Also interesting, Ben Carson's name's coming up again. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1316.42s)]
*  And what is he going to do? Is he going to be HUD again? And I don't think so. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1320.26s)]
*  Well, he said he wasn't going to, he wasn't going to be a part of the cabinet. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1323.38s)]
*  Well, no, he put out on Twitter that he will not be surgeon general, but he is apparently going to [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1326.26s)]
*  be speaking to the former and future presidents shortly about how he can help. The interesting [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1332.9s)]
*  thing about Howard Lutnick is, and this is one of the core things that Trump ran on, tariffs. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1338.74s)]
*  Howard is a hundred percent behind some sort of tariff movement. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1345.7s)]
*  Both of them are. Howard, you think Howard, I thought he was late to that party. I thought he was [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1350.26s)]
*  more traditional. When he was here about three weeks ago, we talked a lot about [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1355.38s)]
*  tariffs and he is completely behind. And I was reading that both of them are for Trump's tariffs, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1361.14s)]
*  trade tariff policies, and Bessette even said tariffs are a means to finally stand up for [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1366.5800000000002s)]
*  Americans. It's leverage. You go up, hey, unless you come to the table, a hundred percent tariffs [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1371.0600000000002s)]
*  on this and they're all going to focus on China, which I think could get Democrats and Republicans [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1375.0600000000002s)]
*  both together on that. And Lutnick said, for my whole life, I was a fiscal conservative, social [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1379.46s)]
*  liberal. The Democratic Party moved away from me. I think a lot of people can relate to that. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1384.26s)]
*  Well, he's going to, Trump's going to talk to the two new candidates this week, maybe by Friday. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1388.5s)]
*  We'll know who the guy is who's going to sign the money. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1393.46s)]
*  And I'm Ainsley. We also need to ask Liz Miller what she thinks about all this. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1398.42s)]
*  The newly minted Department of Government Efficiency Doge expected to lob a shattering [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1402.18s)]
*  blow at federal bureaucracy and redundancies. Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy both tapped as co-leaders. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1407.3s)]
*  Listen to this. Over half a trillion dollars that's spent every year right now was not even [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1412.98s)]
*  authorized by Congress in the first place. They can't even tell you where it goes. We've talked [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1419.22s)]
*  a big game for 40 years about cutting the federal government, about reducing the scope of the federal [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1423.54s)]
*  government. Politicians haven't been able to do it. And so Elon and I were not politicians. We're [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1427.54s)]
*  businessmen. We're coming at it from the outside. Mr. Wonderful, Kevin O'Leary is the chairman of [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1432.26s)]
*  O'Leary Ventures and he joins us now. So Kevin, back in 2010, the Simpson-Bowles Commission proved [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1437.22s)]
*  that it's not hard to find waste, fraud, and abuse in places to cut spending. What's hard is [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1442.42s)]
*  getting Congress to go through with it. Is that going to be any different this time around? [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1448.18s)]
*  Yes, it will be different. What Bowles didn't have at that time was the megaphone Elon Musk has. You [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1452.5800000000002s)]
*  gotta remember, politicians have to raise money. These days they do it using social media. Now, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1458.74s)]
*  what Elon has, if people keep forgetting, because they say, well, he doesn't have a legislative [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1464.5s)]
*  mandate here, and I say, oh, he's got better than that. He's got X. So what happens is you're [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1468.34s)]
*  in some state somewhere and you own a project to nothing and you're spending $2 billion, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1474.58s)]
*  he just will shame you out. He'll start naming to all of your voters exactly what you've done wrong [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1480.34s)]
*  and what you're not doing to fix it. And I love that. Considering the objectively anti-science [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1486.1s)]
*  slant that the megaphone carriers have taken alongside Robert F. Kennedy Jr., they're not [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1491.3799999999999s)]
*  going to go after old ass, like corrupt projects within the public-private partnership that exists. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1497.22s)]
*  And there are many such examples of this. I am after all living in California, which is one of the [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1503.54s)]
*  number one states where this happens with regular frequency. They are instead going to complain [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1509.7s)]
*  about scientists spending money on silly shit that turns out not to be silly at all. The concept of [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1514.26s)]
*  just squeezing heads to stop waste, because all he has to do is turn on the machine. Now, [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1521.46s)]
*  it's going to be very contingent. I've said this multiple times about this mandate. The power he [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1527.6200000000001s)]
*  has is not to be underestimated, because if you can get to the voter of that governor or that senator [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1531.78s)]
*  that's wasting money in his eyes and he can make a good case on X, you're going to cause a lot of [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1538.1000000000001s)]
*  damage in that constituency. And I love this idea because it's a negotiation. That's what it is. If [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1544.9s)]
*  you don't fix this, I'm going to call you out. The $44 billion he spent on X might seem like a [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1550.9s)]
*  bargain in the long run if he gets to leverage it like that. Here's a breakdown of federal spending, [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1555.5400000000002s)]
*  just so that folks at home know where their tax dollars are going. Healthcare, 25 percent. Social [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1560.3400000000001s)]
*  Security, 20 to 25 percent. Defense, 13 to 15 percent. Safety net programs, 10 percent. Interest [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1564.74s)]
*  on the national debt, 8 to 10 percent. The way it breaks down is 61 percent of spending is mandatory. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1570.98s)]
*  13 percent is on debt service. 26 percent is discretionary, which really will be the target [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1576.66s)]
*  of Doge. And that is a small piece of the pie to try to wring $2 trillion out of, Kevin. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1582.98s)]
*  I don't know. I think healthcare could be another place of savings. We haven't really used any [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1589.46s)]
*  technology there yet. We haven't really digitized medical records. We really haven't brought a [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1593.8600000000001s)]
*  mandate of AI into that. I think we could save a lot. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1597.38s)]
*  We should cut some of that Medicare spending, dude. That's a good area of improvement. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1627.38s)]
*  Fucking demon. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1631.6200000000001s)]
*  A lot of money. The US has one of the worst IRR returns on healthcare spending when you can [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1632.2600000000002s)]
*  compare it to some of the European countries like Switzerland or England or France. They do a much [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1638.5s)]
*  better job, but they share the- [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1642.5800000000002s)]
*  I wonder why. Bro, that's crazy. Was shit this crazy back in 2016? No, because in 2016, Donald [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1645.46s)]
*  Trump didn't even know he was going to fucking become president. So the chaos of his transition [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1653.3s)]
*  was somewhat beneficial. This time he is, he's been in that position. He knows what to do. He [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1660.8999999999999s)]
*  knows what not to do. It's so frustrating that Republicans routinely point to the same exact [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1665.94s)]
*  problems that we address and we point to on this broadcast. And then their advocacy is to cripple [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1673.78s)]
*  it further. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1679.86s)]
*  The records on a much more ubiquitous basis that we do, we're always concerned about privacy, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1680.66s)]
*  but I think we could fix that too. But I like looking at everything. I don't see any reason [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1685.8600000000001s)]
*  why these two can't just release the hounds and go nuts. Everybody's interested to find out what [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1689.94s)]
*  they're going to see. And I'd like to hear it myself because maybe it's a means test on social [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1695.6200000000001s)]
*  security. We have to fix this because the deficit's getting a little big right now and the [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1700.18s)]
*  bond market's starting to get a little bit uneasy in the 10 year. I worry about that. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1706.1s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, there's no question that social security is something that might need to be looked [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1710.8999999999999s)]
*  at. But Simpson-Bowles said, let's look at that. And Republicans in Congress said, nope, not going [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1716.5s)]
*  to touch that. So Elon Musk is having no end of fun with all of this. America, his pack, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1720.74s)]
*  produced this tweet saying, quote, the Pentagon just failed its seventh audit in a row. The [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1727.3s)]
*  nation's largest government agency is unable to fully account for its budget of over $824 billion. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1731.62s)]
*  They don't even know where billions of taxpayers' money is going. Efficiency is coming, [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1736.8999999999999s)]
*  to which Musk retweeted with a comment, sounds like a job for Doge. I mean, he really looks like he's [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1740.9799999999998s)]
*  looking forward to getting into the numbers here. I rest my case, Your Honor. Here he goes. He's [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1746.8999999999999s)]
*  just going to keep on these guys, hitting him every day to a billion people that are willing to listen [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1752.58s)]
*  and the head squeezing begins. I love head squeezing. This is fantastic. They're going [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1757.3799999999999s)]
*  to think he's going to go away. No, he won't. He'll just keep going and going and going and [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1762.26s)]
*  going and no one's going to stop him. He owns the network. We've never had anything quite like this [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1766.18s)]
*  and I absolutely love it. This is terrific. All right. Well, we'll see if they can ring that money [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1770.18s)]
*  out of the federal budget. It'll be something to watch. Kevin, great to catch up with you. Thank [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1775.06s)]
*  you, sir. You won't believe this. MSNBC morning Joe co-host and vicious Donald Trump critics [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1778.5s)]
*  revealed this morning that they met with president-elect Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Friday [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1784.5s)]
*  morning. They did this after conceding that voters overwhelmingly had made their choice. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1790.34s)]
*  We were given the opportunity to do just that. Joe and I went to Mar-a-Lago to meet personally [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1796.1s)]
*  with president-elect Trump. It was the first time we have seen him in seven years. And it's going [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1804.26s)]
*  to come as no surprise to anybody who watches this show has watched it over the past year or [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1811.86s)]
*  over the past decade that we didn't see eye to eye on a lot of issues. And we told him so. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1818.74s)]
*  What we did agree on was to restart communications. In this meeting, president Trump was tearful. He [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1825.2199999999998s)]
*  was upbeat. He seemed interested in finding common ground with Democrats on some of the most divisive [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1831.4599999999998s)]
*  issues. And for those asking why we would go speak to the president-elect during such fraught [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1838.74s)]
*  times, especially between us, I guess I would ask back, why wouldn't we? So why wouldn't you meet [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1845.3s)]
*  with Donald Trump? I'm thinking really hard. Well, maybe here's why. These are your own words. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1853.38s)]
*  The retweeting of neo-Nazi videos, Charlottesville. I mean, I could go on and on what he said about [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1858.82s)]
*  majority black countries. That is tearing more at the fabric of America than attacks on the twin [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1866.1s)]
*  towers did. We rebuilt from that. We became stronger because of that. But this seems to me [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1872.6599999999999s)]
*  a far graver threat to the idea of America. If Republicans continue this line of thinking, [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1879.62s)]
*  if they continue their support for Donald Trump, they needn't fool themselves. A second Trump [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1884.82s)]
*  administration would destroy the Department of Justice, would destroy the FBI. This is not a [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1891.54s)]
*  reach. I could go back and talk about. Remember what I told you when liberals capitulate the [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1898.8999999999999s)]
*  right-wing framing or just like capitulate the right-wingers in general? All Republicans have [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1903.7s)]
*  to do is go look at how hypocritical these fucking idiots are. And they're right. They are right. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1908.8999999999999s)]
*  You cannot consistently say Donald Trump is a fucking fascist and then turn around and be like, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1915.14s)]
*  and we're friends with that fascist again. You either, A, don't believe he was a fascist at all [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1922.26s)]
*  and just lied to your audience, which is what the argument Republicans make. Or B, the argument I [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1927.46s)]
*  make, you actually think that he is a threat to American democracy. You just don't want him to be [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1933.38s)]
*  a threat to you. You don't have a problem with the fascism. Nazi Germany. And I do it, I do it [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1938.9s)]
*  without any concerns whatsoever. And if people can't start drawing the parallels, well, you're [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1945.3000000000002s)]
*  just stupid or you have your head in the sand or you're one of them. When you look at a Republican [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1950.1000000000001s)]
*  nominee, a potential Republican nominee, that's talking about terminating the constitution, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1956.42s)]
*  he said, terminate the constitution, arrest political opponents using the justice department, [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1961.3000000000002s)]
*  uh, uh, assassinate generals that weren't sufficiently politically loyal to him saying that he was going [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1968.98s)]
*  to take the FCC and bring it in to the White House. And he would decide what networks were on and what [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1977.9399999999998s)]
*  networks were not on. Lisa, I unfortunately saw that last one in real time. He literally said [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1985.62s)]
*  Donald Trump would assassinate generals and use SEAL Team 6. And now you're going to go meet with [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1993.14s)]
*  him? Sorry, you're both phonies. I'm like, I can't get over this story, right? I don't think any of [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=1998.74s)]
*  us can. It's like, how does this call go? Right? Like, Oh, hey, Don, okay. So I'm sorry I called [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2004.5s)]
*  you a Nazi for years and like Hitler, but you want to grab coffee, maybe lunch, you know, like [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2009.46s)]
*  your house. Yeah. Like how does it, it's like funny because it's so ridiculous and it's so [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2014.5800000000002s)]
*  shameless and it's so debasing and so disgusting on their part. But they also created this [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2020.18s)]
*  environment where Donald Trump almost got killed. Right. And even back in October, Mika Brzezinski [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2024.3400000000001s)]
*  said that the Madison Square Garden was a white nationalist Nazi type rally. And so they're the [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2029.8600000000001s)]
*  ones that created that environment. And so it is good to see that MSNBC's ratings are down. And [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2035.46s)]
*  that's why they're doing this. Hopefully they can eat some humble pie, maybe do some self-reflection [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2040.5s)]
*  and realize that they have led to a lot of the division in this country and an environment that [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2044.66s)]
*  potentially got Donald Trump killed. You know, Mika Brzezinski went on The View and basically [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2048.5s)]
*  took over the show. It was like the Mika Brzezinski show that day. Well, now Sonny [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2052.5s)]
*  Hostin is very angry. Watch. Uh oh. I think that we have to be very clear-eyed when we [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2056.42s)]
*  think about the president-elect and cover the president-elect. And I don't think you need to [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2063.78s)]
*  sit down for 90 minutes at Mar-a-Lago and kiss his ring. Yo, I think Sonny is actively, [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2067.7s)]
*  actively getting radicalized. I'm not even kidding. Like every time I see a clip, [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2077.54s)]
*  she's just like surrounded by some of the most annoying assholes. And there's like consistently [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2081.8599999999997s)]
*  a voice for a reason on the panel. It's not even a joke. Every time I hear The View, it's like [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2087.62s)]
*  annoying nonsensical centrist bullshit, annoying nonsensical right-wing bullshit, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2093.2999999999997s)]
*  vague generalizations, aesthetically posturing towards progress, crying, chirping old ladies, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2098.8999999999996s)]
*  whatever. And then Sonny will just like pop the fuck off and be like, you know, we must not rely [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2104.42s)]
*  on the magnanimous nature of capital owners because they will never give us a crumb of power that they [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2110.42s)]
*  hold for themselves. You know, revolution now revolution tomorrow. You have nothing to lose, [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2116.26s)]
*  but your chains. I'm like, where did this come from? Why are you saying these things? It's crazy. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2121.2200000000003s)]
*  To be able to speak truth and to be able to cover a story. So maybe they're not [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2126.1800000000003s)]
*  journalists in the true sense. Maybe they're saying that they're opinion general journalists. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2132.18s)]
*  I mean, here she just said maybe Mika is not a journalist. You think? Well, I mean, make MSNBC [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2136.8199999999997s)]
*  great again. Yeah, maybe that's what they're trying to do. Look at the ratings are no joke. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2142.3399999999997s)]
*  And networks can think of it as being cyclical. So this cycle started last Wednesday morning after [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2146.8999999999996s)]
*  the election and they're feeling it now. But I just don't understand where they are going to go [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2151.8599999999997s)]
*  forward and not admit that they lied because if they really thought he was a fascist, a Nazi, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2158.66s)]
*  and he was getting at Trump supporters with those comments about MSNBC or MSG, the Madison Square [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2163.7s)]
*  Guard. No, I'm not going to lie. It's just like it's worse. I think they just don't care. I think [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2169.7799999999997s)]
*  they don't care about Trump's fascism. That's it. Like I think that they were, I think that they [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2175.38s)]
*  genuinely want to be insulated from the harms that Trump's fascism will inevitably cause [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2181.86s)]
*  American society. They know where society is going. And they want in on it. They want in on [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2187.78s)]
*  the action. They don't want to be fucking harmed in the process. That's what I think truly 100%. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2192.9s)]
*  Trump loves this shit, by the way, he will 100% demonstrate humility and grace, false humility and [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2199.78s)]
*  false grace his entire life. His entire life has been desperately seeking out the approval of [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2205.6200000000003s)]
*  dipshits like this. They were friends with Donald Trump. They were originally friends. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2212.58s)]
*  Donald Trump has said horrible things about them. Horrible things about Mika Brzezinski, [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2217.7799999999997s)]
*  horrible things about Joe Scarborough. After these assholes were so friendly with him. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2222.1s)]
*  I'm telling you right now, notice how they're not talking about how this makes Trump a hypocrite. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2229.14s)]
*  No, first of all, Trump is God. He can't get, he can't be hypocritical. Okay. And number two, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2232.66s)]
*  the easiest answer to that is what do you mean? He's the president. He's going to unite the country [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2237.2999999999997s)]
*  and this is him uniting the country. Trump says media is vital to making America great again. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2241.54s)]
*  Vows to work with a fair, free and open press. Oh my God. Yeah. What the fuck is this? Since rabbits [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2245.54s)]
*  cannot bark or meow, they may nip to communicate. This communication may be telling you to put them [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2250.34s)]
*  down or even pet them more. It's a way to get your attention. And it usually works. They may nudge or [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2254.42s)]
*  dig at you first. And if that does not get the desired effect, the nip is next. Thanks. Extra [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2259.14s)]
*  fruit jam, no glaze, but the level of pushback you receive for telling the truth is shocking to me [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2264.5s)]
*  considering how few there are fighting for the left perspective to have space to be heard. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2268.18s)]
*  I would have lost my mind and had not been for you and few others on this platform. The reality [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2272.74s)]
*  is too brutal to face and remain unscathed. And I hate that I have to stand back and watch it unfold. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2275.8599999999997s)]
*  I mean, I have to stand back. That's why I say organize. As everyone knows, I have thousands of [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2280.18s)]
*  criticisms of Trump, but at the Young Turks, we also give credit where credit is due and have done [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2284.1s)]
*  that from day one. There's one thing Trump is excellent at letting bygones be bygones. He has [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2287.46s)]
*  done that from morning Joe to Lindsey Graham, by the way, the same Democrats who would get mad at [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2291.7s)]
*  us for saying Trump's criminal justice reform bill was pretty good. And he never said blood bath in [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2295.86s)]
*  a physical sense. And he was heroic out to the shooting, et cetera. The one scouring scurrying [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2299.86s)]
*  to get meetings with him and kiss his ring. Now shaky, shaky, Gerga. There is no reason to hand [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2303.94s)]
*  it to Donald Trump in this instance. He's just literally flexing his power. He's getting people [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2309.38s)]
*  to kiss the ring. People that he once was friends with Trump does not let bygones be bygones. He's [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2316.26s)]
*  just always wanted. He's just always wanted to get the favor of these liberal elites. That's where [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2322.1s)]
*  a lot of his resentment against the by coast elites come from. It's repackaged in a way that is more [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2328.42s)]
*  appropriate for like the average American to care about, but that's where his like anger and resentment [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2333.86s)]
*  comes from that like liberal elites have always thought of him of two, like a two crass, two rude. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2339.14s)]
*  They never really welcomed him into the old money circles that he wanted to be in. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2347.62s)]
*  Pardon crowd calling supporters Nazis and so on and so forth. Look, they have to admit they lied [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2352.18s)]
*  before they can go forth. Like I'll never believe another word that they say. And by the way, that's [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2358.18s)]
*  more MSNBC. Those clips who showed that I've seen in years. I mean, that was a lot of material. I [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2363.2999999999997s)]
*  don't, you know, I try not to have that much of it in my system. I think I might be allergic to it. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2369.06s)]
*  That's good for your mental health. So that's probably a wise decision. I'm sure they're nice [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2374.02s)]
*  people, but they're like, John, you know, the fact that Trump took this meeting, [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCaf4TQok&t=2377.14s)]
