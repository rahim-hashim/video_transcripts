*  So that way we have access to information quickly as it calms in. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=0.0s)]
*  I like what you're saying, except I do still maintain the position that League of Legends [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=5.28s)]
*  is responsible for the Bedlam here. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=10.72s)]
*  It's gonna put us in a strategic mindset in case people are eating, people are shopping, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=13.76s)]
*  or Marvel rivals. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=19.36s)]
*  But obviously it's now within the evacuation... [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=20.64s)]
*  I'm gonna see if we can make it this way and show you some of the homes. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=28.0s)]
*  I know that there's an area here that was completely one of the streets. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=30.72s)]
*  Alright, I'm back. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=33.84s)]
*  We're back. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  Looked like, uh, I wanna make sure we clear everything and we're not in any danger with [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=35.92s)]
*  any of this stuff. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=40.64s)]
*  Holy moly, we're back. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=41.6s)]
*  Um... [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=44.56s)]
*  Alright, here we go. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=45.2s)]
*  This is again, we just turned onto another side street. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=46.08s)]
*  And you can see all of this damage. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=49.440000000000005s)]
*  Sorry that there wasn't the best footage possible there when we were, when I was driving [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=52.96s)]
*  and stuff, but I didn't have a second hand to... [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=58.56s)]
*  That side. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=61.040000000000006s)]
*  Turn over here. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=68.4s)]

*  You can't be out here being like, yo, you're not in the Hills. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=156.95999999999998s)]
*  What a location for us to look at. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=158.88s)]
*  Guys, we've got some great news. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=162.0s)]
*  Fire engine from Santa Monica fire department showed up and they put out the flames of this [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=163.76000000000002s)]
*  home. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  Not only that, but they saved the home next door. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  So where this was fully engulfed just a short time ago, the flames are almost entirely put [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=171.84s)]
*  out. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=177.52s)]
*  Nothing is one of the last images that the UC San Diego cameras capture before it went [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=177.68s)]
*  offline. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  Jesus Christ of that imminent, the Topanga Canyon camera has some crazy imagery. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=181.68s)]
*  Cleared this firefighters are now cleaning up. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=188.48000000000002s)]
*  They're wrapping up their hoses and you can see another firefighter coming out from between [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=191.44s)]
*  these two homes here. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=194.64s)]
*  This is such great news. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=196.72s)]
*  And what looked like it could have been yet another disaster has been averted. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  Great work. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=202.96s)]
*  And this is, am I crazy or am I crazy? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=203.68s)]
*  Or is it wild to me that people are like, there is a limited number of hands readily [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  available to help people. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=214.32s)]
*  And in that, in that situation, like there are still cops that are instead of working [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=216.16s)]
*  on recovery and relief efforts, they're literally working on like defending homes from freaking [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=220.48s)]
*  looters. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=224.95999999999998s)]
*  Like I feel like that is, I feel like that is genuinely a crazy situation. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=225.35999999999999s)]
*  We got to, we got to make it collect wildlife. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  This is so devastating prayers for all affected. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=233.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=241.12s)]
*  Cops are out there. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=241.35999999999999s)]
*  Cops are out there shooting the fires. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=242.72s)]
*  That's what they're doing. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=244.32s)]
*  Anyway, Fox 11 still has Haley above the Hollywood fire. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=246.0s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=248.95999999999998s)]
*  And November, it was one fire to focus on primarily here. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=250.64s)]
*  We have so many fires across the area and even those fires and Alex, you mentioned this [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=253.51999999999998s)]
*  earlier, it's like the, the sunset fire. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=258.15999999999997s)]
*  It's not like it's one spot. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=259.76s)]
*  It's just several, like a cluster of fires kind of in a general area. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=260.8s)]
*  I can't imagine how they, how they strategize going about this, but I will say, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=264.8s)]
*  well, it was on our road, about to burn down this dude, spray down airline air attack these [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=269.36s)]
*  over the course of the night tonight. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=274.88s)]
*  I was saying that we're seeing a live water drop. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=276.15999999999997s)]
*  So great timing there, Adam. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=278.56s)]
*  Thank you for such a thorough report and forecasting. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=280.24s)]
*  That was at last goes there on your screen for a moment, but we want to give some new [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=283.92s)]
*  information about the sunset fire. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=287.04s)]
*  Bro, that is crazy. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=288.8s)]
*  The mandatory evacuation now includes the Dolby theater, El Capitan entertainment center. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=291.12s)]
*  And that's an L for black boy, Max. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=296.8s)]

*  Okay. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=306.64s)]
*  I knew that there was a point today where I would have to potentially evacuate. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=306.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=313.03999999999996s)]

*  while I'm also, you know, while I'm also trying to make sure that my family is safe. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=345.59999999999997s)]

*  Exactly. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=392.64s)]
*  All I'm saying is I set it up ahead of time. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=393.2s)]
*  So I knew that if I had to like, you know, leave instantly, I could still continue [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=395.12s)]
*  filming the journey you think, but you don't want to be walking on the highway. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=402.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=408.64s)]

*  I'll bring with me. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=415.68s)]
*  So it's fine. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=416.56s)]
*  Your fans are taking you seriously again. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=418.08s)]
*  It's so stupid. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=419.59999999999997s)]

*  Bro, you need to be saved, not get a clip. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=437.28s)]
*  Sometimes a clip is more important than the safety. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=442.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=448.72s)]
*  Sometimes I'm looking at all the fires and my heart just breaks. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=450.72s)]
*  I'm literally in tears. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=455.92s)]
*  It's apocalyptic looking out here and seeing everyone looking out. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=457.04s)]
*  I gotta go P real quick on the hillside and we have over a hundred beds ready right now. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=461.2s)]
*  I mean, literally all night long, we'll be there at the desk, ready to take anybody in [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=466.88s)]
*  two, three, oh one Bellevue Avenue, Los Angeles, California. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=471.36s)]
*  I mean, we're just here to serve. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=474.64s)]
*  We've been here for 30 years and I've never been more heartbroken. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=476.0s)]
*  I've never been more saddened to see, you know, I can care less about the fact that [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=479.12s)]
*  I've been displaced. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=483.36s)]
*  You know, really I'm in my office and my family, my dogs, everyone I'm looking at the fire [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=484.24s)]
*  and watching you guys and I'm just in absolute tears. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=489.2s)]
*  And all we want to do is provide solutions. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=492.24s)]
*  And we got great hospital old hospital rooms that we use for all our young volunteers that [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=494.56s)]
*  come, you know, in the summer to serve, but it's already ready to go. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=500.4s)]
*  We got free meals a day, showers, room, everything. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=502.96s)]
*  We just want to love on LA and take in anyone that's in need. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=506.0s)]
*  And just be there for this city that has just been so, so kind to us. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=509.36s)]
*  And we've hopefully been kind of returned, but we just, we're ready. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=513.28s)]
*  We're able, we're willing. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=517.12s)]
*  We have the infrastructure in place and we're ready to go. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=518.32s)]
*  Pastor, sorry, are you saying that you yourself are an evacuee as well? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=521.44s)]
*  Yeah, I'm by the Alta Dena fire. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=525.76s)]
*  I've been by power for 30 hours or so. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=528.48s)]
*  And so I, I'm kind of the displaced helping the displaced, but that's kind of the LA spirit. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=531.2s)]
*  And your home is okay as far as you know? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=537.6800000000001s)]
*  So far, you never know if these winds changing, you know, but yeah, so far so good. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=540.72s)]
*  And I'm just here and, and really all my, my eyes are all on the mission right now. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=546.5600000000001s)]
*  And that is just kind of being there for such a time as this. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=551.2s)]
*  And I just look at the fire. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=554.48s)]
*  I can't believe I'm seeing this hillside right now. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=555.6s)]
*  Well, and that's absolutely stunning. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=557.44s)]
*  Let's talk about that because, you know, this fire, not all that far from you. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=559.0400000000001s)]
*  Are you worried that you may have to evacuate the Dream Center? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=564.32s)]
*  Any indication of that? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=567.44s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=570.48s)]
*  I can't imagine it getting as far, but I think it could. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=572.8000000000001s)]
*  I mean, I think all those things are out the window now, the way these things are flying around. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=575.6s)]
*  But we're going to stay here as long as we possibly can. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=579.84s)]
*  We're going to push the envelope as long as we can to be here for people. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=583.36s)]
*  And so we're taking the scream out of here because that's, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=586.4s)]
*  we were born for this day of adversity and we were born for this season. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=590.16s)]
*  And then we just, you know, feeding people all day today, nine to five coming by because people, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=593.76s)]
*  you know, can't go to work and losing a little bit of extra income and offsetting it by going [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=598.8s)]
*  to our food line that's open from nine to five every day and just giving groceries. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=603.28s)]
*  So it's the best thing we could do is just throw every resource that we've had over 30 years. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=607.8399999999999s)]
*  The LA has allowed us to have by their kindness and generosity [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=613.6s)]
*  and just making ourselves available. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=616.9599999999999s)]
*  There's no, like you, 20, seven hours a day on the air. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=619.04s)]
*  There's no like clock pushing or anything like that. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=623.4399999999999s)]
*  There's no like punching and punching out. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=625.92s)]
*  It's just, it's all hands on deck, all hours of the day, all the time. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=628.0s)]
*  You know, we've been in touch with one of your colleagues, Clint Carlton, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=631.76s)]
*  who had reached out to me when we first needed evacuation centers and said, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=636.8s)]
*  hey, the Dream Center is open. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=640.48s)]
*  So we have been providing that information to our viewers now for well over 24 hours. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=642.3199999999999s)]
*  Did you in fact see some evacuees from any of these fires? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=648.16s)]
*  Have you taken some in thus far? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=652.0s)]
*  Oh, yes, we have. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=654.4s)]
*  We've taken many and we've had one family lost our entire house. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=655.28s)]
*  They came in, they lost everything. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=659.4399999999999s)]
*  We've had individuals come in. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=661.8399999999999s)]
*  We have people calling now. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=663.36s)]
*  I mean, I really believe by tomorrow, all 108 of those beds will be filled. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=664.8s)]
*  And the good thing about it is we'll just be there for them however long it takes. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=668.64s)]
*  That's the whole dream center. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=672.24s)]
*  We get people the luxury of time to really take their time to rebuild their life properly. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=673.1999999999999s)]
*  I think reality is setting in the first few hours. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=678.8000000000001s)]
*  It was a little slower, but now day two, we're getting tons of calls. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=681.12s)]
*  People are coming in now like crazy. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=684.4s)]
*  Reality is setting in there. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=687.12s)]
*  Maybe they just might not be able to go back for a while or come back to anything anymore. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=688.32s)]
*  Well, if people want to help or get more information on what you guys do, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=694.64s)]

*  It's now been cut off there, but we see some of those engines over driving around a lot of red [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=814.3199999999999s)]
*  flashing lights. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=819.12s)]
*  They're trying to save that building as the flames are getting dangerously close on the [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=820.0s)]
*  eastern side of that flank of the fire. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=824.9599999999999s)]
*  They've already lost by my count about three or four homes there in the last hour, hour [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=827.12s)]
*  and a half as many of these active fires continue to burn in the palisades. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=830.7199999999999s)]
*  We say structure protection up there, but we don't know if they have any water. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=834.8s)]
*  Remember at that press conference a couple of hours ago, the head of LADWP saying that [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=838.0799999999999s)]
*  three large water tanks they depend on here in the palisades. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=842.16s)]
*  She claimed war fill full capacity as the fire broke out, but then. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=846.4s)]
*  Basically, sure evaporating off the Pacific Ocean and moving inland. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=853.6s)]
*  And right now that is one of the ingredients that we need to help the firefighters and the [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=858.72s)]
*  water dropping helicopters and the Foss check dropping so that we increase the moisture [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=865.52s)]
*  and of course the vegetation. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=872.3199999999999s)]
*  More importantly, it's still very, very dry at the surface. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=874.24s)]
*  So it's going to be a long haul to actually get there, but at least that is a sign of [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=878.08s)]
*  improvement. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=882.8s)]
*  We're going to see more of that tomorrow afternoon, but unfortunately tomorrow, late [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=883.52s)]
*  afternoon, early evening, it looks like we are going. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=888.24s)]
*  Oh, the, this one, dude, look at this sunset fire caught its first home and it appears [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=890.88s)]
*  a resident came out of the home, extinguished the flames and CBS filmed it all live. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=897.44s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=901.44s)]
*  Dude, imagine your imagine what? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=902.32s)]
*  Imagine your, your balcony is on fire and just like bust out with a fire extinguisher. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=908.4000000000001s)]
*  I mean, I got to imagine my balcony on fire. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=912.88s)]
*  Yeah, I have one back there. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=918.72s)]
*  I have a little baby fire. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=919.7600000000001s)]
*  I will be fine. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=921.44s)]
*  Please stay safe. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=925.2800000000001s)]
*  There's a, wait, what? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=926.48s)]
*  There's a threat on West Hollywood now. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=929.2s)]
*  No, there isn't. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=931.2800000000001s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=931.92s)]
*  Running candy is on fire. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=932.56s)]
*  I've never seen anything like this born and raised in LA. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=933.52s)]
*  All the West Hollywood Hollywood is now under threat. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=935.1999999999999s)]
*  Hollywood is a West Hollywood was under threat. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=937.68s)]
*  Why? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=939.36s)]
*  Because that guy said it. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=939.5999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I'm good. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=941.68s)]
*  I think we're going to, I think we're going to wait on, you know, official confirmation [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=942.56s)]
*  considering that where I'm at right now is not even a secondary is not even like [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=948.56s)]
*  in a secondary evacuation zone where like you need to prepare for evacuation. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=952.7199999999999s)]
*  I'll be all right. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=956.64s)]
*  You know, a guy said it. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=957.4399999999999s)]
*  At 6 PM on Twitter. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=962.0799999999999s)]
*  So also the problem that area, that area is like, right. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=964.0799999999999s)]
*  It's like both Hollywood and West Hollywood. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=971.68s)]
*  That's why people are saying that Hollywood is massive and West Hollywood is massive. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=974.0s)]
*  Hey, Bartleto. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=980.24s)]
*  Is that right now or [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=991.92s)]
*  Yeah, there's just a aerial views and stuff. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1001.4399999999999s)]
*  Wait, this is kind of funny. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1004.24s)]
*  I just realized the LA reporters on the ground during live shots are increasingly discussing [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1005.68s)]
*  themselves and the difficulty processing the fires, making comments about that fires near [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1009.1999999999999s)]
*  my family. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1012.24s)]
*  So I'm paying really close attention to that one. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1012.64s)]
*  It's been two days of this. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1014.56s)]
*  It's just a lot. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1015.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's really, it's really interesting. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1016.9599999999999s)]
*  When it's your home. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1020.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1022.72s)]
*  Those very same war correspondence when they go to Gaza. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1024.24s)]
*  Well, they don't go to Gaza. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1027.44s)]
*  They go to Tel Aviv and talk about all of the, you know, destroyed houses very differently. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1028.56s)]
*  Now, of course I still obviously have sympathy for people that are, you know, directly in the [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1035.76s)]
*  crosshairs of this natural disaster, but I also have sympathy for, you know, people directly in [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1040.4s)]
*  the crosshairs of another thing that is not a natural disaster, but a manmade form of violence, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1045.52s)]
*  Israel's violence in Gaza. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1050.0s)]
*  So that's just like really interesting to think about, you know, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1051.84s)]
*  have you tried Dr. Pepper strawberries and creams, zero sugar soda? What are you? [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1058.0s)]
*  Look at this. I'm literally drinking that right now. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1063.2s)]
*  We were previously warning about the fire coming into the city via Santa Monica or via the hills [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1067.52s)]
*  in Santa Monica. Now, would you even be more worried about this new fire could come into [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1072.0s)]
*  the city via Hollywood and West Hollywood is very concerning is what they're saying on ABC seven. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1074.88s)]
*  This is where the fire is right now. It is burning in this direction. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1078.8000000000002s)]
*  If I expand out even further, they're saying in the worst case scenario, it might [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1083.44s)]
*  right here and look at the homes that are along. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1086.88s)]
*  Let's say hypothetically, if this fire continues to burn in this direction, which is where it's [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1090.16s)]
*  going, look at everything that's in its way from these big properties, but getting down to Kershen, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1095.2s)]
*  then you start getting into this massive amount of a populated area. And for perspective, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1101.1999999999998s)]
*  we talked to you about Hollywood and Highland. I'm going to move the map over right over here [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1107.52s)]
*  is let me expand out a little bit more. There's Highland and Hollywood Boulevard is right here. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1114.0s)]
*  So the fire is here. It's burning in this direction and all of this populated area, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1118.8799999999999s)]
*  Hollywood Boulevard, Sunset Boulevard, Highland, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1124.96s)]
*  Avenue going up and down. All of this could be in danger. Chris, I'm going to throw it back to you. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1128.16s)]
*  And was there public announcements about like fire risk in the days before the windstorm? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1132.88s)]
*  Does somebody just not listen? Wait, what do you mean? They did say that there's going to be some [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1137.52s)]
*  really, there's going to be a lot of winds which can open itself up to a risk of potential wildfires. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1143.28s)]
*  But notice how everyone on television is saying, this is historic. This is historic. This has never [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1150.8s)]
*  happened before. That's because this is historic and that people did not suspect it ever to get [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1157.2s)]
*  to this degree. Normally there are areas that are prone for wildfires. Okay. Every year during wildfire [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1163.04s)]
*  season, you know exactly which areas are high risk of wildfires view from behind the Runyon fire, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1169.68s)]
*  looking towards the city an hour ago. I cannot believe that we watched this when it was literally [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1178.24s)]
*  like this big. It's insane how fast like when it was a blip, the first thing I did was like, oh my [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1185.36s)]
*  God, like the first thing I did was hit you guys up and that was like, it was like this much. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1190.56s)]
*  And now a couple hours later, it's because it's so fucking dry. It's so dry and you know, the [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1196.64s)]
*  combination with the winds and I, it was literally two small spot fires and look at it now. This is [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1203.6s)]
*  from an hour ago too. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1210.8s)]
*  That's on a song. Look at the Joe Rogan tweet from about a year ago about some firefighter claiming [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1221.6799999999998s)]
*  that this will happen because LA is too dry to handle this. It is insane. Yeah. I mean, that's, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1224.9599999999998s)]
*  that's, that's, you know, it's not a conspiracy. Ted texted me. What's your plan? [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1230.96s)]
*  Yeah. Ball in tomorrow, brother. We were supposed to play basketball tomorrow morning. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1237.44s)]
*  Where? At a park. Why do you do this? I mean, it's just, I played this morning. I don't think [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1246.8s)]
*  I don't think the air quality is terrible. I know. I actually, I did. I didn't realize that it was [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1256.8799999999999s)]
*  like that. I played basketball this morning and I like, it tastes like metal in my mouth. It is [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1264.32s)]
*  across Los Angeles for air quality. You're not supposed to go outside. Okay. I'm not very smart. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1270.1599999999999s)]
*  Like everybody, everybody knows I say it all the time. People don't listen to me when I say it. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1276.32s)]
*  Yeah, I'm kidding. I'm not going to actually play basketball with Ted. Are you kidding? Yeah, I'm [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1281.12s)]
*  kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm not. I would like to. It depends on the wind conditions and [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1284.88s)]
*  where the fire is. If imagine if the wind moves the smoke away from where I'm playing basketball, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1292.16s)]
*  like what are you going to do? Not it is going to be so smoky. It's all coming this way. Yeah. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1298.96s)]
*  Women always shitting on your phone. True. Okay. I am kidding. But like, I, but like, I'll, you know, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1306.24s)]
*  it's more so like, like we're in a holding pattern. We're in a wait and see type situation [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1312.48s)]
*  and evacuation center for a sunset fire has been open at the pan Pacific recreational center [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1318.08s)]
*  opened at okay. Pan Pacific recreational center is now an evacuation center. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1322.48s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, the, uh, times where he's like, I'm going to get, I'm going to get arrested [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1330.16s)]
*  real quick so I can go fight these fires. Oh, is he talking about? I didn't see that. Yeah. He said [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1336.24s)]
*  I'm going to go get arrested incarcerated. So then I can go fight these fires. Here's a list of [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1343.76s)]
*  resources for shelter, animal boarding, free items and distribution hubs. These places can also use [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1350.72s)]
*  donations, easy food, water, mass and blankets. That's crazy. All right. Well, you must ball [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1354.32s)]
*  tomorrow. What would LeBron do? LeBron would ball LAFD says all fires and so killer is your [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1363.52s)]
*  percent containment private plane and get the fuck out of here. He would never do that. He would, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1368.08s)]
*  he would save Los Angeles just like he saved basketball, just like he saved the sport of [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1373.12s)]
*  basketball. He would also save the city of Los Angeles. Um, all right. I'm going to go, um, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1377.84s)]

*  Oh yeah. I'm going to keep doing that. That's what that's my five head plan. My mother, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1423.12s)]
*  again, so you're okay. I will let you know if your house is on fire. I promise. Sunset fire yet [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1427.84s)]
*  again. And it looks like, it looks like some embers. This is from 25 minutes ago for one [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1434.72s)]
*  residence. It could be an apartment. Let's go over to Gil labels. He's overhead in sky five. Gil. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1442.16s)]
*  Yeah, Mike and share. We're trying to get an angle on this. It's a, it looks like a fire on a balcony. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1449.28s)]
*  Possibly some of the embers got into a balcony. It looks like, or maybe it's a rough line. It's [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1453.92s)]
*  hard to tell. Actually it looks like a, yeah, balcony there that's caught on fire. This is [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1458.5600000000002s)]
*  off of Franklin and Vista and that fire just kicking off just moments ago. We came around in [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1464.4s)]
*  an orbit and spotted it. And so that's the first structure that is caught fire here that we know of [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1469.36s)]
*  and we're waiting to hear from the fire department. If they are aware of it or not, [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1475.36s)]
*  we just started kicking off when we came around on that orbit. So that's a big concern for fire. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1479.76s)]
*  Yeah, this is a good news. The sunset fire is slowing down. Looks like it won't spread much more. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1484.64s)]
*  There you go. See no need to worry. No need to worry. We're all good. We're all good. You see that? [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1503.2800000000002s)]
*  I just don't understand why people don't just surround their homes with water to stop the [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1512.88s)]
*  fires. Like a moat, right? That's what I'm talking about. Yeah. See fire already on its way out. It's [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1515.8400000000001s)]
*  so last year, dude. Fire is like, fire is a construct. When you think about it and, and yeah. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1526.24s)]

*  And it is so good to see those water dropping helicopters and for those, for the water to make [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=1541.2s)]

*  Why? [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=2920.48s)]
*  Noticing is the stark contrast between a building like this one and say the farmica right next door. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=2923.68s)]
*  It's amazing. It's completely unscathed. And then we're on the other side of the street where [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=2930.48s)]
*  there's a Chipotle, a bokeh and ice cream shop. I'm losing my mind. My mom is inviting random [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=2934.96s)]
*  people to my house right now. She saw some people. I have to go to the camera outside of your place. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=2940.64s)]
*  And she asked them on the intercom if they want to come in flames. And that's what a lot of the [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=2944.88s)]
*  neighborhoods around here look like too. You have one or two homes that are completely fine. And [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=2949.6s)]
*  then two, three or four homes that are decimated. And people are understandably curious and concerned. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=2955.36s)]
*  They've been coming back to their homes today. Who's the real socialist here? [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=2962.96s)]
*  A lot of young people have been devastated to learn that their family home is no longer. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=2966.88s)]
*  That's been a tough pill to swallow. You see a couple of the police cars coming down this way. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=2972.32s)]
*  It seems as though, you know, they're just heading to these hot spots from one spot to another and [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=2978.7200000000003s)]
*  doing their best to prioritize areas where they can fortify structures, where they can do structure [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=2984.64s)]
*  protection. Oh my god, there's still fire going inside there. Obviously a building like this one, [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=2990.4s)]
*  this Chase building, is a total loss at this point. This is not something that they can save, [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=2994.7200000000003s)]
*  but there are other areas and other homes that they are able to save. We caught up with an army [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=3000.1600000000003s)]
*  reservist who was just driving by. He stopped to talk to us. He's from Long Beach. He was in the [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=3005.28s)]
*  army for many years and he's heading up to Topanga Canyon right now just to help, just to offer his [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=3010.4s)]
*  services. He says, you know, he was in the army and his duty is to protect and serve and that's [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=3015.68s)]
*  exactly what he's doing tonight. Listen to what he told us. So I think Jimmy Carter said it best. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=3022.24s)]
*  Will wants to get a freezer pizza. Yeah. And bust it open. I'm eating my feelings. You know I do that. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=3028.0s)]
*  Besides the policy for two, you know, it's by the safest side. I do. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=3035.68s)]
*  We build a pillow fort in your living room. Not flammably right. Because it's flame retardant. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=3040.4s)]
*  Yeah. And we can say that word only in this context. Maybe if we set up your second PC in there [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=3047.44s)]
*  and we play League of Legends from the pillow fort. So that way we have access to information [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=3056.1600000000003s)]
*  out here. It's nearly empty. I like what you're saying. Yeah. Except there are still some lights on. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=3064.1600000000003s)]
*  I do still maintain the position that League of Legends is responsible for the Bedlam. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=3069.1200000000003s)]
*  Well it's going to put us in a strategic mindset in case people are eating, people shopping, [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=3074.2400000000002s)]
*  or Marvel rivals. But obviously it's now within the evacuation zone. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=3080.32s)]
*  I don't want to be in a shitty mood while we're evacuating. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=3084.88s)]
*  LA's already getting cooked. I don't have to watch you. Oh come on. Come on. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=3088.08s)]
*  The words from our young man. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We laughed. We'll be required [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=3092.8s)]
*  here in Southern California to turn this corner and see the sunlight again from all of us. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=3098.64s)]
*  Yeah. To do this together. Yeah. You know. Yeah. That is insane. It's affected so many people that [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=3105.68s)]
*  we know personally and you know it's frightening to truly to be telling these people's stories [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=3112.64s)]
*  but also to be part of it you know and you know you just hope for. Look how gridlocked [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=3121.76s)]
*  the streets are. I know how gridlocked the streets are. I was in them. That will be required. We had [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=3127.2000000000003s)]
*  to ditch our car basically. We had to park in an auxiliary spot. I for one have no doubt. No one is [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=3131.44s)]
*  a red parallel line. I'm definitely going to get ticketed as Rachel continues to track developments. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=3136.2400000000002s)]
*  That would be insane. In the Palisades. Marybeth McDade who was in the Palisades last night. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feAXto4LuLA&t=3142.7200000000003s)]
