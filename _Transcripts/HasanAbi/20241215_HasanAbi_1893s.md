# Dan Bilzerian And Bradley Martyn Debate About The H*l*caust | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [December 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w)
*  Do you think that, do you think that none of it happened? I think that they were not [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=0.0s)]
*  camps. And when you, and the red cross went in there and they, you know, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=4.48s)]
*  they he's literally pointing to like very famous instances of, of propaganda. Like this is [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=8.48s)]
*  something that the red cross, it was originally the Nazi red cross that went in and were like, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=17.92s)]
*  Oh, these are just like regular camps. Like these are interment camps. We need to [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=23.2s)]
*  But yeah, where is that though? The one Dan bulls area and snippet that went viral on Twitter. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=30.48s)]
*  I just want to look at that one specifically because he brings up the and starts questioning [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=37.68s)]
*  the hall numbers or whatever. And that's like, that's it. That's the maximalist position. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  You're you're like, I think he, he starts off talking about like, you know, the, the reason why [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=48.0s)]
*  Dan was there is nefarious is because like one, he already has a lot of like right-wing fans in [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=56.0s)]
*  general from being Dan bulls area and you know, kind of an asshole, but like this rich guy, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=61.68s)]
*  right poker hero, whatever. And he's already a dickhead. But then recently he popped off [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=67.76s)]
*  because every now and again, he would make these statements about Israel and Palestine, right? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=74.88s)]
*  And the statements, if they were, if his statements were kept to like a 30 second snippet, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=81.6s)]
*  sometimes it made sense because you can be an anti-Semite and still be capable of making a [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=88.08s)]
*  valid critique about Israel's actions. But the next 30 seconds usually was the most important part [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=94.88s)]
*  because he would immediately talk about, immediately talk about why he was, why he [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=101.28s)]
*  believed Israel was doing this. And he would turn it back to Judaism and not only the Torah, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=107.28s)]
*  but the Talmud. This is a ancient Talmudic understanding of, of what, how the Jews are. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=111.44s)]
*  Okay. It is akin to saying every Christian is like the Westboro Baptist church. It is akin to [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=120.4s)]
*  saying every Muslim is ISIS. When you point to, and sometimes Nazis love doing this, when you [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=125.68s)]
*  point to like random, you know, cojones or whatever and be like, this is what every Jew thinks. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=132.16s)]
*  This is how every Jew operates. It's just pure anti-Semitism. Okay. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=141.76s)]
*  Why are they so protected? And it's like, okay, you know, that's what everybody points to. That's [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=148.32s)]
*  why they're so protected. And then you start looking at the numbers, the bullshit, it gets [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=153.6s)]
*  and they revise the figures. It's not like some crazy good- [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=159.12s)]
*  This is one of the craziest things that people do because it's like the most studied atrocity, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=162.23999999999998s)]
*  like straight up. Like it's not, it's not a secret, man. I mean, you're relying on people's lack of [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=169.92s)]
*  knowledge and inherent distrust of, of institutions to make this argument, to say that like this [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=175.28s)]
*  insanely well-documented atrocity at this point in 2024 is actually real suspicious, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=184.39999999999998s)]
*  real sneaky. I don't really understand what's going on. It's like, there's plenty you don't [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=194.16s)]
*  understand. Okay. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=199.67999999999998s)]
*  It's like, conspiracy. They said 4 million people died in Auschwitz and then they literally revised [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=201.12s)]
*  it and said it was more like 1.1 to 1.5 million. Well, it's like, how can you be that far off? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=205.35999999999999s)]
*  That's like less than half of what you said as a quarter of what you said, or, you know, or like [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=210.88s)]
*  a third of- I think he's just talking about Auschwitz, but no, I think the final number [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=215.28s)]
*  is 6 million Jews specifically. It's much larger than that overall. But if you're talking about [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=219.68s)]
*  how many Jews were slaughtered in the Holocaust is 6 million, not four. And what's really, sorry. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=225.12s)]
*  What's really interesting about this is that Dan Bilzerian is saying this and he's a pretty [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=234.8s)]
*  prominent Armenian man. So as a prominent Armenian American, I think he probably knows very well [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  when people deny genocides, you know, that's what makes it crazy to me is that what he's doing right [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=246.08s)]
*  now for the Holocaust is exactly what you learn in school in Turkey about the Armenian genocide, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=255.04s)]
*  that it's like not real. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=260.88s)]
*  Or what you said. And then you start looking at like, just the math on this stuff, like the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=262.08s)]
*  math doesn't math. Like you cannot cremate that many bodies. You'd be creaming those [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=268.64s)]
*  those bodies for hundreds of years, not to mention like gas chambers are not like an effective, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=273.44s)]
*  efficient way to kill people. And these are the, these are the Germans. These are the guys. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=278.8s)]
*  He didn't deny it. What do you mean? Yes, dude. It's called Holocaust revisionism. It's a, it's a, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=282.0s)]
*  it's a subtle denial. It's a way to, it's a way to brush the subject matter with plausible [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=287.44s)]
*  deniability. Are we really doing this? This is like literally combating antisemitism 101, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=292.64s)]
*  like, hello? Yeah. It's, it's not even subtle for the record. I don't think it's subtle, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=298.08s)]
*  but maybe for people who, maybe for people who are just like completely, he said is over [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  exaggerated. Yes. It's called Holocaust revisionism. There's an entire field of study [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=308.72s)]
*  dedicated to this as well. Yeah. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=314.56s)]
*  It has the best tanks, the best fighter jets, the best technology of anybody in the world. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=316.4s)]
*  And they're going to put a wooden door on a gas chamber. They're going to like, I mean, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=323.2s)]
*  just think about the logistics of it. If you just want to, you know, whatever, say five, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=326.08s)]
*  6 million people, you're not going to march a hundred of them into a shower at a time, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=330.15999999999997s)]
*  gas them, wait for the gas release, then put all those people in wheelbarrows, wheel them out, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=334.71999999999997s)]
*  dig, like think about the time it would take. Like, so do you think that, do you think that [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=339.52s)]
*  none of it happened? I think that they were not camps. And when you, and the red cross went in [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=344.4s)]
*  there and they, you know, he's literally pointing to like very famous instances of, of propaganda. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=349.76s)]
*  Like this is something that the red cross, it was originally the Nazi red cross that went in [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=359.76s)]
*  and were like, Oh, these are just like regular camps. Like these are interment camps. We need to, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=365.2s)]
*  we need to keep them. We need to keep some of these people locked away. These are criminals. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=369.52s)]
*  Then the international red cross went in to a, yeah, the Reisenstadt ghetto and the red cross [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=375.59999999999997s)]
*  is something that we talked about yesterday. Ironically enough, it was considered a model [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=383.91999999999996s)]
*  ghetto for deceiving the international committee of red cross representatives about the ongoing [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=387.59999999999997s)]
*  hoes and the Nazi plan to murder all Jews, but not to fight German red cross visited a ghetto [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=392.15999999999997s)]
*  in 1943 and filed the only accurate report on the ghetto describing overcrowding and undernourishment. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=396.4s)]
*  Okay. In 1944, the ghetto was beautified in preparation for a delegation from the [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=403.52s)]
*  international committee of red cross and the Danish government. The delegation visited on the 23rd [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=407.28000000000003s)]
*  of June ICRC delegate Maurice Roselle wrote a favorable report on the ghetto and claimed that [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=412.0s)]
*  no one was deported from the Reisenstadt on April, 1945. Another ICRC delegation was allowed to visit [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=416.8s)]
*  the ghetto despite the contemporaries liberation of other concentration camps and continue to [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=422.48s)]
*  repeat Ross's erroneous findings. The SS turned over the ghetto to the ICRC on the second of May, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=426.64s)]
*  several days before the end of the war. Not only did these guys, not only did these guys actually [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=433.03999999999996s)]
*  actively document the overwhelming majority of the people that they, that they slaughtered, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=438.71999999999997s)]
*  why the should they have even documented it? They don't give a shit. They're just mass killing. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=446.08s)]
*  Do you understand? It's the same as looking at it's no different than looking at the accurate [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=450.8s)]
*  assessment from the Palestinian health ministry of all of the people that have been meticulously, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=457.36s)]
*  meticulously logged as killed by Israeli rockets or Israeli gunfire specifically. That's where that [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=464.48s)]
*  like 40 to 50,000 number comes from. There are hundreds of thousands totaling in deaths that [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=470.8s)]
*  have been caused by the ongoing siege and yet this is all meticulously calculated. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=478.8s)]
*  Okay, you have to understand Israel denies that shit where they go, nah, they're all terrorists [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=485.68s)]
*  or those numbers are wrong. They do the same exact atrocity denial and propaganda that many do. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=490.40000000000003s)]
*  Mike Dambelzarian is doing right here against the Holocaust. And you have to remember they're mass [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=496.88s)]
*  slaughtering all Jews. It is wild that they took this many meticulous, this, this many [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=504.4s)]
*  meticulous data points to begin with. Like it's already unique that they were already calculating [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=511.59999999999997s)]
*  like and had direct names and identification papers for like millions of Jews that they had killed. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=518.3199999999999s)]
*  Okay. They did their assessment. They said 280,000 Jews or 271,000 Jews died in Auschwitz. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=526.0799999999999s)]
*  And it was mostly from typhus and mostly from malnutrition. And you look at like, you know, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=532.08s)]
*  the only gas they had in the walls, which that gas stays in the walls forever was Zygon being [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=536.1600000000001s)]
*  Zygon be as a typhus. That's not like what you used to. And so you start looking at this stuff [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=540.8000000000001s)]
*  and you're like, yeah, obviously Jews died in world war II, but like you come out of war where [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=546.88s)]
*  like 80 million people died. And you're also talking about like, you know, the, the comm yeah, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=550.5600000000001s)]
*  count Bernadette of the Swedish Red Cross fell so much shame and not pushing magazine, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=556.24s)]
*  the Nazi propaganda that he went to Palestine during the knockout, the request of the Jews. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=559.2s)]
*  However, he refused to spread pro-Israel propaganda and reported honestly on the, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=562.48s)]
*  what he saw the Stern gang assassinated him for it. I didn't know that he, I didn't know that that [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=566.48s)]
*  happened. Is this Holocaust denial? Is this what I came into today? Yes. This is straightforward, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=570.96s)]
*  very aggressive Holocaust denial. And the problem with this kind of shit is that a guy like Bradley [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=576.96s)]
*  Martin or even many of you are probably going to not be equipped enough equipped enough to like [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=584.8s)]
*  debate these points. That's the problem with Nazis. That's the problem with anti-Semites in [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=590.4s)]
*  general. You have to be like, you have to be a historian of the Holocaust because it's so easy [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=595.52s)]
*  to just lie. And it's so difficult to reconstruct the truth when someone is just straight up lying. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=601.68s)]
*  This is part of the problem with platforming people who enter the conversation, enter the fray, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=608.3199999999999s)]
*  with a, with a bunch of different, with a bunch of different cultural touch points, like, oh, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=615.52s)]
*  Dave Olsery. And he's like this crazy guy. He's a poker guy, whatever. And then all of a sudden, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=621.3599999999999s)]
*  boom, it's like straightforward, unfettered, unrestricted, Holocaust denial. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=625.4399999999999s)]
*  And that's what we sided with, you know, prior to that, that was the bulls**t [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=632.24s)]
*  evolution. And they killed like 30 million Christians just during that alone. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=635.68s)]
*  That also is another sussy ass f**king tag. They killed 30 million Christians. Whenever I hear about [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=640.08s)]
*  like the Armenian genocide being presented from the perspective of like, oh, it's the Ottoman Turks [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=646.32s)]
*  that killed the Armenians because they're Christian. Okay. And then they turn around and say like, oh, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=652.1600000000001s)]
*  they killed the Russians because they're Christian. Yeah. You're like a f**king Christian nationalist [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=656.5600000000001s)]
*  type of Nazi. Okay. It's a very specific type of Nazi. Like, no, these were, these atrocities were [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=660.5600000000001s)]
*  not conducted against Christianity. Okay. Ridiculous. And those are the people we sided with, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=667.12s)]
*  like, and that was 84% Jewish. So, you know, the Bolshevik revolution is 84%. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=672.8s)]
*  Can I be honest? I'm happy you're speaking on this, but lately it feels very much like you [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=678.08s)]
*  continue to defend your anti-Semitism instead of focusing on defend my anti-Semitism instead [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=680.96s)]
*  of focusing on the Palestine and genocide, as well as promoting organizing for your followers. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=685.76s)]
*  I think it's very clear you're not anti-Semitic and I don't feel like you have to keep defending [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=689.52s)]

*  Jewish and they mass murdered Christians. Nobody talks about that. Why don't they talk about that [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=703.92s)]
*  genocide? They only talk about 6 million Jews, 6 million Jews, 6 million Jews, 6 million Jews. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=707.52s)]
*  And that 6 million figure was used like 256 times in newspapers, you know, New York Times, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=712.16s)]
*  all these reputable newspapers before World War II even started. It was 6 million Jews, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=718.0s)]
*  6 million Jews. Wait, what? That's what? No, that's not the f**k. If anything, if you want [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=721.68s)]
*  to talk about the f**king incompetence of mainstream press, especially in the West, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=730.64s)]
*  they said the exact opposite. They were like, come on, Hitler's just Josh in about the anti-Semitism [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=735.92s)]
*  stuff. They literally glazed Hitler, dude. What are you talking about? You f**king idiot. They [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=742.3199999999999s)]

*  that s**t. He's just trying to win over the German vogue. What the f**k? 2025 is the year of prove [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=753.6s)]
*  your lie where when someone is accused of lying and tries to defend by demanding proof, the counter [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=759.92s)]
*  argument is that they have to prove their lie to support it. Yeah. Most people ironic that he's [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=763.36s)]
*  complaining about talking about Jewish casualties and completely discards the Roma Sinti people. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=767.12s)]
*  Yeah. Or any number of different victims of the Holocaust that spanned. The total number is like [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=771.12s)]
*  12 million or 14 million. Six million is the number of Jewish people that were killed. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=782.5600000000001s)]
*  Were the Holocaust and irons when it was happening? What was happening today in Gaza? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=788.16s)]
*  Or was it widely accepted that it was happening? Dude, there was no internet. What are you talking [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=791.6s)]
*  about? You think the average person in the Western world knew that there was like [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=795.6s)]
*  straight up constitution camps like filled slam with like Jews? Well, no, they just didn't. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=800.96s)]
*  Most people didn't f**king know what the hell was going on. Most people didn't know what the hell [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=805.76s)]
*  was going on in general, not just the Holocaust, but just in general. Like the media was infinitely [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=809.2s)]
*  more centralized and more controlled than it is now. It was only after the liberation of the camps [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=814.32s)]
*  where the Western world knew the, and not even the full scope of the atrocities, but like [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=822.0s)]
*  started developing a better understanding of some of the atrocities. It took years and years [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=827.6s)]
*  of calculation, years and years of meticulously swifting, you know, searching through the data [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=836.16s)]
*  to get a full assessment and full autopsy of the atrocities that took place. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=844.56s)]
*  The only difference is you can say that like the average German person knew and just like [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=850.48s)]
*  looked the other way. Didn't care about it. I am, you know, I understand that argument, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=858.4s)]
*  but as far as like random Americans in like Missouri, I don't think they f**king, there's [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=865.04s)]
*  tons of reports on the red army about how they were all baffled with the inhumanity. Even after [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=869.6s)]
*  them just being invaded by the Germans. Yeah. Like there are reports of generals and other people [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=873.28s)]
*  that like reported on the conditions of these camps and like what was going on. And people were [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=879.52s)]
*  like, that's insane. You're exaggerating. We have a war to win, you know, that type of s**t. Yeah. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=884.88s)]
*  A lot of people that even heard about it were like, come on. And I think that is, I think that is [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=890.0s)]
*  partially because, you know, it's one, the atrocities were so insane and two, there's not, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=896.24s)]
*  you don't have like the level of information dissemination that you do now with like the [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=905.5200000000001s)]
*  internet. And make no mistake, there are people who know exactly what the f**k is going on in Gaza. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=911.2800000000001s)]
*  You can have, you have direct access nowadays to a person that is existing under a genocidal [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=917.84s)]
*  occupation. A person that can escape this genocide. I've had a genocide survivor on this stream. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=926.08s)]
*  Motaz Aziza, not only is a genocide survivor, but he straight up, he filmed it like he filmed it. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=933.84s)]
*  He was responsible for showing to the rest of the world. And, and yet people still don't give a s**t [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=940.24s)]
*  or those who give a s**t can only fight for so long. And it seems like regardless of the fact [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=945.36s)]
*  that people do give a s**t, regardless of the fact that people do care and people do protest [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=952.48s)]
*  against it, our governments don't care. The appetite that our governments historically have [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=956.4000000000001s)]
*  had for death and destruction is much higher than the average person. Like, and then you look at [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=962.48s)]
*  the census Bureau and there's more Jews two years after World War II than there was before. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=967.04s)]
*  Once again, this right here is also exactly what people who defend Israel say. Yeah. Oh, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=973.6800000000001s)]
*  wow. I can't believe there was more Jewish people in America. Wow. That's crazy that the [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=981.6800000000001s)]
*  Nazis were not able to come to the United States of America and steal our Jews. How shocking. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=988.16s)]
*  How shocking to me that there that Jewish people kept, you know, having children throughout the [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=996.08s)]
*  process. That's crazy, man. For the record, this is exactly what people f**king say about both the [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1001.76s)]
*  Nakba and when they're engaging in like genocide denial of the Palestinians, they're like, there's [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1008.88s)]
*  more Palestinians now than there ever were before. I guess it's not a genocide. So it's, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1013.76s)]
*  that's why I always say it's like, it's a handshake between anti-Semites on both sides. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1019.84s)]
*  You got pro-Israel anti-Semites and you got anti-Israel anti-Semites. They're both fascist. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1025.6s)]
*  They're just fascist for different groups. One is an anti-Jewish fascist. Jews are the out group [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1031.92s)]
*  and their ideology, Dambel's Aryan. And for others, they are anti-Arab, anti-Palestinian, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1037.76s)]
*  anti-Muslim fascists, usually Islamophobic fascists. So Jews are the in group in that [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1043.6s)]
*  situation. And the out group are, you know, Muslims and maybe anyone and everyone that is against [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1048.8799999999999s)]
*  the nation state of Israel. So like the numbers don't make any sense. And also, look, I'm Armenian. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1054.72s)]
*  They killed half my people and Israel denies that genocide. But yet if you even question their [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1066.08s)]
*  genocide, wait, interesting, interesting, interesting enough. All every, all manner of [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1071.6799999999998s)]
*  the genocide denial that he engaged in the Turkish government engages in as well. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1080.8s)]
*  What's really interesting about this also is that, yeah, I wonder why Israel would deny the [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1085.6s)]
*  Armenian genocide. Perhaps the reason why they would deny the Armenian genocide is because one, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1091.9199999999998s)]
*  Turkey is a trade partner, a very valuable, very important trade partner. He's lying. No, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1098.32s)]
*  Israel for the longest time did not recognize the Armenian genocide. Okay. This is 100%. This is 100% [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1103.4399999999998s)]
*  a fact. And I don't think that they still like, they're still partial about it. Okay. And neither [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1111.04s)]
*  did the United States of America until recently. The reason why they don't, the reason why they [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1117.1999999999998s)]
*  didn't is because the Armenian genocide is quite similar in many ways to what Israel is conducting. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1121.76s)]
*  Yeah, this is just a committee, not an official state pronouncement. Yeah, it makes sense. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1129.6s)]
*  Azerbaijan and Turkey are big partners to Israel. I think there are two cities in Israel that [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1133.9199999999998s)]
*  recognize it. Anyway, why has Israel not yet recognized the Armenian genocide religious affairs [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1138.2399999999998s)]
*  of Israel's diplomatic, military and economic concerns? Trump is moral imperative [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1143.52s)]
*  from the Jerusalem post. So yeah, interestingly enough, this man has no, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1147.76s)]
*  this man has no issue denying the Holocaust. Okay. Questioning the numbers, claiming that it was like, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1155.04s)]
*  you know, 60,000 people only fucking ridiculous while simultaneously he's like, well, you know, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1162.96s)]
*  Israel denies the Armenian genocide. It's like, okay, investigate that a little bit further. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1169.92s)]
*  You know, you are descended of genocide survivors of the Armenian genocide. Investigate that a [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1175.92s)]
*  little bit further, maybe examine that. Wonder why I quote unquote in Germany, you'll go to jail. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1183.28s)]
*  There was a woman that just died in jail recently because she, you know, she was around during [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1191.28s)]
*  World War II. Yeah. Yeah. She was a Holocaust denier and she was alive during the Holocaust. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1197.12s)]
*  Yeah. She was a fucking Nazi, dude. What do you mean? Yeah. Hello. Even the other Nazis knew not [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1204.96s)]
*  to openly be like, yeah, the Holocaust is fake. So they could go and become fucking NATO generals. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1212.6399999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? That's crazy. I can't believe it. This Nazi witnessed the Holocaust [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1218.1599999999999s)]
*  and denied it till the day she died. She could have just done what the rest of the leadership [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1223.28s)]
*  in Western Germany did, which was, okay, we won't like openly deny the Holocaust and openly deny the [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1227.92s)]
*  genocide. And then we can still run the country and even, you know, become, become active participants [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1234.0s)]
*  in America's imperialism by joining the ranks of NATO. She saw what happened. She said, you know, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1241.36s)]
*  they didn't mass murder these Jews. Like I saw it. This didn't happen. They locked her in jail. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1249.52s)]
*  And they said, you can get out of jail if you just acknowledge that this happened. And she refused to [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1254.4s)]
*  do it. She literally died in jail. This is like a 90 year old woman or whatever. And, you know, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1258.24s)]
*  you look at like the people that acknowledge this and they were like, you know, they got confessions [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1263.28s)]
*  from these people via torture. They were like crushing their nuts. They're doing all these [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1267.52s)]
*  torture things. And that those are the people that confessed to this crime. So in this started [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1270.8799999999999s)]
*  becoming more apparent with what's going on in Israel. Like they said, people were, you know, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1276.16s)]
*  made into lampshades and, and, and, and soap and they acknowledge that that was all lies. And then [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1280.24s)]
*  you look at what Israel said for October 7th, beheaded babies, babies in ovens. They come up [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1286.4s)]
*  with all this stuff that sounds really horrific. And it was all mass-raised. Why is Bradley not [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1292.16s)]
*  pushing back at all? Because the average person has no understanding. Even an educated person [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1297.3600000000001s)]
*  is going to have a fucking hard time. That's why it's better to not talk to these motherfuckers at [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1303.68s)]
*  all. Do you not understand? Everybody, everybody thinks that they would if they were to talk to an [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1307.6000000000001s)]
*  out and about straightforward anti-semite like this, they would pop off. Bradley is hard-specced [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1313.92s)]
*  in the weightlifting. He doesn't know shit about this. Exactly. He has no capacity to fucking deal [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1320.0800000000002s)]
*  with this shit, which is why I always say it's, it's like flat earthers, man, which is more, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1324.5600000000002s)]
*  which is, you know, innocuous. It's not as like significant or severe as like straightforward [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1329.44s)]
*  denial of the Holocaust, which is like the maximalist anti-semitic position. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1335.52s)]
*  But like flat earthers have their own set of rules. They have their own set of standards. They have [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1339.76s)]
*  their own set of facts. You have to literally vigorously interrogate all of that, figure it out, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1343.2s)]
*  learn it, know what the counters are to be able to have a normal conversation with a fucking flat [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1349.6000000000001s)]
*  earther. Okay. That's it. That's the problem. I'm using a, like a more, I'm using like a silly [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1353.9199999999998s)]
*  example. So you understand like even a silly thing, even a silly conspiracy, if they have, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1360.32s)]
*  even if it's a silly ass fucking conspiracy, there is an entire world that they've crafted, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1365.84s)]
*  an entire world of lies that they've crafted. Okay. So it's very difficult to parse through all [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1371.04s)]
*  of that and just, and actively push back against this because as I've always said, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1376.72s)]
*  it's relatively easy to just straight up lie, especially if you're confident. Okay. Very easy [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1383.2s)]
*  to lie. Very hard to dispel these lies. That's it. All the stuff is all and then you, and so you [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1389.84s)]
*  start seeing, it's like these people have such a pattern of lying. And then you look at the media, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1398.48s)]
*  the media's lied to us like during COVID, like how many times we get lied to. Yeah. And then he [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1402.48s)]
*  ties it to like something that Bradley also was like suspicious about and boom, the circle is [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1407.6s)]
*  complete. Oh, well, you know, well, well, the media lies about COVID and then you're like, oh yeah, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1413.52s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know if I trust COVID was the thing that originally made me be like, I don't [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1420.8s)]
*  know if I believe anything that the government's ever said about. Yeah, there you go. And the [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1424.88s)]
*  circle is complete is packaged clipped and fucking shipped bro. Got his hair cut in a GTA barber [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1430.08s)]
*  shop. I feel like Nazis and flat earthers are the easiest people to debate. My brother turned to a [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1438.0s)]
*  tanky anti-vax insult. That is stressful. Wait, what a tanky. What are you saying? If people are [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1441.76s)]
*  confused, go explain to a person obsessed with the drones that they're showing you a video of an [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1447.76s)]
*  airplane. Yeah. Every one of these theories is a set of facts. That sounds really convincing. If [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1451.04s)]
*  you don't understand it, if there was a flat earther speaking unchecked to your chat, at least [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1454.72s)]
*  someone fall for it. 100%. This is why it's better to just not offer any fucking any fucking [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1459.28s)]
*  platform to people like this straight up. I know people will say like, Oh, well, you know, you're [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1466.0s)]
*  censorious, but it's like the ultimate goal, the ultimate goal of an anti-Semite, the ultimate goal [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1471.36s)]
*  of a Nazi is not actually to have a reasonable conversation and have their opinions be challenged. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1476.8s)]
*  Their ultimate goal is to just sneak as many fucking anti-Semitic takes in there as possible [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1484.72s)]
*  with the hopes that they can get some members of your community or some people who are listening [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1490.24s)]
*  to be on board, to be cynical, to, to get on board with the things that they're advocating for. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1495.52s)]
*  What's the statement? It's like they enjoy the lie. Okay. They enjoy it. They enjoy the, the act of [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1502.08s)]
*  lying because maybe some of them know that they're lying and it doesn't fucking matter. Okay. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1508.88s)]
*  Motherfucker Fauci lied continuously on national TV and all the legacy news outlets that the [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1520.48s)]
*  exact same thing is possible to not trust the government while not believing it's a [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1524.24s)]
*  depopulation plot. What are you talking about? Like what did did Antonio Fauci deliberately lie [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1528.16s)]
*  to the American public or did epidemiologists of all different backgrounds universally [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1535.6s)]
*  tasked with like combating a novel pandemic, a novel virus that was ripping through every fucking [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1543.04s)]
*  developed country and also undeveloped nations as well. They were tasked with defending the public [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1551.1999999999998s)]
*  and they were trying to do their very best. I personally think most people in positions of [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1559.36s)]
*  power like that have this, this delicate balance that they have to take. They can't, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1564.16s)]
*  they can't just say, you know, this is the, this is not that big of a deal because then people [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1570.96s)]
*  won't take it seriously and then more people will die as they did in the United States of America. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1576.3200000000002s)]
*  Okay. And the only times were like Antonio Fauci has seen, take me down. I can't take the heat. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1581.2s)]
*  Okay. That's why you saw so many, what's crazy is so many of the things these, these conspiracy [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1586.48s)]
*  are so broad, so fucking widespread that you had people literally dying with a ventilator, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1592.8s)]
*  shoved down their fucking throats who in their dying breath still thought COVID was fake and [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1599.04s)]
*  it's just killing them. It sucks. But people basically were just of one mind where they're [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1603.12s)]
*  like, no, this is an invisible thing. I don't believe it. I don't care. I will not take the [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1609.12s)]
*  necessary precautions. And no matter what happens, it happens. Okay. Anyway, here, this is when the [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1615.6s)]
*  camps are being liberated by the, the, the Soviet army. When I entered the barrack, I saw living [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1623.1999999999998s)]
*  skeletons lying on three tiered bunks as in fog. I hear my soldiers saying, you are free comrades. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1629.28s)]
*  I sense that they do not understand us and begin speaking to them in Russian, Polish, German, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1635.36s)]
*  Ukrainian dialects. I'm buttoning my leather jacket. I show them my metals. Then I use Yiddish. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1639.36s)]
*  Their reaction is unpredictable. They think I am provoking them. They begin to hide. And only when [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1644.64s)]
*  I say to them, do not be afraid. I am a Colonel of the Soviet army and a Jew. We have come to [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1650.5600000000002s)]
*  liberate you. Finally, as if the barrier collapsed, they rushed towards us, shouting fell on their [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1656.0s)]
*  knees, kiss the flaps of our overcoats and threw their arms around our legs. And we could not move [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1661.76s)]
*  stood motionless while unexpected tears round down ran down our cheeks. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1668.6399999999999s)]
*  To the extent that we can access the red army's views. It is through memoirs and letters. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1673.84s)]
*  Vasily Gromovsky, an officer of the sixtieth army offered this description. I realized that they were [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1677.44s)]
*  prisoners and not workers. So I called out, you are free. Come out. They began rushing towards us [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1682.48s)]
*  in a big crowd. They were weeping, embracing us, kissing us. I felt the grievance on behalf of [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1686.96s)]
*  mankind that these fascists had made such a mockery of us. It roused me and all the soldiers to go and [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1690.6399999999999s)]
*  quickly destroy them and send them to hell. Fake letters. Yeah, you're right, man. Yeah, you're [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1696.32s)]
*  right. Millions of people encountered this, like millions, tens of millions of people have direct [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1701.2s)]
*  lineage that they can trace back to the camps. Like hundreds of millions of people were touched [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1707.6s)]
*  by this in some meaningful fashion. But it's all fake. You know, it's all fake. It's all made up. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1712.48s)]
*  It's the greatest makeup of all time. Like it's just like the dumbest argument of all time, man. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1718.32s)]
*  It's the dumbest fucking argument of all time. It's so stupid. Everything is a lie mentality. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1723.52s)]
*  It's so stupid. Yes, the government has lied in the past. They've also told the truth because [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1728.1599999999999s)]
*  the government is like a million different people in a race, conflicting and shifting interest. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1731.28s)]
*  Yeah. And one of the things that I always said during the pandemic, especially with the vaccine [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1734.6399999999999s)]
*  rollout, was always that like the American government is not interested in all of the [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1740.96s)]
*  Americans dying. Okay. They're interested in making sure that Americans, the ones that do work, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1746.56s)]
*  can continue going back to work. They don't want to cripple the, you don't want to cripple their [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1752.48s)]
*  economy. This is precisely the reason why much like cattle, they were very open to immediately [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1757.52s)]
*  supercharging vaccine rollout and getting everyone inoculated as fast as possible. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1765.1200000000001s)]
*  Okay. Because they wanted you to get back to work. Also all the wealthy people in positions of power [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1770.4s)]
*  literally skipped the line to get the vaccine before you. Why would they do that? Just because [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1775.52s)]
*  the government lies actively with regular frequency and the media always is there to, [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1779.76s)]
*  to offer validity to said lies. It doesn't mean that they're lying in every single individual [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1786.24s)]
*  instance. Okay. It's very frustrating. You didn't address this squid. So chatter point of [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1792.8s)]
*  depopulation. What do you mean? What was the point of depopulation? What boo, who law? What [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1799.44s)]
*  do you mean? What insane thing that I not mentioned Holocaust revisionism is why I didn't [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1804.96s)]
*  learn my extended family that didn't migrate was in the camps because Sephardi's weren't in the [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1809.68s)]
*  Holocaust. Just Euro Jews. Meanwhile, somewhere my father has stacks of books on the Holocaust. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1813.6000000000001s)]
*  The visions are so fucking deep. Oh chatters to the government wants to do depopulation, [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1817.1200000000001s)]
*  you know, of white people. Yeah, that's really stupid. Why the fuck would the government want [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1821.76s)]
*  to depopulate its own labor force, man? What are you talking about? And why would they especially [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1825.04s)]
*  want to depopulate the most servile, the ones that like actually do the ones that actually aren't [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1829.52s)]
*  cynical of these fake government narratives about how the vaccines are good for you? [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1834.8s)]
*  You know what I mean? It's so stupid. I mean, does the government lie about everything? They [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1840.3999999999999s)]
*  just tell the truth about communism. Yeah. Those people, those people love when the government [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1844.8799999999999s)]
*  tells the truth about socialism, you know, that's why all the free thinkers happen to agree with [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1850.1599999999999s)]
*  basically like the overwhelming majority of, of, of prevailing narratives that come from the media [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1857.76s)]
*  about the dangers of socialism. It's great. Yeah. There's selective skepticism. Yeah, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1864.24s)]
*  there's selective skeptics for sure. That's precisely the reason why they go. Bill Gates [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1869.84s)]
*  wants the microchip people to make them autistic and gay, but then they turn around and actually [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1876.16s)]
*  say they love Elon Musk. In spite of the fact that Elon Musk is literally the number one billionaire [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1880.48s)]
*  on the planet, the wealthiest one, the most powerful and is actively working to put a chip [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qbUGMIc7w&t=1886.24s)]
