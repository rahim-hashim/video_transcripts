# Bernie Sanders Criticizes Trump's Address To Congress | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ)
*  who work to protect our nuclear weapons, keep our planes from crashing and conduct the research [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=0.0s)]
*  that finds the cure for cancer. Only to rehire them two days later. I'm a Democrat and I love [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=5.12s)]
*  cutting government ways. Please. I love firing federal. Okay, so we've talked about economic [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=10.4s)]
*  security. I love firing federal workers. Just give me the job. I'm Alisa Slotkin. As someone who spent my [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=16.16s)]
*  life, I'm a Democrat. Let's get the Bernard Sanders. Say something that is grossly false. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=22.16s)]
*  Say it over and over again and have right wing social media blasted out endless times [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=31.6s)]
*  until people actually believe it. And then rather than address the real issues facing the American [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=40.0s)]
*  people, the struggles that the American people are facing, we find ourselves wasting endless [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=49.68s)]
*  amounts of time discussing Trump's absurdities. Let me just give you a very few examples. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=57.44s)]
*  Trump claimed that the 2020 election was stolen from him and that he won by a landslide. Remember [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=66.88s)]
*  that? A lie. Trump claimed that the January 6th insurrection was a day of love. A lie. Trump has [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=74.08s)]
*  claimed that millions of undocumented people voted and do vote in American elections. A lie. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=83.12s)]
*  Let this man sleep, man. Oh my God. I feel bad. Originating in China. A lie. Trump has claimed that [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=91.52s)]
*  Ukraine started the horrific war with Russia. A lie. And tonight, just tonight, Trump claimed that [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=98.4s)]
*  millions of dead people- A lie. Between the ages of 100 and 360, I guess, were collecting [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=106.72s)]
*  Social Security checks. And that is an outrageous lie intended to lay the groundwork for cuts to [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=113.28s)]
*  Social Security and dismantling the most successful and popular government program in history. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=120.88s)]
*  So let's be clear about that. Well over 99% of Social Security checks are going out to people [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=128.96s)]
*  who earned those checks. 70 million Americans. Nobody, nobody who was 150 years old or 200 years [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=136.48s)]
*  old or 300 years old is receiving Social Security checks. And on and on the lies go. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=147.44s)]
*  Now the purpose of all of this lying is not just to push his hateful right-wing ideology. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=157.52s)]
*  It is not just to try to divide us up. It is more than that. It is a masterful effort, and you saw [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=165.44s)]
*  that tonight, to deflect attention away from the most important issues facing the people of our [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=173.44s)]
*  country. Issues that Trump and his billionaire friends do not want to address because it is not [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=182.88s)]
*  in their financial interest. Trump gave his State of the Union speech tonight. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=191.76s)]
*  But if you listen closely, that speech had very little to say about the State of the Union, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=199.36s)]
*  about what is really going on in our country, especially for working families. Trump spoke [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=209.12s)]
*  for over 90 minutes, although I must confess it seemed a lot longer than that, and he almost [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=218.56s)]
*  completely ignored the issues that are keeping working people up at night as they worry about [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=224.24s)]
*  how their families are going to survive in these very tough times. And I will tell you exactly why [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=232.56s)]
*  Trump had very little to say about the real crises facing the working class of this country. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=240.32s)]
*  Think back six weeks ago when Trump was inaugurated for a second term as president, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=248.48s)]
*  six weeks ago. Standing right behind him were the three wealthiest men in this country, Mr. Musk, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=254.55999999999997s)]
*  Mr. Bezos, and Mr. Zuckerberg. And standing behind them were 13 other billionaires who Trump had [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=263.2s)]
*  nominated to head major government agencies. Many of these same billionaires, including Musk, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=271.68s)]
*  were in the Capitol tonight listening to that speech. In other words, it is there for all to see. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=280.88s)]
*  The Trump administration is not hiding it. The Trump administration is a government [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=291.12s)]
*  of the billionaire class, by the billionaire class, and for the billionaire class. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=298.96000000000004s)]
*  Notwithstanding some of their rhetoric, this is a government that could care less about ordinary [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=304.96000000000004s)]
*  Americans and the working families of our country. My friends, we are no longer moving toward oligarchy. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=313.2s)]
*  We are living in an oligarchic society. Now let's take a moment and try to escape from Trump's [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=324.08000000000004s)]
*  from Trump's parallel universe, the universe that you heard tonight. And let's do something really, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=334.08s)]
*  really radical. Let's actually take a hard look at the problems that Americans are facing. Today, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=341.76s)]
*  60 percent of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. Unlike Trump, I grew up in a family [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=352.0s)]
*  that lived paycheck to paycheck, and I know something about that reality. It means that [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=358.47999999999996s)]
*  every day, every day, millions of Americans worry about how they're going to pay their rent, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=364.0s)]
*  pay for childcare, pay for a doctor's visit when they get sick. They worry about what happens when [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=369.12s)]
*  their car breaks down and they can't afford the thousand bucks it costs to get it fixed, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=375.59999999999997s)]
*  and what happens when they can't get to work because they don't have a car. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=380.88s)]
*  They worry about how they can afford to buy healthy food for their kids when the price of food [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=385.2s)]
*  is off the charts. Funny, I heard Trump speaking for 90 minutes tonight. I didn't hear one word [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=391.52s)]
*  from him about the economic reality facing 60 percent of our people or the enormous stress [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=399.52s)]
*  that they are living under. 90-minute speech, not one word about the economic reality [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=407.91999999999996s)]
*  facing American workers, but that's not all. Today in America, everyone knows that our health care [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=414.15999999999997s)]
*  system is broken. It is dysfunctional, and it is outrageously expensive. We remain the only wealthy [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=421.28s)]
*  nation on earth, not to guarantee health care. I just felt like I couldn't. I didn't feel like I [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=429.68s)]
*  could. I see what AOC has to say. I've heard Bernie Sanders, he's saying the same stuff he's been [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=441.6s)]
*  saying. That being said, I know different people had different takes on it. In terms of the House [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=446.72s)]
*  of Representatives, I'll give you an alternative perspective. In terms of the House of Representatives, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=455.28s)]
*  some people feel, and it is true, that the State of the Union occurs in the House of Representatives, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=468.32s)]
*  known as the People's House. Technically, in terms of the proceedings of the State of the Union, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=475.12s)]
*  an interesting thing about the House is that it is different chamber in that only House members [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=486.40000000000003s)]
*  are typically allowed in the House of Representatives. I'm not going to lie. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=495.76s)]
*  Anybody else that is brought into the House that walks into the House has to be invited. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=501.28s)]
*  Trump actually has to be formally invited into the House floor in order to be allowed into the House [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=510.79999999999995s)]
*  floor. Same thing with all those senators and the cabinet members, et cetera. I think other people [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=517.6s)]
*  had a certain logic, which is that this is the People's House and Trump showing up should not [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=524.32s)]
*  force the duly elected representatives of that chamber, especially those who disagree with him, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=535.36s)]
*  out. That's some of the perspective there. Anyways, I watched from home [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=541.92s)]
*  and if you did, if you didn't, honestly, and I listen to Trump. I do because he has won [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=552.48s)]
*  two presidential elections. Now, the first one was not by popular vote and the second vote, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=572.4s)]
*  he has not won more than 50% of the US electorate, but he has won these elections, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=576.64s)]
*  nevertheless. So I listened to him. I listened to what he says as an observer. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=583.12s)]
*  During your speech tonight, Trump did not have one word to say about how we are going to address [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=589.52s)]
*  the planetary crisis of climate change. The last 10 years, as most Americans know, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=597.52s)]
*  have been the warmest ever recorded and extreme weather disturbances and natural disasters [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=604.56s)]
*  have been taking place all over the world, from California to India, across Europe to North [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=610.48s)]
*  Carolina. And yet, not surprisingly, Trump had nothing to say about climate change except, I guess, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=616.64s)]
*  drill, baby, drill. Well, that's going to help a whole lot. And let's be clear, not only did Trump [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=625.52s)]
*  fail to talk about some of the most important issues facing the working class of America, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=633.6s)]
*  but the solutions, in quote, he proposed would only make a bad situation even worse. Yep, I did [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=640.08s)]
*  hear Trump talk tonight about some tax breaks for working families in terms of not taxing tips, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=650.08s)]
*  not taxing Social Security, and not taxing overtime. Fine. But that is Trump change [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=657.2s)]
*  compared to the benefits he's going to give to the 1%. And it doesn't tell the whole story [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=664.4000000000001s)]
*  about his tax policies. According to a recent study by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=671.6s)]
*  if all of Trump's so-called American first policies are acted, including his tariffs, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=678.4000000000001s)]
*  and the Democratic Party be people like Bernie Sanders. No disrespect to Bernard, but he's so old. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=685.2s)]
*  While the richest 5% in our country will see their taxes go down, way down. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=694.6400000000001s)]
*  Tonight, in so many words, Trump urged Congress to pass his big, beautiful budget. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=703.2s)]
*  Do you know what's really in it? This budget would cut Medicaid by $880 billion. Oh, I guess [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=710.32s)]
*  Trump forgot to talk about that $880 billion cut in Medicaid. According to one estimate, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=718.88s)]
*  it means that up to 36 million Americans, including millions of children, would be [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=727.12s)]
*  thrown off the health insurance they have. Hey, a 90-minute speech tonight, not one word [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=732.4s)]
*  about throwing millions of kids off of the health insurance they have. When you cut Medicaid, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=737.9200000000001s)]
*  drastically it means that nursing homes that receive two-thirds of their funding from Medicaid [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=743.44s)]
*  will either have to shut down layoff workers or significantly scale back the services they provide. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=749.0400000000001s)]
*  I do want to hear Elisa Slotkin's retort here. This is what the Democratic response is. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=755.76s)]
*  No oversight, no protections against cyber attack. No guard rails on what they do with [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=761.6800000000001s)]
*  your private data. We need a more efficient government. You want to cut waste? I'll help [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=767.52s)]
*  you do it. But change doesn't need to be chaotic or make us less safe. I'm Brian Kilme. I'm Brian [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=772.96s)]
*  Kilme. The mindless firing of people who work to protect our nuclear weapons, keep our planes from [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=778.96s)]
*  crashing and conduct the research that finds the cure for cancer. I love cutting government waste. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=783.28s)]
*  I'm a Democrat. Only to rehire them two days later. I'm a Democrat and I love cutting government [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=785.92s)]
*  waste. Please. I love firing federal. I love firing federal workers. Just give me the job. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=790.96s)]
*  I'm Elisa Slotkin. As someone who spent my whole career protecting our homeland, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=799.2800000000001s)]
*  every country deserves to know who and what is coming across its border. Period. Democrats and [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=804.0s)]
*  Republicans should all be for that. Oh my God. Securing the border without actually fixing our [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=809.6s)]
*  broken immigration system is dealing with the symptom and not the disease. America is a nation [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=814.72s)]
*  of immigrants. We need a functional system key to the needs of our economy that allows [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=820.48s)]
*  vetted people to come and work here legally. So I look forward to the president's plan on that. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=826.16s)]
*  Because here's the thing. Today's world is deeply interconnected. Migration, cyber threats, AI, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=831.76s)]
*  environmental destruction, terrorism. One nation cannot face these issues alone. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=838.48s)]
*  We need friends in all corners and our safety depends on it. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=844.0s)]
*  And President Trump loves to say peace through strength. That's actually a line he stole from [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=847.76s)]
*  Ronald Reagan. But let me tell you after the spectacle that just took place in the oval [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=853.44s)]
*  office last week, Reagan must be rolling in his grave. I hope, I hope he is. He's the devil. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=858.48s)]
*  Why? Why would a former CIA agent hype up Ronald Reagan? Fuck Ronald Reagan. Ronald [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=865.76s)]
*  Reagan can suck my dick. Moral clarity. Fuck you. And that scene in the oval office [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=870.4s)]
*  wasn't just a bad episode of reality. Oh no, Ronald Reagan is rolling his grave. I piss on [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=875.44s)]
*  his grave. What the fuck's wrong with this person? He believes in cozying up to dictators like [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=879.9200000000001s)]
*  Vladimir Putin and kicking our friends like the Canadians in the teeth. He sees American leadership [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=884.0s)]
*  as merely a series of real estate transactions. As a Cold War kid, I'm thankful it was Reagan and [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=890.32s)]
*  not Trump in office in the 1980s. Trump would have lost us the Cold War. Donald Trump's actions [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=896.96s)]
*  suggest that in his heart, he doesn't believe we're an exceptional nation. He clearly doesn't [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=903.6s)]
*  think we should lead the world. Look, America is not perfect, but I stand with the majority of [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=909.76s)]
*  Americans who believe we are still exceptional, unparalleled. And I would rather have American [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=915.0400000000001s)]
*  leadership over Chinese or Russian leadership any day of the week. Because for generations, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=920.5600000000001s)]
*  America has offered something better. Our security and our prosperity, yes, but our democracy, our [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=927.0400000000001s)]
*  if she doesn't bring up Medicaid cuts, I'm done. I can't say what I'm thinking because I will get [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=934.0s)]
*  banned again instantly. Okay. I don't care about American hegemonic power. No, no, stop. No one [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=940.4000000000001s)]
*  cares about foreign policy. Please just talk about cost of living. Let it happen. Please talk about [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=947.76s)]
*  the egg prizes. Talk about the egg prices. You fucking idiot. Talk about the egg prices, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=951.5200000000001s)]
*  talk about federal employees getting fired. Talk about the evisceration of the last [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=957.52s)]
*  bastion of middle-class jobs with good benefits. Please talk about SNAP, talk about Medicaid, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=964.64s)]
*  anything. She's like, we got to do NATO. We're a nation of strivers, risk takers, innovators. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=971.36s)]
*  And we are never satisfied. That is America's superpower. And look, I've lived and worked in [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=980.4s)]
*  many countries. I've seen democracies flicker out. I've seen what life is like when a government is [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=987.52s)]
*  rigged. You can't open a business without paying off a corrupt official. You can't criticize the [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=993.4399999999999s)]
*  guys in charge without getting a knock at the door in the middle of the night. So as much as we need [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=998.48s)]
*  responsive to our lives today, don't for one moment fool yourself that democracy isn't precious and [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1004.0799999999999s)]
*  worth saving. But how do we actually do that? I know a lot of you have been asking that question. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1009.84s)]
*  First, don't tune out. It's easy to be exhausted. But America needs you now more than ever. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1017.0400000000001s)]
*  If previous generations had not fought for this democracy, where would we be today? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1024.0s)]
*  Second, hold your elected officials, including me, accountable. Watch how they're voting. Go to town [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1029.1200000000001s)]
*  halls and demand they take action. That's as American as apple pie. Third, organize. Pick just [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1035.44s)]
*  one issue you're passionate about and engage. And doom scrolling doesn't count. Join a group that [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1042.3200000000002s)]
*  cares about your issue and act. And if you can't find one, start one. Some of the most important [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1048.56s)]
*  movements in our history have come from the bottle up. In closing, we all know that our country is [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1054.16s)]
*  going through something right now. We're not sure what the next day is going to hold. So we can [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1060.96s)]
*  fucking yell at you when you demand we do stuff. First time we've experienced significant organize [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1066.0s)]
*  like the black lives matter movement so that we can fucking humiliate you every step of the way [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1070.88s)]
*  and tell you, you are not getting any of your demands. Ultimately, we've chosen to keep changing [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1077.1200000000001s)]
*  this country for the better. But every single time we've only gotten through those moments [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1081.76s)]
*  because of two things organize organize. So I former CIA agent can infiltrate your movement and [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1087.2s)]
*  put you in jail. Organize. Oops. Don't organize in a radical socialist kind of way. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1096.0s)]
*  So thank you tonight for caring about your country. Just by watching you qualify as engaged citizens. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1103.28s)]
*  And I promise that I organize like the student protesters in my state that went to jail, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1109.44s)]
*  the principal leaders that you deserve. Good night, everyone. Bro. Okay. Here's the thing. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1113.92s)]
*  Okay. This was a, a classic, classic, well-spoken boring as I want to do homework as [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1119.28s)]
*  democratic speech. Okay. Donald Trump is over there juggling on stage. Okay. He's doing tricks. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1129.04s)]
*  He's like pulling up flashcards. He's got pizzazz. He's like, we're going to kill [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1137.0400000000002s)]
*  every transgender Guatemalan migrant. And here is a victim of transgender Guatemalan migrant crime. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1143.6000000000001s)]
*  Okay. He's dumbing down the rhetoric one because he's dumb and two because I mean, he's just a, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1152.8000000000002s)]
*  he's a television guy. Okay. Meanwhile, Democrats are like, I want to cut government. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1160.96s)]
*  I hate wasteful spending in the federal government. Do not concede on your opponent's framing. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1166.3200000000002s)]
*  Okay. Do not, do not do that. Do not do that. Do not ever do that. Why are you doing that? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1173.8400000000001s)]
*  Why are you handing it to the Republicans? What's wrong with you? It's like, I just don't understand [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1180.24s)]
*  it. Hi. Of hiding under the covers. The stakes are just too high. Let us never forget. Real change [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1186.16s)]
*  only occurs when ordinary people stand up by the millions against oppression and injustice [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1199.8400000000001s)]
*  and fight back. That is the history of the founding of our nation when brave men and women took on [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1210.48s)]
*  the mighty invincible British Empire. It is the history of the abolitionist movement, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1220.24s)]
*  the history of the labor movement, the history of the civil rights movement, the women's movement, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1229.1200000000001s)]
*  the environmental movement, and the gay rights movement. Yes. Bernie's woke and gay. The oligarchs [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1235.6s)]
*  are enormously powerful. I deal with them every day. I know that. Yes, they have endless amounts [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1244.32s)]
*  of money. Yes, they control our economy and they own much of the media. They have enormous influence [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1252.56s)]
*  over our political system. But from the bottom of my heart, I am convinced- Bernie was there when [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1263.6000000000001s)]
*  the American Revolution happened. Put some respect on it. If we stand together and not let them divide [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1272.88s)]
*  us up by the color of our skin or where we were born or our religion or the language we speak [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1279.7600000000002s)]
*  or our sexual orientation, if we bring our people together around an agenda that works for the many [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1288.6399999999999s)]
*  and not just a few, there is nothing in the world that can stop us. We can win. We will win. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1297.52s)]
*  Let us go forward together. Thank you all very much. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1310.32s)]
*  How is this like, I'm sorry, I love Bernie, but God damn, we got like, like the only coherent [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1314.8799999999999s)]
*  response is coming from an 800 year old man like- Lost and defeated by Donald Trump. It's just- [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1321.6799999999998s)]
*  It looks to me like they're even more lost and even more defeated than when the speech started. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1328.8s)]
*  Well, there was a- Oh, sorry. There was a clear juxtaposition. So I thought- [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1332.48s)]
*  I hate this asshole. I hate that he, I hate this scene that just brings him on to just gloat about [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1335.6s)]
*  how sick the Republicans are over and over again. We saw the theatrics tonight in the chamber are [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1341.2s)]
*  not being well received. And as we saw recently at the DNC candidate forum, it didn't sound like [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1346.72s)]
*  that. It didn't sound like pocketbook issues. It didn't sound like saying, you know, my neighbors [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1351.68s)]
*  might support Trump, but that doesn't mean you're a bad person. They continually elevate people who [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1355.28s)]
*  are leaning as Republicans have, but into the name calling into the demonizing and filing articles [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1359.8400000000001s)]
*  of impeachment a few weeks in. If Democrats talk like a listless, they're not going to be able to [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1364.8s)]
*  win that. I don't know. I just certainly, certainly people don't. So just one second. Certainly people [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1369.12s)]
*  who don't like name calling would have gravitated to the president's speech tonight. Yeah. I guess [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1378.08s)]
*  I just think that they're talking about the optics. Donald Trump just gave a campaign speech in the [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1383.12s)]
*  joint address. It was not a unifying speech. And I don't really think that a lot of people want that [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1389.04s)]
*  version of what a listless lock and just gave. I think we're past that. Damn, they're ripping [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1395.68s)]
*  into a listless lock and okay. Maybe we could. She started her telling her personal story, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1399.76s)]
*  working for a Democrat and Republican growing up in a house, Democrat and Republican, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1404.96s)]
*  winning a district Democrat and Republican. But that you wouldn't know that from Donald Trump's [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1409.92s)]
*  speech tonight. He's not talking Democrat and Republicans. I'm not going to say what the [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1415.6000000000001s)]
*  Democrats did with tonight was it didn't feel like a cohesive strategy walking out, staying in paddles, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1419.3600000000001s)]
*  whatever. That's not, that was not how you land the plane. But I do think she laid out the issues [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1423.92s)]
*  that are important to people and she told people what to do. I don't think this problem honestly [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1430.0800000000002s)]
*  in the Democratic Party is going to be solved in Washington, D.C. It's going to be solved in the [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1434.72s)]
*  middle of the country, in the South, where people are going to organize together and tell the party [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1439.28s)]
*  what they want and the direction they want to go. Let's bring in Doug Brinkley into our conversation, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1444.64s)]
*  presidential historian. Doug, you know, it is unprecedented. It's not just in the length of [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1448.8000000000002s)]
*  the speech that we just watched from the president. Now we, of course, just saw the Democratic [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1452.96s)]
*  rebuttal from Senator Slotkin. But it was, it was also the disarray among the Democratic response. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1457.2s)]
*  And, and how unprecedented was this moment that we just sat through? Anybody who sat through and [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1464.8s)]
*  watched the entire thing? I think President Trump did what he needed to do. But as Senator Slotkin [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1470.08s)]
*  just pointed out, the economic issues weren't really talked about. I mean, the big concern right [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1479.2s)]
*  now is Medicaid and Medicare, Social Security, what Trump's going to do. The fact that Wall [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1485.1200000000001s)]
*  Street is just diving right now. If he refuses to budge on these tariffs, the chance, the matter is, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1490.72s)]
*  you're going to start losing momentum. But Trump seemed relaxed. He had, had I think a better night [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1497.68s)]
*  than the Democrats. They were like, just, I guess everybody left to their own. I mean, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1504.4s)]
*  Senator Wyden made the right to stay in Oregon and do town halls. However, Slotkin pulled a rabbit [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1510.0s)]
*  out of her hat. That was a very brilliant, relaxed response. And Andy Beshear and her should be the [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1516.4s)]
*  voices, I think, coming from the heartland of America. And I think Donald Trump left farmers [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1522.8000000000002s)]
*  from the speech a little bit out of it in a way that he needed to address them as a group in [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1528.88s)]
*  a more upbeat way. Instead of saying suffer some more, more pain, it'll be slow. Well, you know, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1534.24s)]
*  when it started out, so anybody watching at the beginning, you know, there was that complete sort [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1539.76s)]
*  of that chaotic moment. And Al Green is stabbing his cane into the air and then get it appears to [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1543.92s)]
*  be over something with Medicaid. And I'm willing to bet every single peer, every single normal human [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1551.2s)]
*  actually likes what Al Green did. And the Democrats are going to make it seem like he was really [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1557.44s)]
*  fucked up for doing so. Al Green demonstrated courage. Yes, he waved this fucking cane around [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1562.32s)]

*  wrong with these people. Every Democrat should be standing up and being like, you want to cut [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1576.24s)]
*  Medicaid over my fucking dead body. Okay. Yeah. He was awesome. He was dope. That's my expectation. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1580.72s)]
*  Why the fuck is it an 800 year old man from Houston that is leading the charge here and virtually [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1589.76s)]

*  All right. Well, Doug, you know, just coming back here to the group here, David, you know, when [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1608.32s)]

*  he talked about social issues versus not. There was a lot of social issues, right? There was a [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1616.16s)]
*  lot of wokeness wokeness is dead. Wokeness is gone. This is a good thing. If you think Trump is a [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1620.72s)]

*  that sounds? Meanwhile, we have hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have not been [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1634.64s)]
*  showing up to work. My administration will reclaim power from this unaccountable bureaucracy [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1642.96s)]
*  and we will restore true democracy to America again. And any federal bureaucrat who resists [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1649.5200000000002s)]
*  this change will be removed from office immediately because we are draining the swamp. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1655.68s)]
*  It's very simple. And the days of rule by unelected bureaucrats are over. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1664.0s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't see Elon Musk standing and cheering for that. Listen, I think that the [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1670.72s)]
*  president met his political, probably many of his political imperatives. He touched all the hot [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1678.64s)]

*  you get into the details of what you're cutting that it gets stickier. And certainly there's a [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1695.36s)]
*  strong feeling in this country about immigration and the border and I thought he leaned into that. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1700.9599999999998s)]
*  Some of the social hot buttons, you know, I said earlier, you know, there's no doubt that, you know, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1707.04s)]

*  biggest single issue facing people in their lives is the economy. And what we've seen is that 75% [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1717.6799999999998s)]
*  of people think the economy is fair or poor. Here's the interview Al Green gave to C-SPAN [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1724.8s)]
*  after getting kicked out. Okay, fuck all this noise. Let's take a look at what he did. Okay. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1730.6399999999999s)]
*  The president said he had a mandate and I was making it clear to the president that he has [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1743.52s)]
*  no mandate to cut Medicaid. I have people who are very fearful. These are poor people and they have [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1749.12s)]
*  only Medicaid in their lives when it comes to their health care. And I want him to know [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1757.04s)]
*  that his budget calls for deep cuts in Medicaid. He needs to save Medicaid, protect it. We need to [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1762.7199999999998s)]

*  district depend on. And this president seems to care less about them. I love that. And more about [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1780.9599999999998s)]
*  the number of people that he can remove from the various programs that have been so helpful to so [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1787.28s)]

*  incivility against our civility. He is a person who has consistently been used incivility against [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1802.88s)]
*  civility. I'm willing to suffer whatever punishment is available to me. I didn't say to anyone, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1810.5600000000002s)]

*  And sometimes yes, that involves being a little disruptive. The base is so desperate for any sort [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1846.24s)]

*  Medicaid. None. Is the only punishment that you were kicked out, sir? Is there something? [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1884.4s)]
*  I don't know. Whatever the punishment is, I'm not fighting the punishment. This is about the people [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1889.6000000000001s)]
*  who are being punished by virtue of losing their health care. This is the richest country in the [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1895.1200000000001s)]

*  from saying he's going to take Greenland. He just said, if Greenland wants to join us, they can, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1991.36s)]
*  which weirdly enough is like, I guess nicer than saying we are going to forcibly take [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=1998.1599999999999s)]
*  Greenland. Greenland is now ours. You know, also this would, this would probably kill half of the, [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=2003.28s)]

*  So glad we legalize comedy. No, he's wrong. The president does in fact have a mandate from [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=2049.76s)]
*  the American people to govern and do what they elected him to do. He won the electoral college [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=2053.76s)]
*  and won the popular vote. He literally has the mandate. No, but okay. If we're going to get down [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=2057.84s)]
*  to the semantics of this point, he's not saying the president hasn't doesn't have the mandate to [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=2063.36s)]
*  run the country. He's saying the president doesn't have the mandate to cut Medicaid. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=2068.4s)]
*  And as a matter of fact, he didn't run on cutting Medicaid. He ran on preserving Medicaid and Medicare. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=2073.44s)]
*  Okay. So what are we talking about? He's doing a bunch of stuff. He ran on, I don't know what [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r926esA_HcQ&t=2079.04s)]
