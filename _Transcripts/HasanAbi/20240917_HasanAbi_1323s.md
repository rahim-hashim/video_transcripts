# JD Vance's Desperate Explanation | Hasanabi React
**HasanAbi:** [September 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs)
*  Whoa! How dare you! Excuse me! I'm simply reading the prominent works of a German author! [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm a god dang patriot, ma'am! [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=10.16s)]
*  Nothing funnier than just like objectively white people in America getting so ass mad. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=13.52s)]
*  I want to shift to another topic. I've been talking to allies of former President Trump, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=18.56s)]
*  who are frankly outraged, they're alarmed. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=27.92s)]
*  Yeah, Vance says he does not like the comments Laura Loomer made on Kamala Harris's Indian [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=31.12s)]
*  heritage. Here's Vance also committing a little bit of hate speech right here, okay? Get ready [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=34.800000000000004s)]
*  for it, guy. Generational run for just, you know, a dude that people hate more every time they see [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  him. Donald Trump has been traveling with Laura Loomer. She is someone who says she supports [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  white nationalism. She's read conspiracy theories, including that the September 11th attacks are an [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=54.56s)]
*  inside job. She recently said that Kamala Harris, whose mother was Indian, if she wins in November, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=59.92s)]
*  quote, the White House will smell like curry. Senator, you are married to an Indian American [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=66.8s)]
*  woman. What was your reaction to hearing those comments specifically? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=75.28s)]
*  Well, Kristen, I want to go back to what you said about Haitian migrants to begin with, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=78.88s)]
*  because you didn't give me a chance to respond. Look, we don't blame the Haitian migrants for [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=82.24s)]
*  coming to Springfield. We blame Kamala Harris for opening the American southern border and inviting [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  20,000 people to get dropped in a small Ohio town. Now you asked about Laura Loomer. Look, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  Laura Loomer is not affiliated with the Trump campaign. She said something about curry in the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=97.36s)]
*  White House that I first read about this morning, actually, because I knew that you would ask me [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=102.32s)]
*  about it. Look, Kristen, I make a mean chicken curry. I don't think that it's insulting for [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  anybody to talk about their dietary preferences or what they want to do in the White House. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=111.76s)]
*  I think what Laura said about Kamala Harris is not what we should be focused on. We should be [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=115.92s)]
*  focused on the policy and on. Yeah, that's what that's what she was saying. That's crazy, bro. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=120.16000000000001s)]
*  You have no respect for your wife. Like straight up. You're such a piece of you're such a cowardly [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=126.4s)]
*  little you don't give a dog. That's crazy, bro. His wife is literally an Indian woman. Okay, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=131.12s)]
*  that's that does just straight up like she being like, oh, she's Indian. She smells like curry. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=136.88s)]
*  That's what she's saying. It's like entry level that like a 12 year old would say, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=141.12s)]
*  but what are we doing? You think it's actually about the dietary preferences? But wait, there's [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=145.68s)]
*  more speaking on dietary preferences, the issues, not what we share preferences or what they want [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=150.56s)]
*  to do in the White House. I think what Laura said about Kamala Harris is not what we should be [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  focused on. We should be focused on the policy and on the issues. And look, so yeah, do I agree [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  with what Laura Loomer said about Kamala Harris? No, I don't. I also don't think that this is [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=166.64s)]
*  actually an issue of national import. Is Laura Loomer running for president? No, Kamala Harris [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=171.67999999999998s)]
*  is running for president. And whether you're eating curry at your chicken at your dinner table, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=176.64s)]
*  or fried chicken, things have gotten more expensive. Thanks to her policy. There's nothing [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=181.44s)]
*  funnier than him being like, yeah, I'm actually going to be anti black as well. Like, why did you [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=186.16s)]
*  say fried chicken there? You couldn't say hamburgers? Like, what are you doing? What are [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=191.68s)]
*  you doing? What are you doing? Why? Why? Like, how bad can it get, dude? He said, I don't think we [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=196.56s)]
*  should be focusing on what Laura Loomer said. But honestly, my criticism of Laura Loomer is that he [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=202.72s)]
*  also didn't bring up fried chicken. Because Kamala Harris is not just Indian. She's a black woman as [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=208.08s)]
*  well. Like, that's literally what he did. He just turned around and was like, here's my trick. I [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=213.68s)]
*  think we should be more diverse in our tactics. That's awesome. Let's talk about the person running [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=219.44s)]
*  for president of the United States, not a social media personality who supports Donald Trump. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=227.44s)]
*  Senator, were you and your wife offended? And do you disavow those comments that even some Trump [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  allies say are blatantly Christian? I just told you, I don't like those comments. And I think that we [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  ought to be focused on Kamala Harris's policy failures. I also don't look at the internet. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=242.64s)]
*  She didn't even say nothing about the fried chicken comment. She was moved on. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=247.44s)]
*  JD Vance recently topped this performance, if we can believe that. Wait, what? No way. There's no [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=251.12s)]
*  way he topped that last performance. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=256.71999999999997s)]
*  Kamala Harris has been chaos all over the world. She can't answer a single question without sounding like a [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=258.4s)]
*  whatever. And she has led, she's had this... [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=263.92s)]
*  Hello? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=267.84s)]
*  Yeah, by the way... [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=268.72s)]
*  The fuck's he saying? What is this man on, bro? He is, he drank the dumbass juice. Like, every time [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=269.6s)]
*  he's on camera, it is alarming how bad he is at his job. Alarming. Libzo TikTok spreads falsehood [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=276.32s)]
*  about Haitian immigrants in Pennsylvania. A Republican state senator who's a fan of Libzo [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=282.64s)]
*  TikTok is like, hey, that's my region. What you're saying is not true. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=285.44s)]
*  ...way with close to 500 patriots in the state of Michigan in this building right now and outside. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=288.15999999999997s)]
*  I'd like to see an assassin try to come in this room. They come to the wrong place if you try to [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=295.36s)]
*  walk into this place right now. You know, by the way, with close to 500 patriots in the state of [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=299.36s)]
*  Michigan in this building right now and outside, I'd like... [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=306.24s)]
*  This is so funny, bro. He's so lame that even like, psychos who want to make a name for themselves [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=308.88s)]
*  give enough of a fuck to him or attempt to fuck him. Like, ain't nobody trying to fuck you, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=316.8s)]
*  little bro. It's not happening, okay? Stop begging for it. He's like, come on, please, please, please, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=320.64s)]
*  please. It'd be so sick. That's crazy. When you're such a loser that people don't even care enough to [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=326.48s)]
*  try and fuck you. Also, if somebody tried to fuck him or if somebody successfully [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=331.35999999999996s)]
*  let him come in this room, they come to the wrong place, Trump would literally celebrate if somebody [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=336.88s)]
*  tried to fuck him. If he actually was, he would be like, oh, thank God, dude. Thank God I made a [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=342.0s)]
*  mistake. Also, here's Donald Trump. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=347.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, but they're animals. The Democrats say, please don't call them animals. They're humans. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=361.28s)]
*  I said, no, they're not. Yeah. The haters are going to get so much worse, by the way. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=365.52s)]
*  You said this, quote, Trump makes people I care about afraid, immigrants, Muslims, et cetera. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=368.88s)]
*  Because of this, I find him reprehensible. God wants better of us. This week in Springfield, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=375.68s)]
*  buildings were closed because of threats. Haitian immigrants say they are afraid for their lives. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=381.12s)]
*  Are you now doing the very thing you once called reprehensible, Senator? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=386.64s)]
*  Well, first of all, Kristen, we condemn all acts of violence and all threats of violence. But, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=391.04s)]
*  Kristen, the reason that I changed my mind on Donald Trump is actually perfectly highlighted [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=395.76s)]
*  by what's going on in Springfield because the media and the Kamala Harris campaign, they've been [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=401.03999999999996s)]
*  calling the residents of Springfield. They've been lying about them. They've been saying that [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=406.0s)]
*  they've make up these reports of migrants eating geese and they completely ignore the public health [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=409.84s)]
*  disaster that is unfolding in Springfield at this very minute. Senator, what about the Haitian [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=415.2s)]
*  immigrants who say- I mean, the media is not calling the Springfielders racist. They're calling you. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=420.15999999999997s)]
*  They probably should call the Springfielders- I mean, it's probably better that they're not [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=423.84s)]
*  calling the Springfielders because Americans get really touchy about that sort of thing. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=427.12s)]
*  Like, you'll have a dude, you know, reciting their new copy of Mein Kampf. And you'll be like, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=430.48s)]
*  hey man, what do you want? Nazi will be like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, how dare you? Excuse me. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=437.76s)]
*  I'm simply reading the prominent works of a German author. I'm a god dang patriot, ma'am. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=446.24s)]
*  Nothing funnier than just like objectively white people in America getting so ass mad, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=454.72s)]
*  what do you call them? It's just a mere phobia and bigotry. How scared are Haitian immigrants [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=459.36s)]
*  in Springfield after hearing former president Trump's claims? They are scared for their lives. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=466.72s)]
*  Some of them are asking me, even yesterday I got a friend calling me asking me if he has to leave [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=471.84s)]
*  because he's scared for his life. So another friend told me that it seems that he would have [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=477.35999999999996s)]
*  had some family coming to visit him, but it seems that he's going to welcome them in Columbus, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=486.56s)]
*  Dayton, because it is not safe right now for him in Springfield to welcome his family here. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=493.76s)]
*  What do you make of these claims? What does it feel like to hear politicians make these false [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=502.08s)]
*  accusations? It's very shocking and sad at the same time, especially coming from people seeking [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=507.44s)]
*  the high office of our land, high ranking people. I think they should do better. They have everything [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=513.92s)]
*  at their disposal to check the veracity of anything that they hear. They say that they are [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=520.08s)]
*  high educated people who attended great university. I mean, they know how to check something to see [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=525.5200000000001s)]
*  the veracity of it. Jade Evans has a more wild shit in this interview. Oh my God, what else? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=531.2800000000001s)]
*  I forget exactly which official it was within the European Union, but sent Elon this threatening [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=536.8000000000001s)]
*  letter that basically said, we're going to arrest you if you platform Donald Trump, who by the way, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=542.4000000000001s)]
*  is the likely next president of the United States. So what America should be saying is, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=549.04s)]
*  oh, if NATO wants us to continue supporting them and NATO wants us to continue to be a good [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=553.68s)]
*  participant in this military alliance, why don't you respect American values and respect free speech? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=560.0799999999999s)]
*  Excuse me. It's insane that we would support a military alliance if that military alliance [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=564.9599999999999s)]
*  isn't going to be pro-free speech. I think we can do both, but we've got to say American power comes [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=570.4s)]
*  with certain strings attached. One of those is respect free speech, especially in our Europe. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=575.28s)]
*  He's like, no, you have to let people say and do hate. Like you literally, you it's not even just [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=580.24s)]
*  about like American free speech. You have to be able to openly sig-hile in Germany if you want our [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=586.64s)]
*  support. Now, of course, that's really stupid for him to say because like, obviously, our loyalty [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=591.8399999999999s)]

*  moment. You know, as you know, there is always bipartisan support for American imperialism and [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=601.76s)]
*  NATO of course is one of the most in one of the most consequential vectors of said imperialism. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=608.08s)]
*  Was it even NATO? He said EU? No, he's talking about NATO. You are an L. Shut the f*** up. Oh, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=615.4399999999999s)]
*  hell yeah. We got some Republicans in the chat. Imagine having to defend this guy. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=620.56s)]
*  European allies. Like, look, I'm not going to go to some backwoods country and tell them how to live [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=625.04s)]
*  their lives, but European countries should theoretically share American values, especially [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=630.24s)]
*  about some very basic things like free speech. The leader, I forget exactly which official it was [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=635.44s)]
*  within the European Union, but sent- That's awesome. Donald Trump believes, Kristen, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=641.44s)]
*  Donald, let me finish this point, Kristen, and feel free to follow up. Donald Trump is the only [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=646.96s)]
*  person who brought Springfield to national attention and is the only president who's going [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=651.44s)]
*  to fight for the residents, not just their right to live. What's really funny is Donald Trump [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=656.08s)]
*  brought Springfield to national attention and also now they're getting threats. It's kind of wild [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=662.1600000000001s)]
*  that he's just like saying, this little town that sucks and I hate them, even though they're my [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=668.4000000000001s)]
*  constituents and I haven't served them well is now in prominent display of the entire American Nazi [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=675.76s)]
*  movement and now they're just getting consistent threats. Why? Because I fabricated stories about [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=683.28s)]
*  the Haitian migrants there, you know, in an effort to get people to pay attention. What did they do [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=690.0799999999999s)]
*  after they started paying attention? Threats. Safely in their communities, but for their right [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=695.92s)]
*  to complain about what's going on in their own community. I think it's disgraceful that Kamala [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=700.56s)]
*  Harris has heard these complaints, has decided to call people instead of actually trying to make [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=705.8399999999999s)]
*  their lives better by undoing her open border. But I know you had a question. Well, and Senator, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=710.72s)]
*  again, because we're almost out of time, but Haitian immigrants are saying they're afraid for their [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=715.36s)]
*  lives. I want to shift to another topic. I've been talking to allies of former President Trump who [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=718.88s)]
*  are frankly in place. What I hear you're saying is Obamacare stays in place. Let me move to [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=724.8000000000001s)]
*  another topic. There was a lot of attention, as you know, this week on former President Trump's [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=731.28s)]
*  baseless claims about migrants eating pets in Springfield, Ohio claims you first shared [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=736.48s)]
*  online, Senator, earlier this week, local authorities now say there have been no credible [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=742.32s)]
*  reports of migrants hurting pets or animals. And in fact, neo-Nazis are now taking credit, frankly, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=749.04s)]
*  for pushing these rumors mainstream. Why are you continuing to double and triple down on these [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=756.08s)]
*  baseless claims? Well, two important points here, Kristen. First of all, I have heard firsthand from [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=761.6s)]
*  it's like two important points. One, those neo-Nazis are my constituents. Two, weirdly enough, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=767.52s)]
*  those Haitians are not my constituents, even though they technically are two important points. Have [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=774.48s)]
*  you considered that I'm a Nazi multiple constituents, people who made 911 calls a month ago, a year ago, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=779.36s)]
*  who are making these complaints. I trust my constituents more than I do the American media [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=785.6800000000001s)]
*  that has shown no interest in what's happened in Springfield until we started sharing cat memes on [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=790.64s)]
*  the internet, which is disgraceful that the American media ignored this town. And that's the [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=796.0s)]
*  most important part. Bro, you're the Senator of Ohio. Like Springfield being in a state of disrepair [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=800.2399999999999s)]
*  is like directly your fault. It's so weird. Like how are people just acting like he's not the Senator? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=807.4399999999999s)]
*  He is not. Dog, you are not some random guy. You are the Senator, dude. Like beyond the goddamn [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=814.7199999999999s)]
*  mayor. Okay. And the governor, you're like the third responsible guy. Okay. You and the [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=822.56s)]
*  representative representing whatever district it lands on are the guys who are responsible at the [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=831.52s)]
*  federal level to bring back funds to Springfield. It just doesn't make any sense. Like how are you [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=839.6s)]
*  just openly on your own state? Why is nobody asking this question? Like, are you talking about [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=847.1999999999999s)]
*  Kamala Harris being the border czar? Okay. And that's valid. I mean, the arguments that you're [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=853.84s)]
*  launching against Kamala Harris are invalid or the arguments against immigration are invalid. But [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=860.3199999999999s)]
*  using that saying that like she's the border czar, she's responsible for the problems that I [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=864.56s)]
*  perceive of immigration. Like, okay, well then you're the czar of Springfield, dog. You're the [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=869.52s)]
*  Ohio czar, except you're not the Ohio czar. You're the Ohio Senator. The term we actually use. You [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=874.0799999999999s)]
*  were voted. You're voting to power. Kamala Harris's open border, Kristen, has led to us in Springfield [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=880.56s)]
*  rising rates of rising rates of communicable diseases. They have dropped 20,000 immigrants [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=886.88s)]
*  into a town of 40,000 and it's caused a coast of social problems. And we should be talking about [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=892.88s)]
*  why Kamala Harris has done this to this small town and the media and the Democrats ignored it [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=898.72s)]
*  for an entire year. Kristen, I was talking about this on the Senate Banking Committee months ago. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=904.64s)]
*  Nobody would pay attention to it until we start. The other question I would ask is, it's your state. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=910.32s)]
*  You're lying about them spreading communicable diseases. It's like insanely that you're saying [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=915.84s)]
*  that. But also beyond that, it didn't seem like you had an issue with bringing in migrants from [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=920.8s)]
*  other states into your project that you launched in Appalachia, the startup farm project that you [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=927.04s)]
*  launched, just like you didn't have a problem underpaying the employees at the time, and then [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=933.52s)]
*  also replacing them with migrant help. So which is it? Like, what's going on here? Because in [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=938.64s)]
*  your personal life, you have done this. You've done the thing that you're complaining about in [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=945.12s)]
*  Springfield. And especially in Springfield, there was a need for extra hands. There was a need for [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=949.04s)]
*  help. That's why the Haitians went there. Whereas you brought in a startup to an area, and then you [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=954.16s)]
*  bust migrants into the area specifically because you didn't want to... You felt like the white [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=961.12s)]
*  Americans weren't doing the job. Started sharing the 911 calls of people in Springfield saying, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=966.64s)]
*  the migrants are eating the geese. I think that's really, really shameful that no one cared about it [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=972.24s)]
*  or paid attention to it. And yet, Senator officials, the mayor, other local officials have said, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=977.36s)]
*  there's just no evidence of what you're saying, that it's baseless, those claims. Can't you just [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=983.12s)]
*  make your argument about immigration without making those claims, Senator? Why not just make an argument [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=988.24s)]
*  about immigration? Why do you have to delve into repeating these baseless claims that, again, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=994.08s)]
*  Senator, have been repeated by neo-Nazis? Kristin, I hear you saying that they're baseless, but I'm not [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=999.04s)]
*  repeating them because I invented them out of thin air. I'm repeating them because my constituents [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=1005.12s)]
*  are saying these things are happening. I mean, just yesterday, a video came out of a migrant [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=1009.5999999999999s)]
*  30 miles away eating a cat. Clearly, these rumors are out. I like that he just quintuples down [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=1014.56s)]
*  with more fake. He's like, no, dog, that's not a real thing to happen. You saw a video, and because [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=1021.52s)]
*  you're so goddamn... You went with... Well, and also fully aware that no one will actually care [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=1027.84s)]
*  in your constituents. I hate this shit so much, dude. There's such ginormous pieces. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=1033.84s)]
*  The worst part about it is that this is a solid thing to do for immigration. There are so many [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=1063.84s)]
*  parts of this country that are in a state of utter disrepair, and the real goal should be [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=1073.6s)]
*  integration programs and allowing a lot of these migrants to go there and revitalize these towns. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=1079.6799999999998s)]
*  It is a success story every time it happens. There's not a single instance where migrants came in [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=1086.56s)]
*  to a state or a city, and then that city went to... It's actually capitalists that leave the town [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=1092.72s)]
*  behind that turned this into a state of disrepair. That's why there's so many forgotten ghost towns [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=1099.04s)]
*  in this goddamn country. And then migrants come in, and then they work the jobs, and they are the [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=1103.92s)]
*  necessary labor force. And then the town starts increasing its taxable revenue, which is exactly [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=1110.5600000000002s)]
*  what happened in Springfield. 33% increase in taxable revenue in Springfield, Ohio, year over [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=1115.76s)]
*  year. And then now they have more funds. If they don't use all of those funds on the police, even [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=1121.92s)]
*  though they usually do, some of those funds go back to community programs and things of that nature, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=1127.44s)]
*  fixing the potholes and the like. And slowly but surely, these towns actually end up revitalizing [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=1132.32s)]
*  themselves. This is precisely what happened in Hazelton, Pennsylvania. This is what's happening [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=1139.28s)]
*  in Springfield right now. But these guys are so... These guys at the tippy top, Mr. Meinlolli [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=1144.56s)]
*  right here. They're so... I mean, JD Vance himself is just doing for a very specific reason. He [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=1151.36s)]
*  doesn't give a... If someone is Haitian or not, he doesn't give a... If someone is Indian or not, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=1157.9199999999998s)]
*  he went to Yale, okay? He's a goddamn Yale graduate. He had a trans best friend. He called [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=1161.9199999999998s)]
*  Trump Adolf Hitler like four years ago. What the are we talking about? Or not four years ago, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=1169.36s)]
*  in 2016, eight years ago. He's a goddamn grifter. He doesn't give a... about any of this stuff. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=1174.08s)]
*  He just knows that there are a lot of right-wing idiots out there who will go, hell yeah, brother. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=1178.24s)]
*  It's actually not my boss that's stealing my dollars. It's actually the goddamn Haitian [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=1186.0s)]
*  migrant down the street. It's like you're an idiot, okay? You're a dumbass. That's it. These guys use... [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=1190.96s)]
*  These guys weaponize racial animus like this to move people away from the main point of contention [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=1198.48s)]
*  like the top of the hour ad break, okay? They just don't want you to be reminded that at the top of [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=1205.1200000000001s)]
*  the hour, there's a three-minute ad break. Now, if you no longer want to see those ads, all you need [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=1210.72s)]
*  to do is subscribe, okay? JD Vance got a former professor to delete a blog post Vance wrote in [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=1214.3200000000002s)]
*  2012, attacking GOP over anti-immigrant rhetoric. Yeah, it's the careful mate that foreigner wants [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=1219.76s)]
*  your cookie. That's the Rupert meme. That's it. It's a story as old as time, okay? This is precisely [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=1224.96s)]
*  at the heart of the problem. You're experiencing it right now. It's happening right now. So you're [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=1235.8400000000001s)]
*  maybe hopefully noticing how this works. An example I used to use or something I used to talk about [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=1241.44s)]
*  with like Sweden being insanely anti-refugee, insanely anti-Muslim. And they still are by the [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=1246.88s)]
*  way, but they got really they got this way because of austerity. Okay, they got this way because of [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=1252.56s)]
*  austerity. Some of the social safety nets that they used to rely on became increasingly worse. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=1259.6799999999998s)]
*  And in that process, a lot of these right wing charlatans who wanted to make right wing anti-immigrant [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=1265.76s)]
*  narratives, they pumped, they flood the market with like anti-Muslim Islamophobic. It worked [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=1272.48s)]
*  really well. The real problem obviously was austerity. It's so funny to think that like [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=1278.96s)]
*  this kind of like tribalistic sentiment is the oldest trick in the book. And yet people still, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=1285.28s)]
*  people still just refuse to recognize with it. Okay, internet for every single thing to get [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbu5M2p4zs&t=1291.04s)]
