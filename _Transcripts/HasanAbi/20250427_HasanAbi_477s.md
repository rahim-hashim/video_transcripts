*  That's you, huh? I had a feeling. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=85.12s)]
*  Where did I hear you? Yours on... [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=88.32000000000001s)]
*  I've seen you on a few podcasts, I believe. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  Maybe. The Yvonne? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=92.88000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, dude. I love the Yvonne. You're doing card? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  Oh, Apple Pay. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=102.88000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you got a cool mind, bro. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=104.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  There you have it, folks. Right below the fold. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=106.44s)]
*  Living and eating in the hyper flavor era. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=109.84s)]
*  Across the great streamer divide. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=113.4s)]
*  There it is. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=116.55999999999999s)]
*  Of course it was the Yvonne. No, he actually told me after. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=118.24s)]
*  He loves, he loves Schultz. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. New boy, boy. Israel strikes Beirut. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  We got, we got so much. We got so much primo today. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=129.6s)]
*  How you always get to have to have the shirt off, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=135.84s)]
*  but can't sit in a tub with Austin. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=137.6s)]
*  It's not the, it's not the same when my shirt is off with, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=139.28s)]
*  you know, I control the shirt off situation. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=142.72s)]
*  We've been the author of the New York times piece. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=146.0s)]
*  Yeah. Back in January, I did leg day with the song, the hunt for New York time styles, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  hoping to figure out what it means to be a left-wing man in a red pill world. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=152.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's great. We're obviously going to read the article. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=156.88s)]
*  We're obviously going to read the article, but devoid of substance, pushback and critical [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=162.0s)]
*  thinking one has to wonder how much does something like this cost? The majority of your other work [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=166.95999999999998s)]
*  is quite good to be honest. And wait, what is this? Perhaps due diligence in the future [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=170.16s)]
*  would prevent you from looking like a page show. Unfortunately, it's a little late for that. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=174.4s)]
*  Here's a clip of some protest dog whistles, less than 24 hours old, which should be setting alarm [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=178.08s)]
*  bells in your head because you cleared, you know, it was really funny about this. Like, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=182.16s)]
*  like this guy thinks that a whole ass reporter for the rolling stones in New York times [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=186.8s)]
*  does not have like any worldview whatsoever that he is, he is so silly and so malleable that he is [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=195.52s)]
*  going to look at like a stalker account and go, Oh my God, what have I done? What a devastating, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=202.24s)]
*  what a devastating mistake for me. Yeah. Thank God. Thank God. These guys do the real journalism [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=210.08s)]
*  now. You know, the right is already getting harassed. It's a certain person posted them [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=217.28s)]
*  on his IG. No nice things are allowed to be said about you. Yeah. They kind of did you dirty on [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=220.72s)]
*  the cover. Why? What do you mean? Chat? Look at this right now. What is this? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=225.20000000000002s)]
*  What? What the hell is this chat? Look at this right now. What's more important? Your view on [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=232.24s)]
*  politics and the man you love in a relationship, not saying you love me. It's just a general [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  question. Why I'll find someone I can do both of it because that's who I am. And I've been in [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=245.36s)]
*  relationship with conservatives. I don't want to do that again. I know some people can, but I don't [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=248.88s)]
*  think I can do that without pissing you off all the time. I'll be honest with you, Karlin, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=252.72s)]
*  no man you're sexually attracted to is going to ever want to hear about the far left agenda. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=257.28000000000003s)]
*  Why? Because you're attracted to mainly men and mainly men do not believe in far left ideas. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=261.36s)]
*  Sorry, but it is the truth. I'm attracted to girls too. There you go. Perf. Yeah, that's right. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=265.76s)]

*  Hassan. I'll be girly busted open for 20. You like mainly man. You like manly man. And that's right. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=279.84000000000003s)]

*  someone needed to finally come out and say something exposing me. My goat stinks. I smell [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=322.16s)]
*  so f**king good. It's crazy. It's the, it's the, I have a bro. My family is out of control. Okay. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=329.28000000000003s)]

*  My mom who is almost 60 years old at this point said, where can I get a copy? Like my mom is asking [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=340.72s)]

*  videos on BDBD. People like him should be quickly recruited and we can't let him raise an [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=366.72s)]
*  average IQ of Americans go to YouTube and urge him to come to China as soon as possible. Translated. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=370.64s)]
*  Oh my God. That's amazing. Hell yeah. Yeah. We'll start off with the New York Times article. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=375.36s)]

*  because that's a, that's crazy. I read it this morning. It was like 11 minutes long. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=383.03999999999996s)]
*  It's not super long. Articles written like a long ass time ago, but it finally came out. I assume, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=387.59999999999997s)]
*  I assume there was some, some setbacks considering some of my statements about Israel that had to go [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=395.84s)]
*  through the, that I, I suspect that had to go through a rigorous editorial process, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=402.24s)]
*  which, you know, a rigorous editorial process where they had to figure out how to anyway, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxe1As4Frc8&t=411.04s)]
