# Israel Is Losing Its Mind | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ)
*  Cause like the thing is Iran has been incredibly restrained to such a degree that it's obvious [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=0.0s)]
*  that they don't even really care about Palestinian humanity here. Okay. Like they are, they are [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=5.36s)]
*  the only game in town outside of the Houthis that have actually directly got Israel to [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=13.16s)]
*  stand down. Meanwhile, as meanwhile, as a European leaders are finally applying a little [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=19.88s)]
*  bit of pressure to Israel, just like marginal, just a little baby amount of pressure. Here [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=32.8s)]
*  is what Israel is preparing for. Apparently Israel's making preparations to strike Iranian [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=39.08s)]
*  nuclear facilities. New intelligence suggests Israel's preparing possible strike on Iranian [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=44.58s)]
*  nuclear facilities. US officials say CNN, the US has obtained new intelligence suggesting [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=48.44s)]
*  that Israel's making preparations to strike Iranian nuclear facilities. Even as the Trump [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=52.4s)]
*  administration has been pursuing a diplomatic deal with Tehran, multiple US officials familiar [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=55.559999999999995s)]
*  with the latest intelligence told CNN such a strike would be a brazen break with Donald [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=59.56s)]
*  Trump. Hmm. Don't know about that. US officials said it could also risk tipping off a broader [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=64.16s)]
*  regional conflict in the middle East, something the US has sought to avoid since the war in [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=68.88s)]
*  Gaza inflamed tensions in the beginning of 2023 Israel right now strike while the iron [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=72.12s)]
*  is still hot. Yeah, they're delusional man. They are the Lulu. They have lost their minds. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=77.32s)]
*  They have lost their goddamn minds, dude. They're insane. US has obtained new intelligence [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=81.63999999999999s)]
*  suggesting that Israel's making preparations to strike Iranian nuclear facilities. Even [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=87.16s)]
*  as the Trump administration has been pursuing diplomatic ties with Tehran dot not even sure [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=90.82s)]
*  if US has actually been pursuing that by the way, such a strike would be a brazen break [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=95.28s)]
*  with president Donald Trump officials caution. It's not clear that Israeli leaders have made [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=99.83999999999999s)]
*  a final decision and that in fact there is deep disagreement within the US government [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=104.04s)]
*  about the likelihood that Israel will ultimately act whether and how Israel's strikes will [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=108.0s)]
*  likely depend on what it thinks the US negotiates with Tehran over his nuclear program, but [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=113.84s)]
*  the chance of an Israeli strike on an Iranian nuclear facility has gone up significantly [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=117.24s)]
*  in recent months. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  Dude, I swear to God, Israel is not going to stop until literally Iran just drops the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=122.03999999999999s)]
*  Israel equivalent of bombs on top of Israel. Like what are they doing? Like they already [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=132.48s)]
*  played this tit for tat before with Iran where they exploded Ismail Hani, the principal negotiator [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=139.23999999999998s)]
*  that was negotiating with Israel by the way in the hotel he was staying at in Tehran. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=148.92s)]
*  It is so crazy. Iran is not just going to attack Israel. It's going to attack oil refineries [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=154.04s)]
*  in the region if its energy grid is harmed in any meaningful capacity. They have said [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=158.94s)]
*  as much. I don't understand why Israel thinks it can do an eight front war now with an actual [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=163.85999999999999s)]
*  more powerful military. The Israeli diaper force cannot do anything outside of they can't [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=172.46s)]
*  even deal with Hezbollah and Hezbollah is still a paramilitary force. Why though do [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=180.78s)]
*  they think that the Israeli diaper force can deal with the IRGC? It's shocking to me that [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=187.01999999999998s)]
*  they are this insane. I suspect this is more of Israeli diplomacy where they just like [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=194.22s)]
*  saber-rattle with the hopes that like they can give a better hand to the United States [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=202.62s)]
*  of America. But yes, Ze Squirrel's tweet about this was seemingly correct. It's my assessment [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=206.54s)]
*  as well. I told you just as much that I suspect that this whole like back and forth between [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=212.9s)]
*  Israel and America was having with Hamas was simply just a sleight of hand. My first thought [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=221.06s)]
*  from seeing that is the US may be using Israel as a back hop so to speak in negotiations. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=226.42000000000002s)]
*  And if the US can come in and calm things down afterwards, they endear themselves to [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=230.94s)]
*  Iran more. That's what I said. That's that's the best possible scenario. That's the best [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=233.98000000000002s)]
*  possible outcome here. Having said that, however, having said that, I'm not so certain that [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=240.38s)]
*  we have cool heads, responsible parties here. I don't know. They're insane. Israel's insane [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=246.7s)]
*  and Trump is not even Trump. America is insane as well. The heightened worries stem not only [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=255.94s)]
*  from public and private messaging from senior Israeli officials that is considering such [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=262.14s)]
*  a move, but also from intercepted Israeli communications. Because like the thing is [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=264.94s)]
*  Iran has been incredibly restrained to such a degree that it's obvious that they don't [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=270.14s)]
*  even really care about Palestinian humanity here. Okay. Like they are, they are the only [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=273.46s)]
*  game in town outside of the Houthis that have actually directly got Israel to stand down. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=281.5s)]
*  So the very fact, Oh here, many gods, Israel's more moderate liberal leader advocating for [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=289.03999999999996s)]
*  the exposures of Palestinians from Gaza and says the fight against Hamas could last up [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=294.26s)]
*  to a decade. Many will ignore Gonsa statements and place blame on Palestinian rejectionism, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=297.82s)]
*  a racist trope that's meant to detract from Israel's occupation of the Palestinians. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=301.7s)]
*  The Israeli opposition leaders have frequently been attacking Netanyahu, not for war crimes, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=305.85999999999996s)]
*  but for not bombing Iran sooner, not conscripting more Haredi men into the army and for not [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=309.7s)]
*  sucking up the Trump enough. Or my favorite was when they were like, we hate you because [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=314.21999999999997s)]
*  you're not bombing Lebanon hard enough. And then when he started bombing Lebanon, they [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=320.29999999999995s)]
*  were like, okay, we don't hate you anymore. Thank you for bombing Lebanon. I need you [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=324.94s)]
*  to bomb Lebanon, please. I don't know at this point, but what I do know is Iran has been [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=328.7s)]
*  in this game for quite a while. I'm pretty sure that they're, I mean, they're very well [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=338.98s)]
*  aware of America's tricks. Okay. So I doubt that they would be open-minded to a warm, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=344.18s)]
*  like an extended hand from the Trump administration. In 1982, the CIA Mossad plan to coup to install [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=352.18s)]
*  the Shah son in Iran. According to Samuel Sigev, the plan had the approval of both the [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=359.82s)]
*  CIA and the Israeli cabinet of Menahem Bein, Begin, and only abandoned after Begin resigned [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=363.14s)]
*  in 1983. Most importantly, this plan was approved in February, 1982. That is four months before [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=370.14s)]
*  the Iranians sent the IRGC to Lebanon in June. So if anyone asks you who started the Iran-Israel [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=375.18s)]
*  proxy conflict, it was Israel. Yeah. What is this? Did you respond to this? Is this [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=379.9s)]
*  Israeli Lebanese Christian Hassan Parker from a safe Western mansion, praise the resistance [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=385.62s)]
*  that turned their guns on my people. My father fought the PLO when they attacked us. His [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=392.62s)]
*  bullet promised liberation, then assassin anyone who spoke out. We fled. Only Israel [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=396.82s)]
*  gave us refuge. You want me to respond to this dog, dude? Are you stupid? Are you okay? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=401.73999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. I don't care, man. Like what? Okay. Suck my. What's next? You're going to send [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=409.22s)]
*  Lou high, uh, Lu I, Ahmed or whatever. Look at that Yemeni dude is to be like, do you [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=414.98s)]
*  have a response to this? Are you guys so stupid? What's up? You're going to send me a Candace [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=420.78000000000003s)]
*  Owens video next and be like Hassan doesn't know black liberation. George Floyd actually [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=425.26s)]
*  was a drug addict. Do you have a response? See Candace Owens is a black woman. She knows [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=431.78000000000003s)]
*  what's going on. Is that what you're going to tell me next? I don't give up this guy [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=437.97999999999996s)]
*  and you for thinking this guy's word matters. Anything anyone that is an Arab, non Jewish [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=441.38s)]
*  Arab living in Israel, living inside of the borders of Israel that defends Israel this [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=449.78s)]
*  hard is literally begging to be spat on every day of the week. Okay. That's what this guy's [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=454.47999999999996s)]
*  position is. It's got to be like a, like a sexual kink for this person to just constantly [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=460.67999999999995s)]
*  get spat on by the settler population when he's walking down the streets. I don't give [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=466.2s)]
*  up what he has to say. Look at his bio. That should be enough for you to be like, I will [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=471.76s)]
*  never listen to you. He's a Nazi. Yeah. His Christian dad fought the PLO. Hmm. Wonder [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=475.32s)]
*  what that means. Anyway, let's hear what this, uh, let's see what the statement was. Let [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=481.08s)]
*  me give a reminder to the other side, the American side, which is negotiating indirectly. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=485.46s)]
*  Should try to try not to talk nonsense. To say that we will not allow Iran to enrich [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=496.56s)]
*  uranium is a huge mistake. No one is waiting for permission from anyone. The Islamic Republic [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=505.68s)]
*  has its own policies, its own methods, and it pursues its own agenda. Man, the Ayatollah [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=518.04s)]
*  is whack. Let me be real. Hassan is a kink for degrading his chatters. What dude, like [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=526.32s)]
*  a week off. I always feel bad for Iranian leaders because they want to do their thing, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=532.32s)]
*  but they can't cause the Ayatollah doesn't let them. Yeah, I, I understand that, but [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=535.9200000000001s)]
*  in this process, it doesn't even matter. Okay. If we're talking about America versus, uh, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=541.08s)]
*  versus Iran in the region, like obviously, obviously that's completely irrelevant. The [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=545.88s)]
*  thing is like, that's the biggest L for Iran, uh, is, is like how fundamentalist this leadership [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=553.52s)]
*  is still, and it's directly a byproduct of just fundamentalism being associated with [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=560.52s)]
*  anti-Western imperialism. It's the most honest, uh, way of, of being anti-West. Okay. That's [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=565.72s)]
*  what the revolution was about initially. And it sucks because Iran is an incredibly diverse [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=574.0s)]
*  nation. Iran is a beautiful nation and Iran should not be under such a fundamentalist [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=580.52s)]
*  rule all things considered. And Iran wasn't under such a fundamentalist rule. And no, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=587.84s)]
*  I'm not talking about the Shah era either. Okay. Like that is obviously another, uh, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=592.48s)]
*  reason that is the primary reason Western intervention is the primary reason for why [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=599.6s)]
*  Iran is so goddamn fundamentalist in his governance. But ultimately if we're talking about state [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=604.0799999999999s)]
*  versus state violence here, like obviously Iran is going to defend itself, forcing its [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=610.28s)]
*  hand into, uh, engaging in violent retaliation is idiotic. I don't know. We'll see. They [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=617.36s)]
*  are an incredibly restrained party here though, in comparison to Israel. It's not even a fucking [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=624.36s)]
*  question. In comparison to the United States of America and its extension Israel, Iran [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=629.8399999999999s)]
*  is the far more restrained party. Okay. Just like Hamas is the far more restrained, far [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=635.5600000000001s)]
*  more diplomatic party in comparison to Israel, in comparison to the United States of America. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=643.48s)]
*  And uh, that's it, dude. The funniest thing is this like, uh, the weird pedophile lolly [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=649.8000000000001s)]
*  YouTube guy has like eight fans, but they don't stop being fucking annoying. Like they [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=655.5600000000001s)]
*  will still be like, Hey, why are you guys? Why are you not talking about this guy? I [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=661.72s)]
*  don't know. Maybe because he's fucking utterly irrelevant, dude. What the fuck? Like I was [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=666.4s)]
*  watching a speech that I delivered at Oxford union and these guys who are volunteering [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=672.4s)]
*  this information that you wouldn't be able to get out of me in a fucking CIA black site [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZdJJbfS5UQ&t=677.9s)]
