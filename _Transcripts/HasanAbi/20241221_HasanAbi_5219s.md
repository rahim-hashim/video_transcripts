# Shopping For Christmas Decorations Together With Valkyrae And QTCinderella
**HasanAbi:** [December 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw)
*  I don't like the one with the groom's sweater. I don't like that. Why is he wearing a sweater? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=0.0s)]
*  What are you a human? Get out of here. Dogs are not supposed to be wearing sweaters like that. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=17.52s)]
*  All right, it's picking back up. It's picking back up. It is. Yeah, it's like three bands. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=30.0s)]
*  Yeah. Or not three bands, 30 bands. Jesus Christ. Yeah. Well, it's expensive, but it's also, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=42.88s)]
*  one, how push-streamers do their job, and two, it's basically... He loves the news van reference. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=56.24s)]
*  Yeah. And he's going to say it's like the news van, but like in a bad way. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=63.760000000000005s)]
*  Why are you... Bro, I've heard this reference maybe 60 times. And we love the news van reference. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=67.76s)]
*  It's funny because I use the news van reference at work all the time. Yeah. The reason why... What [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=74.8s)]
*  the is happening right now, dude? What is going on with my god damn it? I'm so happy I have [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=80.72s)]
*  nothing to do with this camera setup. No, it's... Dude. I just... Okay, here, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=88.48s)]
*  Marsh and I will do the news van reference. Yeah, it's like a news van, but like it's cheap. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=96.72s)]
*  And you know, it's in a backpack. Back in the day, they used to have news vans, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=103.44s)]
*  and they still kind of do. But back in the day, they had it also. Okay? These news vans have these [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=109.44s)]
*  big ass satellites on them. Okay? And they're very expensive. Like a million dollars. And now, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=114.32s)]
*  basically, the same exact thing that that news van does, which is like being able to live broadcast, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=120.72s)]
*  can be done. Whoa! A f***ing stork. What is that? It's a stork. Did I say it right? Is it a stork? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=125.68s)]
*  Someone just had a baby. I don't know. I didn't see it. Oh, that was so sick. I've never seen a [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=133.76s)]
*  flying stork before. I don't think I've seen a stork either. That was... You were... Well, you [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=138.4s)]
*  could have seen it if you were paying attention. I was looking at my phone like an idiot. Oh my God. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=143.84s)]
*  Like a f***ing idiot. Who would have thought a stork would fly by at that moment? That was so sick. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  Okay, anyway, getting back to the point I was making. I tried to flip it in time, chat. I'm [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=154.64000000000001s)]
*  sorry that you guys couldn't see the stork. He was so delayed by the way. Okay. Like I saw the tail of [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  the stork before it left in the camera. Anyway. He was f***ing in real life. Anyways, I was saying [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=165.36s)]
*  back in the day, they had these news vans. Now with the modern technology, you could basically [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=172.08s)]
*  have that in your backpack. Not only that, but the new backpacks, as a matter of fact, that they have [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=177.60000000000002s)]
*  out now have six modems and they're even better in terms of quality, in terms of what kind of [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=181.36s)]
*  footage you can get. And also they basically never f***, which is why I'm very excited. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=187.52s)]
*  Will we have it in time for Japan? Yes, it's coming in the upcoming week. So I'm gonna test it out here. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=193.84s)]
*  It's the... The new one's a satchel. It's the long one. It's the one that looks like a camelback. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=202.64s)]
*  What are you doing with this one? I don't know. I mean I'll still have this. The problem is like... [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=208.79999999999998s)]
*  Is there a problem? Yeah. What's the problem? There is a problem. The problem is... So you have three [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=219.12s)]
*  backpacks. What's the problem? The backpack on its own is nothing because you still need to have a [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=223.52s)]
*  cloud server and you still need to make sure that the modems are being paid for. You think she's... [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=233.28s)]
*  Well, I was gonna say that should be included in the gift, right? Like I think... Oh. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=242.07999999999998s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Subscription gift. Because I'm gonna continue to have birthdays so I feel like [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=246.48000000000002s)]
*  he could continue to... You're just gonna go on a subscription model? So wait, I don't understand. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=251.6s)]
*  So I'm just... It's a good idea. So that's it? This is the one time... You gotta smash that subscribe [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=256.32s)]
*  button, Hasan. This is the one birthday? No. I want more gifts. There's Christmas. Yeah, there's [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=260.8s)]
*  Thanksgiving. I'm a Christmas girlie now so I'm expecting lots of gifts this year. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=268.72s)]
*  You're gonna get coal. Yeah. You know what I'm getting? Myeong for Christmas. What? I already [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=275.84000000000003s)]
*  spoiled it. No, I had to spoil it already because I wanted her to pick the right one. I'm gonna get [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=281.6s)]
*  her one of those like OG Pokemon boxes because she likes to open Pokemon. Oh my god, that's so nice. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=285.68s)]
*  Yeah. The Gamba. She does love Pokemon. She loves Pokemon cards. But I was looking at them and [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=291.6s)]
*  they just don't... They have like two cool cards in each box and you can't get them all in one box. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=301.52s)]
*  People are saying is this Porsche? The answer is yes. We are in the legendary Porsche with the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=307.92s)]
*  Alcantara. Yeah. Right? Isn't this Alcantara? Wow, I feel like Doug DiMiro. Call me Doug the [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=316.8s)]
*  way I'm noticing Alcantara. Can you hold the camera more still? You're making me dizzy. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=322.96s)]
*  It's very difficult. You're in a car. That's why they pay him the big bucks. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=328.0s)]
*  See, look at Marisco. You wouldn't do that. Oh, I'm watching. Oh, the back is stripped. The cables [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=336.15999999999997s)]
*  are hanging. They've noticed your cables. Yeah, I removed the interior panels when I was doing the [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=342.23999999999995s)]
*  Baja rallies. What's a Baja rally? So I do like an amateur rally from LA to Cabo and back like over [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=346.64s)]
*  the course of 10 days. Like a race? Yes. Well, kind of. It's not like a time race. It's like a [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=354.8s)]
*  marathon. Yeah, but there's like objectives. You have to like go hit a bunch of GPS points. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=362.0s)]
*  Oh. Yeah. What if you cheat and you fly to the... You have a receiver on your car that pings every [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=366.40000000000003s)]
*  five seconds or something and they track your speed and your location and the time and then [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=373.28000000000003s)]
*  they'll give you like a sheet every morning. What if you go over the speed limit? They deduct points. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=378.96000000000004s)]
*  Wait, really? Depends. I mean, like they're pretty relaxed about it. But if like, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=384.24s)]
*  if local communities start complaining, then they'll hit you with some penalties. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=391.68s)]
*  But yeah, so they'll give you like a sheet and then they'll like spray paint like a number in [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=399.92s)]
*  the back of a cactus in the middle of nowhere. They'll give you the coordinates to have to like [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=404.40000000000003s)]
*  go find that number. And then like the next day that number will be a part of the coordinates. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=407.6s)]
*  So like without getting the first day, you can't do the second day. Stuff like that. It's not really... [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=412.24s)]
*  Adventure rally. That guy had three dogs and a poop bag in his hand and his one dog wasn't paying [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=424.0s)]
*  attention. He hit his dog in the head with a poop bag. Nice. That'll teach him. That was not nice. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=429.68s)]
*  Anyway, yeah, I removed a lot of parts from this car for that. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=434.32s)]
*  And some of the stuff doesn't need to go back in. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=437.44s)]
*  And you might have noticed that we're lifted. That was, what was that? Is that my birthday gift? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=443.92s)]
*  No, that was last year's. Oh, yeah. Last Christmas. Five inch lift with two and a half inch coil overs. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=449.52s)]
*  I gave you my heart and the very next day you gave it away. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=456.16s)]
*  Basically never F's by the way. Wait, is it, is it F-ing right now? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=462.24s)]
*  It's been many F's. Oh, this backpack is not the one that never F's. This backpack still [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=466.48s)]
*  very much F's, unfortunately. So give this one to her and then call it good. That's what, yeah, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=472.96000000000004s)]
*  that's what I would do. But the problem is she would need her own cloud server because I think [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=479.6s)]
*  they're probably going to substitute my new backpack to the cloud server. That sounds like [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=484.64s)]
*  a Marsh problem. No, this is not something Marsh can do. I'm joking. I don't want this one. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=488.88s)]
*  This one has f-ing. She can buy the nice one. Oh, I like that. Oh, yeah? Yeah, I want the new one. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=495.2s)]
*  Can I borrow it in Japan? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Wait, import. No. Hot way. That's crazy. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=502.96s)]
*  No, he never lets anyone else stream. That's literally not true. I have Will's and. Last time [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=515.6s)]
*  you let Will stream once. No, I have, I have, I have Will's, I have Will's information in this. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=522.88s)]
*  It's just that he needs to re-log in and we couldn't do it last time when we went to the [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=529.76s)]
*  gym together. So we had to stream from his phone. Are you excited for more otters? Yeah, I want [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=532.8s)]
*  more presents. Yeah, we want presents. Yeah, I want presents. Why would I reveal that? For fun. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=540.0s)]
*  I'm not going to reveal it. Murat, what do you want for Christmas? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=548.32s)]
*  I know what you can get him. Yeah. Wait, what are you going to say? I know what he wants for [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=553.84s)]
*  Christmas. We could probably get something from Home Depot. Sick. No, he doesn't want something [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=558.48s)]
*  from Home Depot. How do you know? Actually, that's not true. He loves Home Depot. No, it's what I got. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=563.6s)]
*  I love Home Depot and I love those and I most certainly love Harbor Freight. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=567.44s)]
*  Yeah, Harbor Freight is a s***. He wants engineer toys, says Chad. That's true. You want a sports car? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=571.0400000000001s)]
*  Um, no, no, not a sports car. He wants an SUV. Oh, I have an SUV. But he wants an SUV. You want a bigger, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=582.8000000000001s)]
*  badder, stronger, thicker sports car? I mean, that sounds pretty sick. I'm going to keep it real. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=591.76s)]
*  Yeah, you want a sports car? A bigger, badder, stronger? You don't want a reasonable hybrid SUV? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=598.24s)]
*  I mean, that also sounds pretty responsible and great. Yeah, that's crazy that now you're [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=606.32s)]
*  all of a sudden you're acting different. What would you do to a cyber truck? Would you take [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=609.92s)]
*  apart, put back together? Ew. No, I mean, cyber trucks are kind of cool, but they're really not. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=615.36s)]
*  Boom, Marat, boom. I want to like it so bad, but it's so ugly. It sucks. I think it's also ugly. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=621.2s)]
*  This is the problem with STEM, by the way. No matter what happens, like, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=631.92s)]
*  they just eat up whatever Elon's doing regardless of their disagreements. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=636.48s)]
*  Rare, Marat. L, you're losing the chat with your cyber truck take. I said it's ugly. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=645.12s)]
*  I said I want to like it, but I don't. W, Marat. You talking about chat spawn? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=650.48s)]
*  Oh, that took me so long to get. No, the things that you would do to a cyber truck don't make [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=658.16s)]
*  sense because then you like ruin the range and also the chassis is not very strong. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=663.92s)]
*  It's not. You saw that Whistling Dixie video? Whistling Dixie or Whistling Diesel and we watch [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=669.28s)]
*  it together. Do Whistling Diesel. My bad. Are we there yet? So far. We should do a road trip stream. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=675.44s)]
*  Oh, you guys want to come to Baja with me? Baja. 10 days of hardcore off-roading. If we get a [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=686.4000000000001s)]
*  Baja blast every day. Would you actually do a road trip? Like really? Yeah. You want to go to Austin? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=691.44s)]
*  Weren't you guys planning on going up to the north? I would go to Austin. What? Yeah, but not a road [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=696.24s)]
*  trip. You remember a couple years ago? QT doesn't like to fly. I can't believe you'd be so. But she [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=701.28s)]
*  does now. It's the thing that she does. She does fly now. She's already on the frequent [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=706.48s)]
*  flyer program. She's got, she's joined the million dollar club. I'm actually in shock that you like. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=710.4s)]
*  QT actually flew here. It wasn't even Taylor Swift's pattern. She put ass Maya starting to pack my bag [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=715.52s)]
*  and I was like. Oh, so that's all you have to do is just. Just peer pressure? Yeah. And it wasn't [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=720.9599999999999s)]

*  I like the fat one. I mean, this one's really sad. Yeah, that one's kind of sad too. Yeah, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=920.8000000000001s)]

*  potentially buy the ugly ones. You're going to kill it in like a week. You're going to throw it out. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=935.36s)]

*  Streamer leaves home. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1528.4s)]
*  It's just so...it reminds me of the last time I went to Costco. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1530.4s)]
*  It was very big. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1532.4s)]
*  What about that guy up there? [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1534.4s)]
*  I don't like that it's mouth is full. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1536.4s)]
*  That is kind of creepy. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1538.4s)]
*  I want to think about this. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1540.4s)]
*  Wait, why not? [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1542.4s)]
*  How are we going to fit that in the car? [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1544.4s)]
*  Do you remember what happened to... [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1546.4s)]
*  ethnic Santa? [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1548.4s)]
*  He was around for like three years. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1550.4s)]
*  This is the most used Santa of all time. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1552.4s)]
*  Yeah, but then he abandoned him. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1554.4s)]
*  He sold him at an auction. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1556.4s)]
*  I gave him away for a good reason. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1558.4s)]
*  What's a cinnamon broom? [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1560.4s)]
*  It smells really good. You put it by your front door [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1562.4s)]
*  and then your whole house will smell like it. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1564.4s)]
*  What the? [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1566.4s)]
*  Yo, the Christmas tree has got this shit on lock, dude. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1568.4s)]
*  It's going to be so hot. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1576.4s)]
*  I'm wrapping my head around it. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1578.4s)]
*  Listen, this is not my best work. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1580.4s)]
*  And you're a Grinch, so that makes sense. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1582.4s)]
*  I just really need a Michael's [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1584.4s)]
*  or a Joe Anks. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1586.4s)]
*  They killed him. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1588.4s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1590.4s)]
*  Someone wanted to buy... [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1592.4s)]
*  He was just enjoying his meal. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1594.4s)]
*  Is there a joke in there somewhere? [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1596.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's the Christmas rat. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1598.4s)]
*  It's scabbing. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1600.4s)]
*  Mom is watching the stream. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1602.4s)]
*  She said get more of those little trees [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1604.4s)]
*  for the dining table. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1606.4s)]
*  Oh, that's a cute idea. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1608.4s)]
*  Mom watching to tell him what to get. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1610.4s)]
*  Do you like the... [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1620.4s)]
*  I feel like it's unsettling [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1622.4s)]
*  that he doesn't have a face. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1624.4s)]
*  I don't like that. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1626.4s)]
*  This gingerbread is cute. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1628.4s)]
*  It's not as cute. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1630.4s)]
*  Wait, what about... [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1632.4s)]
*  These are more aesthetic. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1634.4s)]
*  Well, it's got snow on it. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1636.4s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. These are better. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1638.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1640.4s)]
*  But there's only two of them. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1642.4s)]
*  She probably wants three. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1644.4s)]
*  Two is fine. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1646.4s)]
*  Two is fine. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1648.4s)]
*  That one's cute. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1650.4s)]
*  Two is a good amount. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1652.4s)]
*  I like those. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1662.4s)]
*  Alright, let's see what else Mom. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1664.4s)]
*  She said yes, get that two. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1666.4s)]
*  Oh, you want the third one too, Mom? [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1668.4s)]
*  Hey Mom, would you like more of the dogs [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1670.4s)]
*  by chance? [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1672.4s)]
*  Okay, she's done with the dog. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1674.4s)]
*  I think she's good with the dog. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1676.4s)]
*  Well, then you leave the other one, right? [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1678.4s)]
*  You can't... [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1680.4s)]
*  Then that's it. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1682.4s)]
*  No. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1684.4s)]
*  Okay, respectfully... [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1686.4s)]
*  He's an ape. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1688.4s)]
*  ...triggers me that the headphones are over the ears. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1690.4s)]
*  He can't hear anything. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1692.4s)]
*  Like, this dog [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1694.4s)]
*  is not listening to shit. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1696.4s)]
*  Okay, I'm gonna get this dog then. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1698.4s)]
*  Yes! Yes, yes, yes. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1700.4s)]
*  I like this one. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1702.4s)]
*  I don't like the one with the groomed sweater. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1704.4s)]
*  I don't like it. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1706.4s)]
*  I don't like that dog. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1708.4s)]
*  Why is he wearing a sweater? What are you, a human? [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1710.4s)]
*  Get out of here. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1712.4s)]
*  Dogs are not supposed to be wearing sweaters like that. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1714.4s)]
*  No, I'm not getting him. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1716.4s)]
*  I'm putting my foot down. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1718.4s)]
*  What is Kaio gonna do when she sees these dogs? [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1720.4s)]
*  She's gonna get scared of them. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1722.4s)]
*  She might just run into it. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1724.4s)]
*  She's like, ahhh. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1726.4s)]
*  He's gonna fix it. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1728.4s)]
*  They have partners now. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1730.4s)]
*  I don't think they have any. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1732.4s)]
*  All these are parts of it. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1734.4s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1738.4s)]
*  They're opening this area. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1740.4s)]
*  So we can get the... [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1742.4s)]
*  I really want Nutcracker guys. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1744.4s)]
*  I don't know why. I just think they're sick. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1746.4s)]
*  You can't say the C word. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1748.4s)]
*  I can. Wait, we didn't get any of those? [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1750.4s)]
*  No, because they were... [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1752.4s)]
*  It was blocked. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1754.4s)]
*  Mom said, what if Kaio gets jealous? [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1756.4s)]
*  Oh, those are the Nutcrackers you want. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1758.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1760.4s)]
*  Yeah, my bad. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1762.4s)]
*  They're sick. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1764.4s)]
*  Look at them. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1766.4s)]
*  Okay, hear me out. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1768.4s)]
*  What about the little angel? [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1770.4s)]
*  What about the angel? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1772.4s)]
*  So ugly. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1774.4s)]
*  You don't like this guy? [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1776.4s)]
*  Do you put that on... [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1780.4s)]
*  No, that's inflatable. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1782.4s)]
*  It's a three foot tall angel? [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1784.4s)]
*  Oh my god, this one's sad. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1786.4s)]
*  Why would anybody want a sad one? [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1790.4s)]
*  I want these. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1792.4s)]
*  Oh. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1796.4s)]
*  Wait, this is a three feet? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1798.4s)]
*  No, it's the same. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1800.4s)]
*  It's three feet. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1802.4s)]
*  It's a unit of one. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1804.4s)]
*  Thanks, man. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1806.4s)]
*  I'm kind of worried about the phone. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1808.4s)]
*  We have trunk space, but not that much. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1810.4s)]
*  I think we'll fit. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1814.4s)]
*  I think we can go in our laps. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1816.4s)]
*  I'm just carrying him. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1818.4s)]
*  We need hooks for the ornaments, but they don't have any. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1820.4s)]
*  Do you have paper clips at your house by chance? [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1822.4s)]
*  No. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1824.4s)]
*  I mean, these are the only ones, the wreath hooks. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1826.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's not what we want. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1828.4s)]
*  We just have one. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1830.4s)]
*  Put it in a bag. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1832.4s)]
*  It's not a good idea. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1834.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1836.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1838.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1840.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1842.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1844.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1846.4s)]
*  Put it in a bag. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1848.4s)]
*  It's fine. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1850.4s)]
*  Okay, never mind. We don't want it. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1852.4s)]
*  Oh, we need this, right? [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1854.4s)]
*  We put this on the door, right? [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1856.4s)]
*  Yeah, but then you need a hook set. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1858.4s)]
*  Well, they have the hook set. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1860.4s)]
*  What about these? [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1862.4s)]
*  Gutter hooks? [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1864.4s)]
*  Oh, no, they're for gutters. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1866.4s)]
*  I think that's a good idea. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1868.4s)]
*  Put that on the door. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1870.4s)]
*  Mine's thinking alike. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1872.4s)]
*  Again, wow. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1874.4s)]
*  Rollers. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1876.4s)]
*  Wait, don't we need to pick a tree now? [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1884.4s)]
*  I'm a little worried about [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1886.4s)]
*  not being able to [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1888.4s)]
*  put everything in the car now. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1890.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's what we need. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1892.4s)]
*  We could buy those boxes. Yeah, I can put stuff on them. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1894.4s)]
*  I think we'll fit it. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1896.4s)]
*  I think so. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1898.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1902.4s)]
*  Yeah, one for every person in the backseat. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1904.4s)]
*  Well, you're driving. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1906.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1908.4s)]
*  Dog free. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1910.4s)]
*  I want to look at the rest of the store. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1912.4s)]
*  Are there any ribbons here? [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1914.4s)]
*  Yeah, ribbons. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1916.4s)]
*  Home Depot, scrolling. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1918.4s)]
*  Mom had a good idea. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1920.4s)]
*  Get extension cords for the lights. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1922.4s)]
*  Oh, there's the back room. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1924.4s)]
*  Paint. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1926.4s)]
*  I should paint your tree. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1928.4s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1930.4s)]
*  Yeah, no, I think we shouldn't do that. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1932.4s)]
*  They have a lot of colors. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1934.4s)]
*  I think we should not do that. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1936.4s)]
*  What about a new couch? [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1938.4s)]
*  How are you? [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1940.4s)]
*  It's only $300. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1942.4s)]
*  That's an affordable couch. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1944.4s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1946.4s)]
*  Let's not do that. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1948.4s)]
*  There's extension cords there. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1956.4s)]
*  No, that's not it. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1958.4s)]
*  Alright, let's just go back and grab it I guess. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1962.4s)]
*  Doesn't the inflatable constantly make noise, Mara? [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1988.4s)]
*  Probably. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1992.4s)]
*  So we can't put it in the stream room. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1994.4s)]
*  No, we got all these dogs. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1996.4s)]
*  All three of them. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=1998.4s)]
*  We have to surround Kaya's bed with it? [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2000.4s)]
*  Yeah, they're singing Christmas carols to her. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2002.4s)]
*  She loves it. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2004.4s)]
*  What's in that first bench? [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2006.4s)]
*  Oh, yeah, right here. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2014.4s)]
*  Yeah, right here. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2016.4s)]
*  Oh, also right here. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2018.4s)]
*  Also everywhere. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2020.4s)]
*  What do we need? [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2022.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2024.4s)]
*  They sell rocks. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2026.4s)]
*  Probably, honestly. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2028.4s)]
*  Not the kind that you like. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2030.4s)]
*  Not like you need rocks. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2032.4s)]
*  What about pet stuff? [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2034.4s)]
*  Do they sell pet stuff here? [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2036.4s)]
*  Probably. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2038.4s)]
*  Imagine being a Valkyrie fan and you just see her walking through her own depot by herself with a dog in her shopping cart. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2046.4s)]
*  If we don't stop her, she's going to go and purchase paint. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2062.4s)]
*  Look at all this glue! [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2066.4s)]
*  I've never seen so much glue in my life! [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2070.4s)]
*  Have you ever seen a whole new house? [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2074.4s)]
*  I don't think she has. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2078.4s)]
*  It's been like 15 years. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2080.4s)]
*  I don't think she has ever been to a house like that. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2082.4s)]
*  This is like glue glue. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2084.4s)]
*  I don't know, but you need some of this stuff. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2086.4s)]
*  Did you get any extension cords? [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2088.4s)]
*  No. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2090.4s)]
*  Wait, you got some, didn't you? [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2092.4s)]
*  No, you grabbed some, so I thought you grabbed some. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2094.4s)]
*  Alright, I grabbed some. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2096.4s)]
*  I'm going to grab two more because I kind of thought you got one. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2098.4s)]
*  It feels like a fever dream. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2100.4s)]
*  Marat, what's your favorite aisle? [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2102.4s)]
*  Oh, I like the Power Tools, obviously. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2104.4s)]
*  We can go look at it. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2106.4s)]
*  We need to do the autism test for you. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2108.4s)]
*  I'm not autistic. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2110.4s)]
*  I just like textures and I think rocks have really good texture. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2112.4s)]
*  They have textures right there behind you. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2116.4s)]
*  This? [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2118.4s)]
*  No, these are textures. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2120.4s)]
*  Putty? [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2122.4s)]
*  Oh. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2124.4s)]
*  Wall texture. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2126.4s)]
*  You literally said you like texture. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2128.4s)]
*  Oh, we got a popcorn ceiling patch. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2130.4s)]
*  A landlord's favorite. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2134.4s)]
*  What is the popcorn for? [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2136.4s)]
*  It's easy to mask imperfections when you have popcorn ceiling. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2138.4s)]
*  You know, every time I go to a hotel, you look at the carpet because it's made to hide imperfections. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2142.4s)]
*  So is the bathrooms at Disneyland. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2150.4s)]
*  That's why the tile is number one plain. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2152.4s)]
*  It's all these different mosaic tiles because then it hides spells. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2154.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2156.4s)]
*  You want a poly back canvas drop cloth, Rachel? [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2158.4s)]
*  No, but I do need some blue tape. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2166.4s)]
*  Oh, you can never have enough. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2168.4s)]
*  Cinema. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2182.4s)]
*  The Rock has virtually everything here. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2186.4s)]
*  And I only know it. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2192.4s)]
*  The only reason why I know it is because it's always around my house. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2194.4s)]
*  Wait, so are we still getting like a tree tree? [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2208.4s)]
*  Yeah, outside. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2210.4s)]
*  I'm gonna get one baby tree and one big tree. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2212.4s)]
*  Well, I guess we have a baby tree. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2214.4s)]
*  Do they have a sugar free Mountain Dew Co. Red? [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2228.4s)]
*  No. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2230.4s)]
*  Damn it. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2234.4s)]
*  I need a little treat, you know, after all this work. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2240.4s)]
*  I'll be over here. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2244.4s)]
*  I don't want to spam or show anybody's credit cards. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2250.4s)]
*  You guys want to pretend like we're checking out? [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2252.4s)]
*  Look, it's me, Chad. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2254.4s)]
*  Hi. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2256.4s)]
*  We got so much stuff. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2258.4s)]
*  Actually, this will be good content. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2260.4s)]
*  We're recording in progress. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2262.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2264.4s)]
*  Are we supposed to get the trees in there? [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2266.4s)]
*  Are we supposed to get the trees in there? [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2268.4s)]
*  Alan, scan. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2270.4s)]
*  Please, we scanned the last time. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2272.4s)]
*  That's a bad start. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2274.4s)]
*  Where do I put it? Do I put it here? [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2278.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2280.4s)]
*  It's not gonna fit. We got too much stuff. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2282.4s)]
*  I know. We just need another cart. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2284.4s)]
*  And then... [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2286.4s)]
*  I'll do that. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2288.4s)]
*  And you stack it into this cart. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2298.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2300.4s)]
*  Here, I'll move half of it. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2306.4s)]
*  It's like grocery store simulator. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2308.4s)]
*  Wow. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2310.4s)]
*  Teamwork. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2324.4s)]
*  Here, keep it. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2328.4s)]
*  What is that for, Maron? [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2330.4s)]
*  He bought it. He wanted it. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2332.4s)]
*  He wanted it. We got it. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2334.4s)]
*  You want it. I got it. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2336.4s)]
*  Go get it. I bought it. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2338.4s)]
*  I stole your cousin. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2340.4s)]
*  It was crazy. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2342.4s)]
*  I actually like this, by the way. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2344.4s)]
*  I actually like this, by the way. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2346.4s)]
*  I wonder what so many Jesus candles are. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2362.4s)]
*  I don't know, cause Jesus [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2364.4s)]
*  is my light, [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2366.4s)]
*  my lord, my savior. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2368.4s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2370.4s)]
*  What do you have a problem with, Jesus? [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2372.4s)]
*  I don't know him like this. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2374.4s)]
*  What? I'm sorry. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2376.4s)]
*  It's a lot of Jesus candles. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2378.4s)]
*  Do you hate Jesus Christ our lord and savior and the saints? [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2380.4s)]
*  I don't hate him. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2382.4s)]
*  Seems like you do. I just don't know him. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2384.4s)]
*  It's a little parasocial if you'd have candles with his face on it. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2386.4s)]
*  I want Luigi Mangione candles, [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2388.4s)]
*  but they don't have them here, so... [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2390.4s)]
*  I'm sure they're available on Amazon. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2392.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2396.4s)]
*  How do we skin this inflatable good-time? [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2398.4s)]
*  Uh... [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2400.4s)]
*  It probably did come in a box. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2402.4s)]
*  It probably did come in a box. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2404.4s)]
*  You guys just steal an inflatable? [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2406.4s)]

*  Is there a problem? [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2580.4s)]
*  Yeah, they're telling us we can't bring the dogs. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2582.4s)]
*  Why? [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2584.4s)]
*  I'm still... [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2586.4s)]
*  That would've been crazy if they tried me. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2588.4s)]
*  Dogs! [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2590.4s)]
*  It lights up! [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2592.4s)]
*  So, do I get the car now or do we go buy trees and then get the car? [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2594.4s)]
*  Can I take it away? [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2598.4s)]
*  What's the tree behind the car? [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2600.4s)]
*  Baby. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2602.4s)]
*  You take a tree, they wrap it up for you, you stick it on top of your car, you strap it down. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2604.4s)]
*  Okay, so we get the trees first. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2606.4s)]
*  Beep, beep. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2608.4s)]
*  Boom. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2612.4s)]
*  Alright, the final piece. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2614.4s)]
*  It's just these guys. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2616.4s)]
*  The final piece. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2618.4s)]
*  Once we have... [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2620.4s)]
*  You got the fucking ugly dog tree? [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2622.4s)]
*  What? That's crazy. Look at that. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2624.4s)]
*  I told you not to get that. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2626.4s)]
*  What? [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2628.4s)]
*  Is that your mountain dude? [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2630.4s)]
*  Yeah, I already scanned it. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2632.4s)]
*  Bro, can we buy some center blocks? [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2634.4s)]
*  I could really use some center blocks. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2636.4s)]
*  I don't know about coal, but I do want some center blocks for Christmas. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2638.4s)]
*  I'll do some center blocks for Christmas. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2642.4s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2644.4s)]
*  Phew. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2650.4s)]
*  Didn't let the frog get away with anything. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2652.4s)]
*  So there's like zero chances of this in the car, right? [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2658.4s)]
*  No, it's gonna fit. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2660.4s)]
*  No, we can make it fit, but we do need boxes like storage. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2662.4s)]
*  You think so? [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2664.4s)]
*  I think it'll be fine. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2666.4s)]
*  I'll just come back later. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2668.4s)]
*  Alright. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2670.4s)]
*  Alright, no more filming this part. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2672.4s)]
*  What is the total? [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2674.4s)]
*  $580. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2676.4s)]
*  Sorry guys. Dad said no more filming today. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2678.4s)]
*  Dad says you're not allowed to come out and play today. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2682.4s)]
*  Sorry guys. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2684.4s)]
*  I saw a comment. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2700.4s)]
*  I'm reading you right now, Chevy. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2702.4s)]
*  I saw a comment. Hold on. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2704.4s)]
*  March makes me feel safe. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2706.4s)]
*  That's cute. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2708.4s)]
*  That's an ugly dog. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2712.4s)]
*  Here, let's just take all the stuff into the [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2726.4s)]
*  tree area with us and then we'll do all the rest of the truck. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2728.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2730.4s)]
*  I can't even hear myself. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2754.4s)]
*  Alright, I'm trying to get out. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2756.4s)]
*  I hate it. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2760.4s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2762.4s)]
*  Yeah, you guys don't like loud noises? [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2764.4s)]
*  No. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2766.4s)]
*  They overwhelm me. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2768.4s)]
*  So we came for all the stuff already. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2774.4s)]
*  Once we get the trees, we're gonna bring the car and then just figure it out. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2776.4s)]
*  Do you want us to park it in the corner over there somewhere? [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2780.4s)]
*  The carts? [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2784.4s)]
*  Yeah, with all the stuff that we already have. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2786.4s)]
*  Hope someone steals that. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2798.4s)]
*  Her name? [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2804.4s)]
*  Oh, you know who she is? [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2806.4s)]
*  Pokimane? [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2808.4s)]
*  Yeah, there you go. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2810.4s)]
*  Hello, we need... [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2812.4s)]
*  That's me. Nice to meet you. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2814.4s)]
*  I'm wannabe. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2816.4s)]
*  So we've never bought a tree before. How does this work? [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2818.4s)]
*  Do we need a position? [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2820.4s)]
*  No, so you go over here, select the tree that you want. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2822.4s)]
*  I saw that one. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2824.4s)]
*  Aww. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2826.4s)]
*  He's just a little guy. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2828.4s)]
*  He's just a guy. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2830.4s)]
*  And then do we need one of these? [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2832.4s)]
*  Yeah, it depends on the tree that you get. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2834.4s)]
*  We only have 8 foot. I think 8 and 10 and 12. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2836.4s)]
*  So if you get one that's like 7 feet... [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2838.4s)]
*  I mean, you gotta. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2840.4s)]
*  Nice! [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2842.4s)]
*  Yeah, so there's like really small... [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2844.4s)]
*  Me when I'm nice. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2846.4s)]
*  Oh, you just don't have a 6 foot? [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2848.4s)]
*  Yeah, we don't have a 6 foot. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2850.4s)]
*  You have it. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2852.4s)]
*  Wait, you have it for 8 feet? [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2854.4s)]
*  Yes, we have it for 8 foot. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2856.4s)]
*  I guess you're getting an 8 foot tree. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2858.4s)]
*  Alright, we'll do the 8 feet one. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2860.4s)]
*  Oh, hell yeah. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2862.4s)]
*  It looks like it. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2864.4s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2866.4s)]
*  Damn, those are some big fucking trees. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2868.4s)]
*  I mean, it's probably longer than 5 feet, isn't it? [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2870.4s)]
*  Meet me. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2882.4s)]
*  What am I doing, stealing Christmas? [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2884.4s)]
*  Oh god, you scared me! [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2886.4s)]
*  I feel like I need a leash for you. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2896.4s)]
*  Why? I'm right here! [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2898.4s)]
*  You're like... [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2900.4s)]
*  Where do they sell the butts? [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2902.4s)]
*  The butts? [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2904.4s)]
*  Like the bases. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2906.4s)]
*  Oh, I missed the butts. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2908.4s)]
*  Wait, you want one for your apartment? [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2910.4s)]
*  Um, it has to be... [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2912.4s)]
*  I like... [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2914.4s)]
*  ...the reefs. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2916.4s)]
*  This one. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2918.4s)]
*  You know what my whole plan was with you, right? [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2926.4s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2928.4s)]
*  Marat had a sick plan that we never ended up doing. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2930.4s)]
*  He never told you? [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2932.4s)]
*  He wanted Fearan to go and cut a tree down. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2934.4s)]
*  He got a license. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2936.4s)]
*  I got special permits from the National Forest Service. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2938.4s)]
*  Why did you not tell us that? [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2940.4s)]
*  They're like impossible to get. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2942.4s)]
*  I called them a bunch of times. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2944.4s)]
*  I found out when it was coming. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2946.4s)]
*  It sold out in 3 minutes and I got a permit for you guys. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2948.4s)]
*  I think I actually [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2950.4s)]
*  brought it up in the group chat one time. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2952.4s)]
*  If we look back. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2954.4s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2956.4s)]
*  The problem is it's 3 hours away. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2958.4s)]
*  Oh yeah, what a problem. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2960.4s)]
*  Disneyland is too. I go there every day. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2962.4s)]
*  Oh my god, what if it's by Disney? [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2964.4s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2966.4s)]
*  What if it's by something else? [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2968.4s)]
*  It's by Paper School. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2970.4s)]
*  That would be great content though. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2972.4s)]
*  Cutting down a tree and then dying. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2974.4s)]
*  I think... [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2976.4s)]
*  Let's just get that big one out there in the front. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2978.4s)]
*  You want the big one? [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2980.4s)]
*  That's the one that caught his eye. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2982.4s)]
*  I want a big one and then I want a little one. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2984.4s)]
*  We need the little one for the stream room. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2986.4s)]
*  Who's your house? [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2988.4s)]
*  The 8 foot stands can even hold a 6 foot. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2990.4s)]
*  It's just up to 8 foot. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2994.4s)]
*  So I think you get a 6 foot for your stream room. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=2996.4s)]
*  So are these? [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3000.4s)]
*  I guess these are 6 to 7? [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3002.4s)]
*  Right here? [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3004.4s)]
*  That's a 4 for sure. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3006.4s)]
*  These are 6 feet. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3008.4s)]
*  That's a nice 6 right there. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3010.4s)]
*  That's a nice 6 right there. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3012.4s)]
*  Nice 6, yeah. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3014.4s)]
*  Not everyone is perfect. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3016.4s)]
*  But a lot of them have a bald spot. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3018.4s)]
*  That's why they're here. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3020.4s)]
*  They're all sold out. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3022.4s)]
*  Because all the good ones are sold out. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3024.4s)]
*  These are the left overs. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3026.4s)]
*  These are the ugly ones remaining. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3028.4s)]
*  They're still beautiful. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3030.4s)]
*  Do you think that these trees grow like this so that they have a lower chance of being cut down? [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3032.4s)]
*  What did you say? [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3036.4s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3038.4s)]
*  But they're all on a farm. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3040.4s)]
*  Genetically do this so they don't get chopped. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3042.4s)]
*  These all come from a nursery. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3044.4s)]
*  It's like a survival mechanism. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3046.4s)]
*  You can put a squirrel on it like it's living in it. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3048.4s)]
*  I like the gap. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3050.4s)]
*  I feel like you could put a gingerbread house here. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3052.4s)]
*  Yeah, a little someone's living there. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3054.4s)]
*  We could just cut the stems off. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3056.4s)]
*  Do you like the hole? [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3058.4s)]
*  That makes too much sense. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3060.4s)]
*  Do you like the gap? [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3062.4s)]
*  What time are we at? [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3064.4s)]
*  It is 4.32. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3066.4s)]
*  We gotta get a move on. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3068.4s)]
*  That's a good tree. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3070.4s)]
*  I gotta help with the decorating part. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3072.4s)]
*  What do you have after this? [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3078.4s)]
*  I really like this one. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3080.4s)]
*  Wait, is it a beer and a whole bunch of people laughing at us and I'm invited to? [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3082.4s)]
*  It's just an offline TV shoot. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3086.4s)]
*  I saw him pick a tree. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3088.4s)]
*  Trauma. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3090.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3092.4s)]
*  We have to hand carry every item into the house. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3094.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3098.4s)]
*  That's great. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3100.4s)]
*  I also don't like the smell. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3102.4s)]
*  This would be cute behind the tree. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3104.4s)]
*  I like this one. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3106.4s)]
*  This one is so bare. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3108.4s)]
*  It's cute. It's like giving peanuts. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3110.4s)]
*  This one. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3118.4s)]
*  What is fucked up? [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3120.4s)]
*  You like the fucked up one? [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3122.4s)]
*  You can put stuff in here. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3124.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3126.4s)]
*  What about this one? You can put a topper on. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3128.4s)]
*  I don't have a topper. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3130.4s)]
*  I don't make one out of paper. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3132.4s)]
*  Damn, what can't you do cutie? [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3136.4s)]
*  Okay, this part is harder than I thought. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3138.4s)]
*  I guess fly on airplanes. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3140.4s)]
*  At least we got the A-flutter up there that I'm gonna get. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3142.4s)]
*  What about these little ones? [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3146.4s)]
*  When your front one is good right here. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3152.4s)]
*  If this is your front, we fill it with ornaments and lights. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3158.4s)]
*  He's good. He's chilling. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3160.4s)]
*  Yeah, I'm into him. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3162.4s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3164.4s)]
*  This one is fine. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3166.4s)]
*  I think it's got too many extra twigs. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3168.4s)]
*  Why don't you guys pick your favorite ones and we'll just compare them by one. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3170.4s)]
*  Why don't we just let Chad decide? [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3178.4s)]
*  Okay, Chad can decide. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3180.4s)]
*  So, this is Ray's tree. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3182.4s)]
*  Do you like my tree? [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3184.4s)]
*  This is Tracey's Cinderella's tree. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3186.4s)]
*  I have no Pokemon. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3188.4s)]
*  That's Pokemon. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3192.4s)]
*  I have no dog in this flight, honestly. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3194.4s)]
*  So, we just decide between these two? [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3196.4s)]
*  Okay, Chad, vote. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3198.4s)]
*  Chad, vote. If you want this tree, put one in the chat. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3200.4s)]
*  Or no, let's put a poll up. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3204.4s)]
*  Let's put a poll up in the chat. Left or right tree? [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3206.4s)]
*  I'm not sure if you guys are going to vote anything. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3208.4s)]
*  Because all the extra twigs... [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3210.4s)]
*  Hey, don't campaign against this tree right now. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3212.4s)]
*  This one's sad. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3218.4s)]
*  Honestly. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3220.4s)]
*  I'm fine with either one. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3222.4s)]
*  I'm fine with either one. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3224.4s)]
*  We've got a little loose end. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3226.4s)]
*  This one is definitely here to decorate. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3228.4s)]
*  There's a lot of diamonds. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3230.4s)]
*  This person exists. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3232.4s)]
*  Because we don't have enough pretty things. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3234.4s)]
*  Wait, you're right. I feel like this will hold the lights up more. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3236.4s)]
*  This is more for the bear. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3238.4s)]
*  She squished up on her tree so quickly. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3240.4s)]
*  That's a big thing. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3242.4s)]
*  Well, I'm thinking about what we have. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3244.4s)]
*  And he's got balls and lights. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3246.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3248.4s)]
*  I want this one. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3250.4s)]
*  It's so beautiful. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3252.4s)]
*  I would never get this one. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3254.4s)]
*  I think I do know why Brianna Wu doesn't get it. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3256.4s)]
*  Because she's just f***ing s*** it. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3258.4s)]
*  Like, that's it. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3260.4s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like it's going to start shedding. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3262.4s)]
*  So, she...I don't think she understands this even as a trans... [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3264.4s)]
*  ...proves you're not a man. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3268.4s)]
*  Brianna Wu...before we do that it seems like [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3270.4s)]
*  Brianna Wu was trying to get [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3272.4s)]
*  JK Rowling. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3274.4s)]
*  Never forget gender identity isn't about sex stereotypes [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3276.4s)]
*  so playing around with your hair proves you're not a man. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3278.4s)]
*  Brianna Wu, I know that there's an angry crowd [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3280.4s)]
*  that will never believe trans women are an admittedly weird [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3282.4s)]
*  variation of woman. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3284.4s)]
*  But for people in the middle here's 25 minutes of doll cast show [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3286.4s)]
*  just talking about doing our hair. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3288.4s)]
*  Can anyone honestly say we would make sense [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3290.4s)]
*  of living as men? [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3292.4s)]
*  JK Rowling saw that. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3294.4s)]
*  And got very mad about it. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3296.4s)]
*  And said never forget gender identity isn't about sex stereotypes. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3298.4s)]
*  But playing around with your hair [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3300.4s)]
*  proves you're not a man. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3302.4s)]
*  Brianna Wu responded to her [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3304.4s)]
*  with this long ass effort pose. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3306.4s)]
*  Miss Rowling, first of all [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3308.4s)]
*  our show is about moderate trans positions. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3310.4s)]
*  If you watched it you probably agree with many of our positions. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3312.4s)]
*  We don't support trans women in sports. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3314.4s)]
*  We have severe reservations about [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3316.4s)]
*  the trans fringe. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3318.4s)]
*  We don't like the way it's medicalizing children [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3320.4s)]
*  particularly young girls. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3322.4s)]
*  And that's considering two of our hosts transition as minors. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3324.4s)]
*  This clip about four trans women [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3326.4s)]
*  in the extreme right. Neither of them [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3328.4s)]
*  forced us to live as men. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3330.4s)]
*  There's a political project pushing everyone to the extremes [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3332.4s)]
*  right now. I've taken a lot of heat [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3334.4s)]
*  denouncing the trans fringe. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3336.4s)]
*  It's really funny because for everyone [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3338.4s)]
*  you are welcome on the doll cast show [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3340.4s)]
*  anytime. And it's really funny because [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3342.4s)]
*  achievement unlocked. Both India [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3344.4s)]
*  Willoughby and JK Rowling hate the moderate trans [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3346.4s)]
*  politics of doll cast. India attacked us the other day [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3348.4s)]
*  and we responded. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3350.4s)]
*  I just spoke the logic [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3352.4s)]
*  there. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3354.4s)]
*  People think they've understood my humanity. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3356.4s)]
*  Transphobia. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3358.4s)]

*  All right thank you. What do you think? He said we need to usually get a manager involved [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3597.36s)]
*  when there's a 10-footer on the display trees. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3603.76s)]
*  Ray I got the one that you want. You said that it was good. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3608.64s)]
*  Instead of the fat one. That one's got some ball spas on it too. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3615.44s)]
*  Yeah oh that right there. Yeah that's one of those drones. There it is. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3622.16s)]

*  No one's talking about them. Isn't that one already prepped? Oh so all you guys do is net it? [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3636.96s)]
*  Yeah we were gonna net it. Um we were gonna. It's not gonna fit. It ain't gonna fit so we'd have to take the base out [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3643.84s)]
*  or we could throw it on top without the net and just tie it down. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3651.28s)]
*  Murat. I was gonna put it with the net on top just two of them next to each other and then two [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3654.88s)]
*  ratchet straps across. That's up to you. I mean if we net it we'll have to take the base off but if [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3658.5600000000004s)]
*  you want to keep it on. Yeah yeah. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3663.6800000000003s)]
*  It's kind of like a big screw. It's a big screw. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3673.92s)]
*  It's a screw. If not we would have just thrown it on top of the car and tied it down. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3676.72s)]
*  So I got the rack like I said I was gonna put two knitted ones next to each other and then two [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3683.3599999999997s)]
*  ratchet straps across. Okay so I mean you might not need the net necessarily for this one. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3687.8399999999997s)]
*  I mean if you hear the net makes it easier to handle and like the base is kind of big. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3694.3999999999996s)]
*  Take up the the base is too big. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3701.04s)]
*  Dude I'm so this is I'm overstimulated and also oh [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3706.16s)]

*  So you're getting it with the stand? No Murat wanted to unscrew it for transportation. Okay so we still need to buy the stand then? [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3721.52s)]
*  No it comes with that. It peed. It peed yeah. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3740.16s)]

*  We can we can cut it though because we're gonna stick up the stand anyway. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3768.6400000000003s)]
*  You want to take a foot off of it? Yeah let's take a foot off the bottom. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3773.44s)]

*  was talking about to myself that would make it bigger inches not centimeters. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3792.72s)]
*  All right uh let's purchase. Do you have your thing? He wants to watch the process. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9edXujuBppw&t=3806.9599999999996s)]
