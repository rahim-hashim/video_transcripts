# Trump Wants To 'Take Back' The Panama Canal | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [December 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8)
*  Donald Trump is so invested in, in purchasing Greenland. I guess we could dive into the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=0.0s)]
*  Johnny CIA cinematic universe, Harris, Canada and Panama are sovereign say successively be [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=7.68s)]
*  taken over as madness. Trump tweeted out, we'll see about that. Trump now more directly [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=12.48s)]
*  threatening to take full control of the Panama canal. Just hours after Panama's president vowed [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=22.8s)]
*  that every square mile would remain under Panamanian control. President Panama responds [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=26.16s)]
*  to Trump's threats. Every square meter of Panama canal belongs to Panama and will continue belonging [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=30.64s)]
*  to Panama. We'll see about that. What is happening? He's also talked about, he's also personally [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=34.4s)]
*  talked about how, Oh my God, dude, I'm not why I'm not reading this effort post. You're out of your [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=41.68s)]
*  mind. I'd rather watch a YouTube video on a significance. If you want. He's also talked [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  about invading Canada. He's talked about invading Mexico. Trump companies accused of tax evasion [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=51.36s)]
*  in Panama. That's crazy. And the latest is from 2019. He was president back then. He could have [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=56.32s)]
*  done something about it. He's talking about retaining ownership over Greenland too. And also [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=62.16s)]
*  huge right-wing accounts are posting news about radical American imperial territorial expansion [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=68.0s)]
*  right now talking about like invading Canada and invading Mexico, which is because like I joke [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=71.52s)]
*  about invading Canada all the time. And now it's like, like you can't be serious about this. You [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=76.88s)]
*  know what I mean? Now I can't even joke about this shit. Like I can't even joke about invading [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=82.08s)]
*  Canada and delivering them that sweet freedom, sweet healthcare freedom that they want, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=87.19999999999999s)]
*  that they desperately desire. They 100% want to put ICBM interceptors and early radar on Greenland. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I assume that that is the case. It's just that like international collaboration and [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=98.64s)]
*  cooperation become less international collaboration, like security treaties become harder to enforce [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=104.64s)]
*  when other countries find you to be a dangerous, volatile maniac. This is why I talked [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=113.52s)]
*  extensively about Joe Biden ruining America's soft power capabilities by consistently allowing [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=121.92s)]
*  Israel to do a shit side in Gaza and giving them the weapons to do so. When you do that, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=130.56s)]
*  all of a sudden the world may interpret the world may turn around and perhaps interpret [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=136.72s)]
*  800 military bases as 800 different invasions. You don't want that when your soft power capabilities [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=143.76s)]
*  diminish, all of a sudden your security contracts, your security cooperation agreements turn into [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=150.0s)]
*  just forward military invasions. Okay. It's not great. And that prompted the Arctic Islands leader [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=158.24s)]
*  to confirm that it's not for sale. The next US president has also noticed that Elon Musk is [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=165.28s)]
*  stealing some of his media limelight, but if he's irritated, he's disguising it well. No, he's not [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=171.36s)]
*  taking the president's. Oh, he, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude. The fact that he said [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=178.0s)]
*  that, Oh, it's so Jover. I mean, it was the easiest lock. It was the easiest lock that he was going [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=183.76000000000002s)]
*  to be irritated with Elon Musk and that, and that obviously the, the most, the clearest, the, the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=190.24s)]
*  clearest person, the, the, the fact that like people say, Oh, president Elon Musk was going to [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  get to him. The easiest bait of all time. I mean, this is not a very difficult lock. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=203.04000000000002s)]
*  I like having smart people, you know, the, they're on a new kick Russia, Russia, Russia, Ukraine, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=208.88000000000002s)]
*  Ukraine, Ukraine, all the different hoaxes. And the new one is president Trump has seeded [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=214.32000000000002s)]
*  the presidency to Elon Musk. No, no, no. Oh, he's pissed. Oh, he's fucking pissed. That's not [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=221.04000000000002s)]
*  happening. And I'm safe. You know why he can't be. He wasn't born in this country. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=231.68s)]
*  Hey, yo, that's easy. Oh no. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=237.68s)]
*  Speaking at the same event last night, Matt Gates, Trump's first brief pick for attorney general. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=244.88s)]
*  We all see that bro's going to deport Elon dude. Bro is going to deport him. They are, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=251.12s)]
*  he's going to deport his ass. Oh my God. Elon's going to get deported. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=256.96s)]
*  That Elon is acting alongside president Trump in the national interest. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=261.03999999999996s)]
*  Today, a congressional report revealed why he was forced to withdraw, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=265.84s)]
*  accusing the former congressman of regularly taking drugs and paying for sex, including with [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=270.32s)]
*  a 17 year old girl, though he denies it all. But such scandals are grist to this president's mill. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=275.76s)]
*  The golden age of America is upon us. It took him 75 minutes to ramble [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=283.52s)]
*  through more familiar pledges to shut borders and prosecute his rivals. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=289.76s)]
*  And Mr. Trump's inauguration is now less than a month away. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=299.59999999999997s)]
*  I was amazed this when that requirement is not necessary for the speaker position. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=303.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I know you don't even need to be a politician in Congress to be a speaker, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=309.35999999999996s)]
*  but hold on one moment. Hello. Hello. Hello. I don't see you bro at five 30. Oh, wow. Okay. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=314.96s)]
*  I'm ready, brother. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'll be back. All right, dude. You got a juice tangled blast. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=321.91999999999996s)]
*  Okay. Five 30. I'm going to be playing Marvel rivals. Let's continue with this for now. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=329.52s)]
*  Um, you might be wondering why, uh, Donald Trump is so invested in, in purchasing Greenland. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=333.76s)]
*  I guess we could dive into the, uh, Johnny CIA cinematic universe, Harris, Canada and Panama [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=341.44s)]
*  are sovereign say success and to be taken over as madness. But Greenland is essentially a colony [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=347.91999999999996s)]
*  of Denmark. The Danish invest no money in the populace. And it is literally the most depressed [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=352.4s)]
*  place on earth with a suicide rate two X of South Korea. The U S in my opinion could be in capacity [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=355.52s)]
*  in investing more in Greenland and it would be good for scientific endeavors too. So it was [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=361.28s)]
*  bad about a purchase. I'm just in, I'm never in favor of American territorial expansion [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=364.71999999999997s)]
*  on, uh, on principle. Just that's it. Like even if it's for good reasons, I still don't think it's [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=369.84s)]
*  good. I still personally, I still personally think they'll do it. They'll the only science they're [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=374.79999999999995s)]
*  interested in is oil. Yeah. They're going to turn Greenland into a massive military base. The irony [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=379.44s)]
*  is like the irony here is just like, dude, I don't understand America could invest a lot [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=384.32s)]
*  more than, than Denmark could is so funny because it's like, okay, America can invest a lot in its [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=390.16s)]
*  own country as well and chooses not to do so. Like, I just don't think that America's is ever going [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=398.08000000000004s)]
*  to, to, to invest in people, uh, in a way that is, is positive for them. That's fair. I think buying [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=408.24s)]
*  Greenland would mean expansion of air force naval bases there, but Denmark is an Imperial owner, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=414.32000000000005s)]
*  a horrible Imperial owner. Maybe Denmark will be better, uh, to Greenland. Not if you're not better [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=418.4s)]
*  to Greenland, we might take it from you. Actually. I think that, yeah, you could become the new Okinawa [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=425.2s)]
*  chatter, get ready for drunk driving service members in a galore. Like there is, there is never a place [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=430.32s)]
*  where America has dramatically improved, uh, the living standards or the conditions at all [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=436.64s)]
*  after building fat military bases on top of that area. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7TjR-D6o8&t=442.4s)]
