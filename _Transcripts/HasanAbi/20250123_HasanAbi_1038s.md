# Hasan And The Journey To Conquer Japan
**HasanAbi:** [January 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU)
*  Um, yeah, I got deported. I'm in Japan. Okay. Oh yeah. They deported me to Japan. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=0.0s)]
*  It's the only positive deportation story of all time would be the case. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=4.7s)]
*  Um, we got six Japanese people, uh, watching. That's crazy. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=9.700000000000001s)]
*  I only got six Japanese people. I got so much love for my Japanese audience. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  And there's only six of you. That's crazy. Anyway. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=19.1s)]
*  You live from, you might have guessed it broke Mike for a second. I immediately broke it. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=22.2s)]
*  Yes. Sunny Tokyo, Japan. That's right. Oh, I, uh, sumimasen. Oh, hi. Oh, gozai musta. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=34.2s)]
*  This is going to be janky. Anyway, the power, the power of, of the, the elation I feel in my bones of being in Nihon. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=46.2s)]
*  This made me break the microphone immediately. Folks were here. We're live. We're alive from the place where it all began. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=61.2s)]
*  My birthright, my Wakanda white boy, Wakanda. We are in Japan. Ladies and gentlemen, I hope everyone's having a fantastic one because I certainly am. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=72.2s)]
*  It is official. Well, it's technically 1 51 PM Pacific time, Thursday, January 23rd, 2025, but here in Japan, it's actually tomorrow. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=84.2s)]
*  It's actually Friday, January 24th, 20, 25. And it's the local time is six 51. It took me a long time. I thought I would be ready to rip this an hour ago. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=95.2s)]
*  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to rip it an hour ago, but I'm in the future. Hello. Hello. I'm in the future guys. Let me tell you. Okay. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=106.2s)]
*  And the future is not looking too bright. I mean, it's looking bright for me because I'm in Japan, which is awesome, but it's not looking too bright in general. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=114.2s)]
*  Obviously, there's a lot to talk about and we'll get to all of it. You already know what it is, baby. Non-stop. You might be thinking, Hassan, how do you do this? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=123.2s)]
*  How do you do this? How does my goat do this? Yesterday, you were in Los Angeles, California. Today, you're in freaking Japan. How does that work? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=132.2s)]
*  And honestly, that's just how, that's just how we do a baby. That's just how we do it. All right. So this is the part of the broadcast where I tell you about my personal news about what's going on in the world of a son. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=145.2s)]
*  Hassan, I'm a piker, but I guess there's not much that has taken place in the world of a song. Hassan, I'm a piker other than a 12 hour flight. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=158.2s)]
*  I ended the broadcast last night in Los Angeles. I ended. Oh, there's in towers here. Don't worry. Yeah, I'm comfy. I'm cozy. I'm comfy. You can see right here. I wanted to make sure I wanted to make sure I brought all my things with me. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=168.2s)]
*  Right. I'll pack them shits up. Oh yeah. Swin. The Swin towers are here. I got my creatine and all my other supplements. It's just like fish oil pills and stuff like that. But yeah, I packed all that stuff. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=185.2s)]
*  I got in a car, got to the airport, got on a plane and blew to honey. The airport. That's right. I took an ANA flight all neat bone all the time. And I'll tell you some only bone air. Not the best. Not the best flight. No disrespect to the Japanese people. No [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=200.2s)]
*  culture, no disrespect, but your seats are small. Okay. Like I flew businesses. It's lie flat. And let me tell you, it was hard for me to lie flat. Okay. My feet, my little feet sees we're not fitting. Okay. So just, you know, day one, day one, first frame, single frame L already took that. Okay. I'll eat it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=225.2s)]
*  Slept for most of it regardless, even though it was hard at first, I didn't realize that they, I was like, oh, it's weird that they don't have a comforter, right? A blankie. And turns out I was just sleeping on the blankie. I was using the blankie as a pillow. But once I figured out the blankie situation, and they also give you like a little pad that you can put on the life. I see once I was able to put that pad on the life last seat and get a little blankie. I was, I was snuggled up. I was good. I was [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=250.2s)]
*  in a much better circumstance, you know, but how many farts I didn't fart that much this time. Surprisingly enough. I also didn't eat, which is kind of crazy. I had like a bunch of the food at the star Alliance lounge at the LA eggs. But it's that food is dog is terrible. But I just, you know, ate a bunch of sandwiches basically before I got on the plane. And then I just fell asleep. And then I woke up and I didn't really eat anything. So not a lot of, not a lot of food. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=280.2s)]
*  I didn't want to do the farts on the on the flight. Didn't want to do war for all of the Japanese people that are just trying to go home. You know, I don't want to do that to them. But aside from that, aside from that, and I hope it's not too dark, by the way, because as soon as the sun starts rising here, I feel like it's probably going to get cooked. I'm going to have to figure out a different thing. But I wanted to show you the background. You know, I wanted to show you what's happening out here. But is Japan not your spiritual home? It is. It is. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=310.2s)]
*  My spiritual home. I'm all I'm all messed up as far as like where I am in the world and what day it is and what time it is like. But I'm trying to do my best here. So did you fly with Fusili? No, I flew by myself. I didn't fly with anybody. I was supposed to fly with Austin, but I couldn't fly. I couldn't fly with Austin because he's he's on the plane right now. And I wanted to make sure that I could stream the day prior and then stream [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=340.2s)]
*  the next day. So they don't really consider someone of your size, especially in Tokyo. I agree. How long are you Japan for? I'm here for two weeks, baby. It starts now. It begins now from here on out. I am going to do my very best to start streams much, much earlier than today. Obviously, today is a is a unique day because I just flew in and I landed at my start time like I landed at five a.m. You know what I mean? And it's only [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=370.2s)]
*  like I said, it's only seven. It's only seven a.m. just now. So for that reason, I'm a little delayed, but usually it'll be like at least two hours prior to this, hopefully. Or, you know, I'm going to try to start at five a.m. here every morning to give you guys some news, some updates, everything that's going on in the world. And then we'll move on to some fun stuff. The IRL stuff is also going to feature, you know, political stuff here as well. I'm going to go to the the [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=400.2s)]
*  Japanese cafe that has like the Palestine Prince, which I think is very cool. Hold on. This mic arm is so as. But yeah, my as I've said already, my goal is to basically stream. My goal is to basically stream the regular broadcast broadcast that I do here for like the first three, four hours and then, you know, do my politics and stuff and then do fun stuff after do some IRL stuff. So yeah. And we'll also [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=430.2s)]
*  obviously shoot the fear and podcast as well while we're out here. Hopefully we're going to look we're going to lock in two episodes if possible. And I'll also be doing some podcast collabs as well while we're out here. The roomies are out here as well. You should remember a full desktop. You brought it with you. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=460.2s)]
*  Yeah, I always I I have a remote desktop setup that I bring with me everywhere I go so I can have the same quality streams uninterrupted and seamless for your viewership enjoyment. And that's why you should subscribe for six dollars or for free with the Twitch prime to support the show if you would like to. If you don't want to, then it's fine as well. You can also send me links. But yeah, you guys saw what the setup looks like at the DNC. We actually filmed ourselves breaking down the setup, ironically enough. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=480.4s)]
*  But I am in Tokyo. You can literally see the Tokyo needle bouncing off the building behind me. I think that's Tokyo needle. What laptop is the Legion? Yeah. Please go to the bars with Connor. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=510.4s)]

*  though, I mean, it was mostly him. He said the setup this time. Normally I set it up, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=590.1800000000001s)]
*  but he set it up this time. So I was pooping, but didn't even shower. Honestly. Like I just [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=593.38s)]
*  straight up changed my shirt, put these, took the sleeves off and I'm ready to rip dude. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=598.22s)]
*  I'm ready to let it go. Okay. Well, yeah, we're here. I had so many strawberries earlier. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=605.1s)]
*  Okay. I had so many goddamn strawberries. They, it was crazy. The strawberries were amazing. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=613.46s)]

*  didn't stay at that house. This time we, everybody wanted to stay at the hotel because we're here [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=627.4200000000001s)]
*  for a while. Everybody was like, I'd rather stay at a hotel than, you know, stay at the [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=632.64s)]
*  house again. It's mostly Austin. Austin won. Austin won that battle, dude. You know, he [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=640.64s)]
*  won that battle. He was right. We it's better to stay in the hotel, I guess. But yeah, is [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=646.78s)]
*  it not a Scottish risk to show the view? Dog, I'm in a hotel. What are you talking about? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=652.32s)]
*  What are you going to do? Figure out autistically what room I'm staying in to come and like [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=656.4s)]
*  kill me. You have to like I'm in Japan. I'm in a hotel, please. Like in the past we had [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=661.64s)]
*  in the past when we did when we do content in like like a regular location, it was it was a [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=669.3199999999999s)]
*  little different, you know, in a stable location. But like, did you guys get the upgrade? Like [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=675.0s)]
*  Austin said, he got it for himself. That selfish bastard. But we didn't get it. Yeah, I got [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=678.88s)]
*  deported. I'm in Japan. Okay. Oh, yeah. They deported me to Japan. It's the only positive [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=683.0s)]
*  deportation story of all time would be the case. We've got six Japanese people watching. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=688.64s)]
*  That's crazy. I only got six Japanese people. I got so much love for my Japanese audience. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=696.84s)]

*  actually Japanese on this day. We are all Japanese, myself included. But yeah, what is [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=706.36s)]
*  this? I was really upset with your clothing shoes yesterday. Those things are creepsville, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=713.2s)]

*  Early bird gets to be the most Sugoi. And I don't think a lot of people in Japan are ready [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=724.64s)]
*  for that story. You know what I mean? They don't have the American enterprise mentality [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=729.5600000000001s)]
*  that we do out here. They don't got it. They don't got that American mentality here. Just [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=733.4s)]
*  kidding. They're also hyper capitalist society. Okay. But yeah, let's blast off. I'm in [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=740.16s)]
*  Japan. I'm in Japan. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=746.52s)]

*  exploration later. Why do you call it the Burger Reich? Because it is. Because it's like, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=763.64s)]
*  like, because America is like Adolf Hitler, but burger. That's why I'm calling it the [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=773.12s)]
*  Burger Reich. Because imagine if it was like Adolf Hitler, but with burger. The question, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=777.8399999999999s)]
*  has anyone recognized you yet? I mean, I got into the hotel and the first person I actually [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=785.8s)]
*  talked to recognized me, the dude at the check-in. So I guess, yeah, the answer to your question [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=789.52s)]
*  is yes. The only person I have communicated with happened to also be a fan so far. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkJE3glmJU&t=796.36s)]
