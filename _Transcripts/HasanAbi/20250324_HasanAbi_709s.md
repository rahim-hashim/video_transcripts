# Elon Musk FURIOUS Over Criticism | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA)
*  Like it doesn't work that way. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=0.0s)]
*  Litigation of the sort only is there to protect wealthy people against not powerful poor people. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=3.4s)]
*  You know, this might be a new level of writing for Elon. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=11.02s)]
*  I'm done. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=19.44s)]
*  I'm done. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=20.44s)]
*  I'm done. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=21.44s)]
*  I've seen your Trump. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=22.44s)]
*  I've had enough. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=25.580000000000002s)]
*  Elon Musk reaches final straw with Dem attacks. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=26.580000000000002s)]
*  He's had enough guys. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=29.32s)]
*  Okay, quit. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=30.6s)]
*  Quit everything. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=32.36s)]
*  Quit your job at the administration. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=33.36s)]
*  Quit your job at Tesla. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=36.92s)]
*  You don't really have a job to be fair, but [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=38.76s)]
*  advisor Elon Musk has faced repeated and very personal attacks since he's teamed up with [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=41.6s)]
*  president Trump and started Doge. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=46.96s)]
*  The left has called him everything from a con man to an oligarch and even worse than [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=48.84s)]
*  that. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=54.28s)]
*  Elon Musk is incompetent in his position. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=56.04s)]
*  And how do we know? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=59.56s)]
*  Because they fired tens of thousands of people was challenged in court. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=60.56s)]
*  The court said the people have to go back and now the people are coming back. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=64.42s)]
*  He's incompetent. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=68.08s)]
*  He's a thief. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=69.68s)]
*  He's a Nazi and people don't trust him. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=71.06s)]
*  Jamal Bowman saying someone's incompetent in their position. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=74.08s)]
*  Didn't you lose your seat to George Latimer? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=77.56s)]
*  Oh yeah, that happened. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=79.16s)]
*  Yeah, Apex spent $7 billion, dude. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=80.16s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=84.08s)]
*  Didn't you lose your seat to George Latimer after Apex spent $30 million? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=85.08s)]
*  That was the actual number. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=91.52s)]
*  Seven billion. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=92.52s)]
*  I'm exaggerating, obviously. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=93.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=94.52s)]
*  Remember when the Israel lobby forced you out of a position by dumping a historic amount [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=95.52s)]
*  of money into a Democratic primary? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=99.4s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=102.52s)]
*  Well, now Musk says he is done with this and he shot back at Bowman's comments posting [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=103.52s)]
*  I've had enough lawsuit inbound. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=108.52s)]
*  And Attorney General Pam Bondi also sending a warning to Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=111.68s)]
*  after this remark. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=116.76s)]
*  I am truly here for very selfish reasons. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=119.12s)]
*  Starting with on March 29th, it's my birthday and all I want to see happen on my birthday [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=123.48s)]
*  is for Elon to be taken down. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=129.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=131.52s)]
*  This is domestic. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=132.52s)]
*  And Maria, now you have this Congresswoman Crockett who is calling for a tax on Elon [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=133.52s)]
*  Musk on her birthday. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=138.72s)]
*  Let's take him out on my birthday, she says. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=140.96s)]
*  And yet she turns and says, oh, I'm not calling for. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=143.8s)]
*  Well, she is an elected public official. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=146.44s)]
*  And so she needs to tread very carefully because nothing will happen to Elon Musk. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=149.4s)]
*  You know, Paul, as I look at this, you know, Jasmine Crockett not encouraging any sort [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=154.60000000000002s)]
*  of I still don't know why you would make a remark like that. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=159.60000000000002s)]
*  But putting her aside and looking broadly at what's happening with Tesla, the FBI, I [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=162.4s)]
*  was looking at their website about what domestic terrorism is. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=166.24s)]
*  You can see this when you intend to intimidate or coerce the civilian population, influence [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=169.12s)]
*  the policy of government. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=173.86s)]
*  Several of these acts clearly are intended to do just that. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=175.4s)]
*  The problem is we don't have a domestic terrorism law at the federal level because in the world [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=179.0s)]
*  federally you have to have a connection to a foreign power. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=183.76s)]
*  So when we say a domestic incident, it can be without actually charging it. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=186.44s)]
*  And that's why something like I think it's about up to 35 states have laws so that they [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=191.12s)]
*  can do just that. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=195.56s)]
*  After the Walkiesha Parade, the Christmas Parade, the Guy Joke, the Rappel, everybody [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=196.8s)]
*  wanted that to be terrorist. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=199.98000000000002s)]
*  There's not a federal statute that's on point. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=201.4s)]
*  And the reason for that is that on the right, the fear is that it would be weaponized against [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=203.44s)]
*  the right. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=208.12s)]
*  And that's generally the debate you see in legal circles. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=209.12s)]
*  So that's just sort of the framework. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=211.4s)]
*  But what you can do, what you can do is number one, follow the money. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  And that goes to some of the stuff that goes on on these campuses. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=216.92000000000002s)]
*  There's been significant reporting, responsible reporting that there is Iranian money going [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=219.16000000000003s)]
*  into some of these groups that act on campuses. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=224.04000000000002s)]
*  Well, now you have a tie to Iranian money. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=226.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's so bountiful, this Iranian money that we just simply haven't been able to find [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=229.23999999999998s)]
*  it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=234.95999999999998s)]
*  We have simply been unable to find it. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=236.39999999999998s)]
*  So now we're just lying. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=239.23999999999998s)]
*  We were lying initially. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=240.88s)]
*  The Biden administration was lying about it too initially. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=242.07999999999998s)]
*  And we're also still lying. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=245.04s)]
*  I like it when you look at your phone, your points are less frequent and more poignant. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=247.0s)]
*  Thanks chatter. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=250.48s)]
*  Well, foreign nation. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=251.48s)]
*  Okay, so that's potentially a charge at the federal level. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=252.48s)]
*  But what you can also do is what Musk is talking about, which is... [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=254.76s)]
*  Why can't Fox be sued for this slander? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=257.44s)]
*  Chatters, please stop thinking that litigation is going to work at your behest against a [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=259.52s)]
*  f**king f**king administrative state that is unironically dismantling, unironically [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=265.15999999999997s)]
*  creating a constitutional crisis over direct court orders right now. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=270.84s)]
*  Like they're not even listening to judges that would volunteer to f**king sign off on [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=274.64s)]
*  mass deportation. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=279.8s)]
*  And the one time where they're like, Hey, can we get to see if these guys are actually [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=281.6s)]
*  who you say that they are? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=287.04s)]
*  Like if they've ever done a crime and they're like f**k you, f**k my d**k. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=288.56s)]
*  And you're over here being like, Oh, why don't we sue Fox News for defamation? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=292.04s)]
*  Like it doesn't work that way. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=296.6s)]
*  Litigation of this sort only is there to protect wealthy people against not powerful poor people. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=299.64000000000004s)]
*  You know, this might be a new level of writing for Elon. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=307.28000000000003s)]
*  What is this? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=310.88s)]
*  Pulling up to the Tesla protest? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=312.56s)]
*  What? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=314.56s)]
*  No, this is AI, right? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=315.56s)]
*  No, this is definitely not real. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=317.64s)]
*  I can't tell because the cars look so AI. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=321.76s)]
*  Yeah, we need to make this a reality. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=324.4s)]
*  It's definitely not real. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=327.04s)]
*  I have a sneaking suspicion that like, is there a lot of animosity and people are vandalizing [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=328.64s)]
*  them? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=335.56s)]
*  Are some of these stories just like a Psyop so they can basically say if you've ever been [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=337.44s)]
*  mean in the vicinity, if you ever had road rage against the f**king Tesla driver, you're [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=342.44s)]
*  now a terrorist. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=348.28000000000003s)]
*  I think that's the, I think that's more likely the case. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=349.56s)]
*  Because I feel like, I feel like there's a way above and beyond in terms of how much [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=354.32s)]
*  coverage it's getting and there's how much like people are, you know, attacking Jews [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=361.92s)]
*  deserve to live. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=367.08000000000004s)]
*  Wow. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=368.92s)]
*  Controversial statement. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=369.92s)]
*  Why would you think I disagree with this? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=371.74s)]
*  Are you f**king insane? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=373.96000000000004s)]
*  Yes, I agree. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=375.44s)]
*  I think everyone deserves to live. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=376.96000000000004s)]
*  What the f**k? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=379.36s)]
*  Did you think I was going to be like, you dude? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=380.36s)]
*  Like you have to ask, you have to ask yourself who convinced you that I would be against [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=383.32s)]
*  a statement like this because you have been misguided. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=391.88s)]
*  You have, you have been played a fool. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=397.88s)]
*  What the f**k? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=401.48s)]
*  First statement. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=404.4s)]
*  At least when the D people will come in, they will put some effort into their bait. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=405.4s)]
*  The East stands might be some of the dumbest shadows you've ever had to come in. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=410.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=412.6s)]
*  The, the quality of the baiting has, has fallen apart. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=413.6s)]

*  or do you think once you're gone from the chat, we'll figure out that you've left the [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=607.5600000000001s)]
*  chat and then we'll get to the secret Jew hatred. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=612.08s)]

*  Maybe someone is telling you that they are the only true. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=624.76s)]
*  Yeah, I know you were trying to get fucking banned for it. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=630.36s)]

*  Why would we ban you for this? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=634.84s)]
*  If you came in here to get banned for this statement, that implies that you think that [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=636.1600000000001s)]
*  we ban people from making statements like this. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=641.4399999999999s)]
*  This is not a statement that is inappropriate at all. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=643.4399999999999s)]
*  It's not a ban worthy statement. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=646.84s)]
*  The statement that 99.999% of people that are in this community agree with and the 0.001% [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=649.28s)]
*  of people that don't agree with it are the fucking haters that are in here that are neo-Nazis [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=658.1999999999999s)]
*  waiting to whisper at every single fucking chatter that I pull up on screen to be like, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=663.4s)]
*  hey, I'll have you know, you should read Culture of Critique. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=668.0s)]
*  This Hitler guy had some really good ideas because they're fucking dumbasses who think [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=671.38s)]
*  they can like Hitler pill people in this community. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=674.54s)]
*  So I asked the question once again, who led you to believe that this would be a ban worthy [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=678.26s)]
*  statement in this community? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=685.12s)]
*  And why do you believe that person still? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=686.86s)]
*  If you are so off base as to think that this is a ban worthy statement in this community [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=690.9s)]
*  and not one that we agree with, like, shouldn't you feel a little bit wronged by the person [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=695.34s)]
*  who diluted you into thinking this? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6zyIifGAA&t=702.1800000000001s)]
