*  Go clip that and say wow hasana's so anti-semitic for a very clear cut [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=342.65999999999997s)]
*  It's coming from a hasbra fanfic. Yeah, here's the doc pages three and four literally disprove the allegations above it [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=349.14s)]
*  It's the way what do you mean? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=355.7s)]
*  In his reply mr. Mahdawi stated that in november 2015 fbi agent mark emmins interviewed him concerning the allegations [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=358.26s)]
*  Mr. Mahdawi confirmed that he had visited the gun shop in the precision museum [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=363.46s)]
*  But he had never discussed buying weapons or jews [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=366.5s)]
*  His purpose in visiting the gun shop was to learn whether he was required to register [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=368.74s)]
*  A shotgun his wife had given him as a present there was no registration requirement for a gift [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=371.94s)]
*  He went to the museum because it's located just a few blocks from where he lived and he's interested in machines previously studied engineering [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=375.94s)]
*  Mr. Mahdawi states the states that the fbi agent was satisfied with his explanation and closed the investigation [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=382.9s)]
*  He denies possessing illegal drugs in 2019. The domestic incident was an argument that led to no charges today [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=388.1s)]
*  His ex-wife is a close friend and supporter [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=393.06s)]
*  Wow seems like the fbi is in on it, too [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=396.5s)]
*  Yeah, I have it on good authority that the fbi also he also told the fbi agent that he wanted the jews and the fbi agent was [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=399.78s)]
*  Like me too [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=406.1s)]
*  And they high-fived and that's why he let him go at the course request agent emmins appeared at the hearing on the motion for release [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=407.38s)]
*  The government raised concerns the questioning. Mr. Em is about his investigation could compromise national security concerns [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=413.21999999999997s)]
*  The government agreed with mr. Mahdawi that mr [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=417.38s)]
*  Em is his investigation ended in 2015 although not closed in any official way and that there were no charges against mr [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=419.78s)]
*  Mahdawi or any other unfavorable action the government states that [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=424.34s)]
*  It has some other information that is not shared with the court the court is satisfied that the information the police report does not support [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=427.94s)]
*  A finding of dangerousness if the fbi had substantiated the information some action would have resulted [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=432.18s)]
*  That nothing took place supports. Mr. Mahdawi's description of meeting with sa emmins as satisfying him that the two informants were not truthful [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=437.06s)]
*  Wow, wow [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=444.74s)]
*  Look at that. How deep does this conspiracy go? Perhaps? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=446.5s)]
*  Perhaps the fbi agent was also secretly in on it [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=450.5s)]
*  Mr. Mahdawi states that after the number 22 for election certain groups launched a deportation campaign against me and declared that they had reported me to the [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=453.7s)]
*  Trump admin so that I may be deported for my speech in support of palestinian rights, which literally did happen. That's not even a conspiracy theory [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=459.14s)]
*  That's a conspiracy to try and get this dude deported the fact that the allegations were immediately disproven right after and they're still scary [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=465.54s)]
*  Sharing that screenshot. Yes, because a lot of these guys as you all know are in bad faith [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=472.1s)]
*  I was just in a bathroom and scotch innings was at the next urinal. He told me he's part of trender agua crazy stuff, man [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=477.38s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I heard too [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=483.70000000000005s)]
*  I heard dude, dude guys. I went down to florida. Okay [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=485.62s)]
*  I went down to florida to palm springs to a friend's house [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=490.82000000000005s)]
*  Okay, he kept calling it the white house of the south. I don't know what it was. It was a massive gaudy ass [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=493.94s)]
*  Mansion, I think it was like a like a golf club or whatever [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=499.54s)]
*  And there I saw donald trump randomly who's on his fingers. Okay [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=502.5s)]
*  And the tattoo said m s 1 and 3 clearly spelled it out and then donald trump said [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=507.62s)]
*  I actually am an active member of al-qaeda isis and trender agua and also ms 13 [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=512.98s)]
*  But ms 13 I used to be a part of i'm no longer a part of it [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=520.1800000000001s)]
*  But I haven't got my tattoos lasered off. Isn't that crazy? Yeah, it's true. I was the tattoo artist [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=523.22s)]
*  It's just like what the is this what it like I can't believe [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=529.62s)]
*  He literally precisely clipped the court document new york times. Someone needs to be fired [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=533.7s)]
*  Oh my god, these guys man, dude, why? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=538.9000000000001s)]
*  Why is [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=542.34s)]
*  Why is every pro israel guy's first note to be like someone has to be fired for this? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=544.1800000000001s)]
*  Someone has to be fired [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=550.1s)]

*  Which leads me to my next point, which is kneecap [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=564.0200000000001s)]
*  BBC uk has posted about every single sold out tour [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=567.6s)]
*  On their tour [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVKtOOyeSA&t=574.18s)]
