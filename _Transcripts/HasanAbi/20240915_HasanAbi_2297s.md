# JD Vance Debate Dana Bash About Haitian Immigrants | Hasanabi React
**HasanAbi:** [September 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY)
*  I wonder who is at fault for Springfield, Ohio being in an absolute state of disrepair. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=0.0s)]
*  It must be the Haitian migrants or the Democratic Party. What is going on? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=10.48s)]
*  Because Donald Trump got shat again! [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=47.12s)]
*  At this point it's like, JD Vance is gonna come out next week and be like, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=49.12s)]
*  I'm a white supremacist, I love the Klan, and I think we should start black people, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=54.16s)]
*  and then Trump's gonna get shat again and people are gonna forget! [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=59.36s)]
*  You know? He didn't even get shat, but you know what I mean. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=62.48s)]
*  Every time JD Vance says some sh- Trump gets an assassination attempt on his ass! [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=65.12s)]
*  What the- is going on? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=70.8s)]
*  Harris and former President Donald Trump are focusing on the states that will decide [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=72.32s)]
*  the next president, with the race apparently deadlocked after what could be the only [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=77.36s)]
*  Harris-Trump debate. But Donald Trump is also doubling down on a baseless claim that he made [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=82.96s)]
*  at the debate, that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio are eating people's pets. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=88.39999999999999s)]
*  Local officials and the state's Republican governor say there is absolutely no evidence [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=93.84s)]
*  of that claim, and they are warning it is actually hurting their city. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=98.08s)]
*  Springfield, Ohio is facing a fourth day of threats over the claims that have forced a college, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=102.72s)]
*  hospitals, and schools to lock down. Meanwhile, Springfield police say they [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=108.08s)]
*  received two calls about Proud Boys marching through the city. Here's how Donald Trump [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=113.44s)]
*  responded to the controversy over Haitians, who I want to note are in the U.S. legally. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=118.88s)]
*  I don't know what happened with the threats. I know that it's been taken over by illegal migrants, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  and that's a terrible thing that happened. Springfield was this beautiful town, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=131.2s)]
*  and now they're going through hell. Here with me now is Republican Vice [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=135.28s)]
*  Presidential nominee JD Vance, who represents Ohio in the U.S. Senate. Thank you for being here, sir. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=138.95999999999998s)]
*  So the mayor of Springfield, Ohio, Rob Rue, said, quote, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=145.04s)]
*  all these federal politicians that have negatively spun our city, they need to know they're hurting [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=148.88s)]
*  our city, and it was their words that did it. Before Donald Trump talked about eating dogs and [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=154.16s)]
*  cats on a debate stage, it was you, Senator, who first elevated this baseless rumor. These are your [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=160.64s)]
*  constituents. So why are you putting them at risk by continuing to spread claims about Haitian [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=166.8s)]
*  immigrants despite officials in your state saying that there's no evidence and pleading for you to [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=173.6s)]
*  stop? Well, Dana, first of all, what's putting the residents of Springfield at risk, which was a town [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=179.44s)]
*  completely ignored by the American media until Donald Trump and I started surfacing some of [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=184.72s)]
*  these concerns, is that they can't afford housing, they can't afford health care. The schools have [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=189.28s)]
*  been overwhelmed, the hospitals have been over... I wonder whose fault that is in the state of Ohio. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=194.4s)]
*  I wonder who's at fault in the red state of Ohio, plus 35 for Governor Mike DeWine, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=200.96s)]
*  Republican Governor Mike DeWine, the state that you were a senator of as a Republican, the state [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=208.16s)]
*  that went to Donald Trump by plus 10 points. I wonder who is at fault for Springfield, Ohio, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=213.2s)]
*  being in an absolute state of disrepair. It must be the Haitian migrants or the Democratic Party. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=222.8s)]
*  What is going on? You are the senator from the state of Ohio, you idiot. Why are you like Ohio's [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=231.92s)]
*  dog? It sucks. It is the worst state of all time. It is in a dire state of disrepair. Nothing works [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=241.04s)]
*  there. I hate it. I hate it so much. Oh wait, I'm the senator from that state. I am directly [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=249.6s)]
*  responsible for its sucking dog. I'm so stupid for saying the state that I'm a senator of [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=259.36s)]
*  actually sucks because it's my fault that it sucks because I don't do anything to help them. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=267.84000000000003s)]
*  But they're so stupid they voted for me because they're stupid. They're stupid in Ohio. That's [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=275.68s)]
*  why they voted for me. I'm stupid and I'm a stupid guy and I hate the people of Ohio. That's basically [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=281.2s)]
*  what you said. Okay. Thank you, Senator Jedidiah Donaldson Vance, senator from Ohio. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=288.72s)]
*  Overwhelmed and they're overwhelmed because Kamala Harris allowed 20,000 Haitian migrants to get [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=299.12s)]
*  dropped into a small Ohio town of about 40,000 people and it's completely overwhelmed the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=304.8s)]
*  services. Now you ask why have I talked about some of the things that I've been talking about. Let [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=309.84000000000003s)]
*  me just say this. My constituents have brought approximately a dozen separate concerns to me. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=314.08s)]
*  Ten of them are verifiable and confirmable and a couple of them I talk about because my constituents [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=320.32s)]
*  are telling me firsthand that they're seeing these things. So I have two options, Dana. I [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=326.15999999999997s)]
*  could ignore them, which is what the American media has done for years to this community, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=331.59999999999997s)]
*  or I can actually talk about what people are telling me. And of course, many of the things [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=336.24s)]
*  that the media says are completely baseless have since been confirmed. For example, I was told, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=340.48s)]
*  Dana, by the American media that it was baseless. Yeah, also it is a lie. Their tax revenue literally [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=347.12s)]
*  increased by 33% year over year since the Haitians moved in the town because now they have active [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=353.12s)]
*  workers in the town for all of the jobs that needed workers. So he's such a piece of- [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=359.52000000000004s)]
*  Baseless that migrants were capturing the geese from the local park pond and eating them. And [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=364.24s)]
*  yet there are 911 calls from- Yeah, by the way, like honestly, Daily Callers, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=370.24s)]
*  former Daily Caller news anchor, Kaitlyn, whatever her name is, actually ripped JD Vance such a high, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=376.88s)]
*  such a good one in the spin room in the immediate aftermath of the debate where she was like, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=384.72s)]
*  okay, constituents will call you and tell you Bigfoot is real. Are you going to sit here and [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=389.76s)]
*  tell us Bigfoot is real in Ohio? That was such a good take from Kaitlyn Collins, who used to work [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=394.24s)]
*  for the Daily Caller, which is so- It's Tucker Carlson's Daily Wire, okay? Daily Wire has been [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=404.72s)]
*  Shapiro's operation. Tucker Carlson's operation was the Daily Caller. Kaitlyn Collins, who is now at [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=411.28000000000003s)]
*  CNN, used to work there. The Daily Caller is so insane that they used to make compilations of [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=418.72s)]
*  people running over protesters in pickup trucks. That is the website that she worked for, okay? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=426.32000000000005s)]
*  That is the website that she worked for before working at CNN. The Daily Caller had to delete [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=434.48s)]
*  all of their running over protesters compilations after a Nazi ran over a counter-protester by the [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=439.92s)]
*  name of Heather Heyer in Charlottesville. They had to delete those videos because they realized, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=448.8s)]
*  uh-oh, we're kind of celebrating, you know, people, people, we're kind of celebrating domestic [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=455.76s)]
*  terrorism. Many people forgot. I have not, because I have that kind of autism in my head. Anyway, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=461.36s)]
*  let's get back to JD in Vance. Well before this ever became a viral sensation of people complaining [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=468.47999999999996s)]
*  about that exact thing happening. So my attitude is listen to my constituents. Sometimes they're [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=474.4s)]
*  going to say things that people don't like, but they're saying things that people don't like [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=480.0s)]
*  because their town has been overwhelmed and it's my job to try to fight for them and to protect them. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=484.15999999999997s)]
*  Kamala Harris opened the border and now these people are suffering. That's what I'm focused on, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=489.44s)]
*  DeLa. Senator, I have to go through several things that you just said. First of all, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=494.48s)]
*  the Clark County Sheriff and the Ohio Department of Natural Resources reviewed 11 months of 9-1-1 [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=498.24s)]
*  calls. They only identified two instances of people alleging Haitians were taking geese out [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=504.16s)]
*  of parks. They found zero evidence to substantiate those claims. Also other evidence that you have [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=510.48s)]
*  talked about, even you've retweeted alleged evidence. Yeah, by the way, the Haitians are [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=517.6s)]
*  his constituents as well. Okay, I need you to understand something. He is a senator in the [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=523.36s)]
*  state of Ohio. Those Haitians are refugees with temporary protected status. Okay, they have [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=530.88s)]
*  paperwork. They are not illegal immigrants. That is a lie. Even if they were, it wouldn't matter [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=539.6800000000001s)]
*  because they're still human beings, but they're not even illegal. Okay, they literally are tax [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=547.5200000000001s)]
*  paying legal documented immigrants. Okay. Now, technically they can't vote for him, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=554.32s)]
*  but it doesn't change the reality that there's still his constituents. Children can't vote. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=560.6400000000001s)]
*  Do you think children are not JD Vance's constituents? Is JD Vance going around? Okay, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=565.2800000000001s)]
*  well maybe he is going around saying that children should be able to vote or at least their parents [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=571.44s)]
*  should be able to vote. And also he probably wants them to get to work anyway. But like, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=575.6s)]
*  he would never openly say that children are not my constituents. Actually, he might because he's [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=579.84s)]
*  really bad at politics. And as a person who's really bad at politics, I could totally see [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=585.44s)]
*  him saying that with a straight face. Anyway, our unsourced social media videos from a different [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=590.48s)]
*  city, apparently no connection to Haitians. And this is from a conservative activist who offered [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=597.0400000000001s)]
*  a $5,000 reward for such things. And then going just back to the schools and the hospitals and [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=603.04s)]
*  so forth being overwhelmed. Nobody is disputing that the town of Springfield, Ohio needs help. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=609.76s)]
*  But you're not just a bystander. You're the Senator from Ohio. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=618.7199999999999s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you. Oh my God. Thank you, Dana Fash. Exactly. You're the Senator of Ohio, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=623.52s)]
*  the state that you just said is and needs desperate help. He's so stupid. How is he so bad? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=632.0799999999999s)]
*  It actually blows my mind how bad he is. You aren't Trump, little bro. Only Trump gets to go [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=639.68s)]
*  and visit these places and be like, you people are dirty and disgusting. And they go, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=645.6s)]
*  hell yes, brother. You're so right. We are dirty and disgusting. You don't get to do that. You [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=649.68s)]
*  don't have that charisma. Instead of saying things that are wrong and actually causing the hospitals, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=654.0799999999999s)]
*  the schools, the government buildings to be evacuated because of threats, because of the [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=659.6s)]
*  cats and dogs thing. Why not actually be constructive and helping to better integrate [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=664.24s)]
*  them into the community? Because there are a lot of employers there who say that the Haitian workers [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=671.2s)]
*  are helping fill jobs that they need desperately filled. Dana, first of all, let me just respond [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=676.32s)]
*  to a couple of things that you said. But I want to start with something you said, which I think is [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=681.76s)]
*  frankly disgusting and is more appropriate for a democratic propagandist than it is for an American [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=685.52s)]
*  journalist. There is no, y'all that was to a couple of things that you said, but I want to start with [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=690.64s)]
*  something you said, which I think is frankly disgusting and is more appropriate for a democratic [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=696.48s)]
*  propagandist than it is for. There is nothing that I have said that has led to threats against these [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=700.88s)]
*  hospitals, these hospitals, the threats and so forth. It's disgusting. The violence is disgusting. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=706.96s)]
*  We condemn it. We condemn all violence. He always looks like a German boy whose lollipop fell on the [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=712.88s)]

*  like typical like 60s, 70s like German child look to him. Mine lolly! Oh my god! Mine lolly poppin'! [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=727.92s)]
*  Doesn't he look like that? I'm daddy's little boy! I'm daddy's little boy! How could this have [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=740.4000000000001s)]
*  happened to me? Mine lolly! It is disgusting! Yeah, that's him. Especially without the beard. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=747.12s)]
*  On the debate stage said that cats and dogs were being eaten. You asked a question, Dana, and I'm [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=756.5600000000001s)]
*  going to go ahead and answer. It's funny because it's like, it's funny because like the question is [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=762.0s)]
*  so simple. It's like zero threats are happening in the city of Springfield. You lie about Haitians [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=766.72s)]
*  overtaking the city of Springfield and eating cats and dogs. Then the threats start coming in. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=773.28s)]
*  Springfield city officials say these threats are happening because the Republicans have placed an [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=778.5600000000001s)]
*  inappropriate amount of attention on our city by claiming that Haitians are doing all this. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=783.6800000000001s)]
*  Everybody knows what's going on and he's like, how dare you? You are disgusting. You are disgusting [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=788.72s)]
*  for saying the truth. Why would you say the truth directly to my face? I am a little boy [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=794.48s)]
*  whose lolly has fallen on the ground and is covered with ants and here you are being disgusting about [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=800.3199999999999s)]
*  this. Okay? Give me a new lolly now! That's right. After that they were... What we have said is that [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=806.48s)]
*  this town has suffered terribly under the policies of Kamala Harris. Now, you just accused me of [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=813.92s)]
*  inciting violence against the community when all that I've done is surface the complaints of my [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=821.28s)]
*  constituents. Yeah, Dana should ask, like, don't you think the Haitians are also your constituents? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=827.52s)]
*  Like they're taxpayers, they're on TPS, they're working in the factories. Like, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=832.4s)]
*  just ask him that question. He's going to say no, but it's good to have that on the record. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=837.68s)]
*  People who are suffering because of Kamala Harris's policies. Are we not allowed to talk about these [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=842.0s)]
*  problems because some psychopaths are threatening violence? We can condemn the violence on the one [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=847.68s)]
*  hand, but also talk about the terrible consequences of Kamala Harris's open border on the other hand. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=853.12s)]
*  Now, let me just fact check a couple of other things that you said, Dana, because it's important. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=859.1999999999999s)]
*  You said that all of these migrants are in the country legally. They're in the country through [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=863.3599999999999s)]
*  what's called temporary protective status. That is when Kamala Harris waved a magic amnesty wand. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=868.4799999999999s)]
*  Oh, so he does know that they're illegal. Okay. Wait, no, he wait, I'm sorry. You know, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=874.8s)]
*  Trump did that too, right? Like to the Venezuelans specifically. So it's kind of weird that he's like [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=881.12s)]
*  Trump, Donald Trump is so funny because he directly caused this massive influx of Venezuelans [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=888.9599999999999s)]
*  escaping Venezuela by accelerating the sanctions regime on Venezuela with that purpose, by the way, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=895.8399999999999s)]
*  they wanted to make the economy scream and they did. So people ran away. And then [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=903.52s)]
*  Donald Trump also offered the Venezuelan migrants temporary protective status. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=910.96s)]
*  The reason for why he did that is because that's what every American government has done. It's a [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=915.84s)]
*  classic state department play. You get, you try to destroy a country and the migrants that escape [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=920.8s)]
*  that country, you offer them TPS. We did it with the Cubans with the hopes that like we have an [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=928.56s)]
*  outsized anti whatever country that is population living here so that inevitably we can use that [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=932.9599999999999s)]
*  population here. Well, it's good for cheap labor too, but it's also specifically so that we can [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=939.8399999999999s)]
*  use those people that are now here against whichever country that we want to even further. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=945.5999999999999s)]
*  Right? Like if you ask most Cuban voters what to do with Cuba, they will say unhinged like [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=950.56s)]
*  and destroy it, nuke the island and give it to us afterwards. You don't have to look any further [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=957.12s)]
*  than the Miami, the mayor of Miami who is of Cuban descent, who literally said this by the way. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=962.0s)]
*  Okay. So that's what they did with the TPS for the Venezuelan migrants because they were like, well, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=969.4399999999999s)]
*  they're leaving the country. They hate Maduro. We can use these guys against Venezuela down the line, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=974.4s)]
*  except now, except now you're like, they're all rapists, drug dealer, gangsters who are taking [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=979.68s)]
*  over the apartment complexes. These Venezuelans that we gave temporary protective status to [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=985.52s)]
*  that we literally like forced out of Venezuela with our insane sanctions. Those guys are now [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=991.1999999999999s)]
*  the rapists that we brought into the country and gave TPS to. It doesn't make any sense. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=997.92s)]
*  And it's not supposed to. Those guys are like the Republicans are pieces of and they're also now [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1003.68s)]
*  they're illegal even though we gave them TPS. Taking people and giving them legal status. That [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1008.48s)]
*  is not a, that is not to say that they're here legally. That is a terrible indictment of her [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1014.64s)]
*  amnesty policies that have further opened the border and further cause terrible migration into [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1020.3199999999999s)]
*  this country. You might not agree with the policy and obviously you don't, which is totally [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1026.0s)]
*  fair and legitimate. There are policy disagreements all the time, but the fact is it is the law because [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1031.2s)]
*  President Biden and Vice President Harris are, but I don't want to get, I don't want to frankly go [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1038.6399999999999s)]
*  down this conversation about policy because no. You made a point. You don't, I agree you don't [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1044.24s)]
*  want to talk about policy. No, what I want to talk about, what I want to talk about. Instead of about [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1052.32s)]
*  the fact Senator, it was your distraction. You were the one who started talking about amnesty at a mass level. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1057.1200000000001s)]
*  You were the one who brought this, you didn't set it to 60 million people. And I talked about it because [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1065.84s)]
*  you were ignoring this community. My constituents talked about it. It is my responsibility to surface their [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1071.44s)]
*  Oh my God. He's like, yeah, I made it up, dude. Sorry. Like I made it up. He straight up said, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1077.52s)]
*  and this is Sam Stein earlier in the interview, if I have to create stories so that the American [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1084.88s)]
*  media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that's what I'm going to do. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1089.68s)]
*  Their concerns when the American media. Have you been to Springfield? Dana, I've been to Springfield [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1093.92s)]
*  probably a hundred times in my life. How about recently? I've taken my children to get ice cream at [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1098.56s)]
*  Young's Jersey Dairy. Have you heard recently since you've gotten these calls? Have I been in the last [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1103.44s)]
*  four days? No, I haven't been in the last four days, but I've talked to a lot of people in Springfield, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1108.48s)]
*  Dana, and they're telling me this stuff is happening. Dana, would you like to ask me questions and then [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1113.36s)]
*  let me answer them or would you like to debate me on these topics? I noticed that when you had Kamala [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1118.6399999999999s)]
*  Harris and Tim Waltz, you gave them multiple choice answers. And no one is even trying to [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1124.56s)]
*  assassinate Biden and Kamala. This man is a defense contractor. Okay, let's put the CIA in there too. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1130.1599999999999s)]
*  And Barack Obama, he might delete it. I hope they do. I hope he does. That'd be really cool if he did. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1136.3999999999999s)]
*  To the questions that you asked and you allowed them to answer the questions. I'm happy to be [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1142.1599999999999s)]
*  here to talk about policy, but if you're going to interrupt me every single time that I open my mouth, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1147.04s)]
*  then why am I even doing this? So please ask a question. Yeah, JD doesn't understand the Trump [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1152.0s)]
*  playbook. You don't legitimize insane conspiracies by admitting they're false. You have to keep [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1157.04s)]
*  pretending they're true. Wait, did he delete it? Shut up. Did he actually delete it? You're lying. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1160.32s)]
*  He didn't delete it. You guys you baited me. Why would you debate me at the top of the hour when [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1165.84s)]
*  there's a three minute ad break coming for you? That's the real debate. Because at the top of the [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1169.68s)]

*  enough to let me answer it. Yes, I am. And I think that if Kamala Harris and Tim Walls were making [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1186.48s)]
*  unsubstantiated claims that has undertones about people eating dogs and cats, I would and they [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1195.1200000000001s)]
*  people in the comments saying this will be used against you. I don't give a also I'm joking. You [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1202.64s)]

*  They didn't answer the questions about that. Then I would have similar interactions with them. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1211.28s)]
*  As you know, I, I am very grateful that you come on the show as I am for other Republicans. But [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1217.12s)]
*  this is something that I you're hearing from constituents. I did a lot of reporting. I talked [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1223.9199999999998s)]
*  to people in and they're really worried about these claims, the policies. Yes, I am. I am agreeing [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1227.9199999999998s)]
*  with you that what I heard is that there is concern that these migrants, there's a lot of [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1235.28s)]
*  them and the integration isn't being done fast enough and well enough. Why would you cave on [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1240.8s)]
*  that? Aiden, that's so dumb. God, Dana, fast. You suck. Clark, who is the 11 year old boy who was [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1246.16s)]
*  in Springfield last year, it was a car accident involving a Haitian immigrant. You said that he [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1254.8799999999999s)]
*  was his father said that's not true. It was an accident. Here's what he said to you. Politicians [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1260.32s)]
*  Bernie Moreno, Chip Roy, JD Vance and Donald Trump. They have spoken my son's name and used his death [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1267.6799999999998s)]
*  for political gain. This needs to stop now. They are not allowed nor have they ever been allowed [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1275.28s)]
*  to mention Aiden Clark from Springfield, Ohio. I will listen to them one more time to hear their [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1281.52s)]
*  apologies. Senator, he's asking for you to apologize. Will you? Dana, first of all, my heart [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1286.16s)]

*  expressed a preference for politicians to not bring their son's name up. I wish them all the [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1294.96s)]
*  best. I can't believe what kind of a tragedy they've experienced, but I'm still going to keep on [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1300.96s)]
*  talking about what the migrants have done. Dude, he's that's crazy. That dude called you out by [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1305.6000000000001s)]

*  a car accident. Okay. You used his child's death to continue lying about Haitians that are also [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1319.12s)]
*  your constituents, but you don't care about them because they're black. Okay. That is a demonic [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1326.72s)]
*  way to approach the subject matter. He's like, yeah, I don't give a fuck about the debt. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1331.28s)]
*  I don't give a fuck about that dad, bro. RIP to your son, but I'm going to keep using it to like, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1335.52s)]

*  fans is not bright, but he's ex military, which I think in Trump's mind is important. Sounds like a [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1346.64s)]
*  plan in motion. First of all, JD Vance is a Marine. Okay. And if you know anything about the American [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1350.3200000000002s)]
*  military, putting a former Marine in a position of power is probably the dumbest thing you can do. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1357.92s)]
*  Okay. And you don't have to look any further than how stupid this idea was. Just look at this [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1365.52s)]
*  interview. He is probably right outside of frame looking for his crayons, his emotional support [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1371.44s)]
*  crayons to chew on as Dana Bash is chewing his ass. Okay. What Kamala Harris's open border has [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1379.36s)]
*  done to Springfield, Ohio. And Dana, I think this illustrates the entire contrast between how we're [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1386.24s)]
*  trying to go about this debate and how a lot of the Democrats are trying to go about this debate. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1392.24s)]
*  They're talking about 12 proud boys marching in Springfield, Ohio. They're talking about the, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1396.64s)]
*  the, the frankly fake debunkings of a lot of these stories that are out there. I'm talking to my [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1402.16s)]
*  constituents and I'm hearing terrible things about what's going on in Springfield and Kamala Harris's [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1408.24s)]
*  open border policies have caused these problems. The hospitals are overwhelmed, Dana. The schools [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1414.0s)]
*  are overwhelmed. The local services are completely overwhelmed. You have people who can't afford [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1420.0s)]
*  housing. Homelessness has gone up. They're up by 81% because of what Kamala Harris has allowed to [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1425.76s)]
*  happen to this small community. I'm going to keep on talking about that. Now, of course we can [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1431.92s)]
*  criticize violence. We can also still talk about the problems that are happening. He says violence, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1437.04s)]
*  bro. It was a car. It was a car accident. Why does he keep repeating her name every other sentence? [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1443.04s)]
*  Because he's trying to do the media training. Like that's it. In Springfield and we should be [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1448.4s)]
*  able to do both those things simultaneously, Dana. Just once and for all, you again started this in [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1454.72s)]
*  part by saying that at which Donald Trump repeated on the debate stage that and he didn't say anything [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1462.0s)]
*  about the policies that you're talking about. He just said Haitians are eating dogs and cats. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1467.76s)]
*  Can you affirmatively say now that that is a rumor that has no base basis with evidence? [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1472.64s)]
*  Dana, the evidence is the firsthand account of my constituents who are telling me that this [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1480.8000000000002s)]
*  happened. And by the way, I've been trying to talk about the problems in Springfield for months [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1485.8400000000001s)]
*  and the American media ignored it. There was a congressional hearing just last week of angel moms [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1490.8000000000002s)]
*  who lost children because Kamala Harris let migrants into this country who then their children. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1495.92s)]
*  He sounds like a bot, dude. I think he's repeated it like what five times in the last three minutes. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1502.4s)]
*  That's weird. He sounds like a robot. The media totally ignored this stuff until Donald Trump and [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1507.76s)]
*  I started talking about cat memes. If I have to create stories so that the American media [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1512.96s)]
*  actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that's what I'm going to do, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1520.24s)]
*  Dana, because you guys are completely letting Kamala Harris coast. You had one interview with [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1524.8799999999999s)]
*  her. You talk about pushing back against me, Dana. You didn't push back against the fact that she [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1530.32s)]
*  cast the deciding vote on the inflation reduction act, which is why a lot of Americans can't afford [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1535.04s)]
*  food and housing. You just said that you're creating a story policy. Sorry, you just said [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1540.0s)]
*  that you're creating the story. What's that, Dana? You just said that this is a story that you. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1544.3999999999999s)]
*  Let's run it back. That he alludes to it multiple times throughout the interview, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1548.3999999999999s)]
*  but that right there, cinema. Dana, my lolly, my lolly is on the ground. Dana, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1554.8799999999999s)]
*  why won't you be nice to me? My lolly, Dana, answer my lolly. Because you guys are completely [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1562.72s)]
*  letting Kamala Harris store our talk for children and because Kamala Harris let migrants into this [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1571.52s)]
*  country who then their children, the American media totally ignored this stuff until Donald [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1576.8s)]
*  Trump and I started talking about cat memes. If I have to create stories so that the American [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1582.0s)]
*  media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that's what I'm going [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1589.28s)]
*  to do, Dana, because you guys are completely letting Kamala Harris coast. You had one interview [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1593.84s)]
*  with her. You talk about pushing back against me, Dana. You didn't push back against the fact that [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1599.6s)]

*  bro, bro, bro, bro, bro. He went, he went on the inflation reduction act, which is why a lot of [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1628.56s)]
*  Americans can't afford food and housing. You just said that you're creating a story policy. Sorry, [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1634.16s)]
*  you just said that you're creating the story. What's that data? You just said that this is a story [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1639.2s)]
*  that you created. So, so the eating dog thing is not, we are creating, we are Dana. It comes from [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1643.1200000000001s)]
*  firsthand accounts from my constituents. I say that we're creating a story, meaning we're creating [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1650.8000000000002s)]
*  the American media focusing on it. I didn't create 20. A lot of people don't know what that noise is. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1655.28s)]
*  Maybe many of you do cause it's 30, this 30 plus in here, but like, we used to hear that. Okay. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1660.8799999999999s)]
*  A thousand illegal migrants coming into Springfield. Thanks to Kamala Harris's policies. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1666.8799999999999s)]
*  Her policies did that. Don't let them get away with that. Ask him again. Why did you say you [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1671.9199999999998s)]
*  created stories? You just admitted that you created these stories. But yes, we created the [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1676.48s)]
*  actual focus that allowed the American media to talk about this story and the suffering caused [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1682.72s)]
*  by Kamala Harris's policies. Do you, do you condemn the Proud Boys, even if it's just 12, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1687.92s)]
*  even if it's just one marching in Springfield? Dana, I condemn all white supremacists. I'm [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1692.88s)]
*  obviously not, I'm married to a non-white person. I don't like these people, but I think that we have [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1697.68s)]
*  to keep our focus not on 12 marchers going down the street, but on the fact that thousands of [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1703.92s)]
*  residents have had their lives destroyed by Kamala Harris's policy. I find that- Bro, you can say [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1710.0800000000002s)]
*  Kamala Harris's policy all day, every day. That right there, that right there is so, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1715.92s)]
*  it's so jover, dude. It's so jover. This very unusual Dana, that the American media is more [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1722.8000000000002s)]
*  interested in a bunch of losers marching down the street than they are in the fact that Kamala Harris [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1729.2s)]
*  has made these people's lives worse. I'm not talking about 12 Proud Boys. I'm talking about [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1734.64s)]
*  40,000 residents, 40,000 constituents of mine, many of whom can't afford housing and food [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1739.44s)]
*  because of Kamala Harris's open border. That is what I want to focus the media's attention on. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1745.6s)]
*  We're going to keep on doing it because I think the American people deserve a government that [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1750.7199999999998s)]
*  puts their interests first. Can I make just one more final point about this, Dana? Yes, please. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1755.12s)]
*  You've heard a lot of the media focusing on every possible distraction from the story in [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1759.28s)]
*  Springfield. You've heard them focus on these Proud Boys marchers. You've heard just in this [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1765.52s)]
*  interview, Dana, the suggestion that because some psychopath is calling it a bomb threat, [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1770.56s)]
*  somehow we have to then ignore 40,000 Springfieldians who are having their lives [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1776.48s)]
*  worsened by Kamala Harris's policies. I actually love to have this conversation right now live on [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1781.44s)]
*  air. What is the implication when you say you calling out these problems has caused a threat? [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1786.8799999999999s)]
*  You accused me of causing a threat. Doesn't that mean you should shut up about the residents of [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1793.52s)]
*  Springfield? Don't you realize you're engaged in basic propaganda? Look at this. Look, these people [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1799.12s)]
*  are just comically evil, says Nate Hockman, who you might not know his name, but I do because [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1804.32s)]
*  political autism. Nate Hockman is the Nazi staffer on the Ronda Santis campaign who was fired for [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1811.28s)]
*  being a Nazi. Now, before people say, well, he's Jewish. Yes, he is. He also is a Nazi. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1820.7199999999998s)]
*  Nate Hockman is the Nazi staffer on the Ronda Santis campaign that made the campaign video [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1828.3200000000002s)]
*  where he put a Nazi image on it. This one in particular, the black sun. I'm not making any [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1835.76s)]
*  emotional argument here. It's just kind of a matter of fact, this guy's a Nazi weirdo. Given this, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1842.8s)]
*  this, this was the black sun imagery that the Nazi staffer, Nate Hockman put on the Ronda Santis, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1847.76s)]
*  on the Ronda Santis promo video. Okay. Cassie Pritchard responses, it's a fender bender, dude. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1857.2800000000002s)]

*  society without causing deaths. You are subhuman. They're saying it is warranted over a fender bender [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1877.0400000000002s)]
*  story that the New York Post chose to cover. I believe it was Caroline, a friend of the show, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1884.16s)]
*  who posted that there's six million car accidents that occur in the United States. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1890.64s)]
*  Okay. Is the New York Post covering all of them? Of course not. Why did the New York Post choose [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1895.1200000000001s)]
*  to cover this minor fender bender that did not cause any injuries that happened to be in Springfield, [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1900.0800000000002s)]
*  Ohio? Do we know why the New York Post chose to cover this? Because Springfield, Ohio was not in [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1908.24s)]
*  New York. Why did New York Post cover it? It's because they're... and they also want to incite a [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1914.0s)]
*  race riot. That's the reason. Okay. And to silence the concerns of American citizens, please. I was [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1918.88s)]

*  funniest thing to say about Ohio too. Because like, famously, the Midwest is... I don't know how this [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1940.96s)]
*  is even possible because Florida and California exist, but famously the Midwest is one of some of [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1948.72s)]
*  the worst states for car accidents, which is why it makes it even funnier that they're like, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1953.92s)]
*  oh, these goddamn Haitians are doing car accidents. Like, they're accusing Haitian people of duck [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1958.96s)]

*  Okay. These are things that you do. Okay. If it was even true, that would mean that they have [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=1973.44s)]

*  dogs and cats. Like, I'm telling you, it's insane. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=2068.56s)]
*  ...sympathize with the guy and we're going to try to help him out. But he did not accuse me of [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=2072.48s)]
*  inciting a threat. He just didn't. And if we're going to take the firsthand accounts of people [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=2077.2s)]
*  who are on the ground in Springfield, why don't you bring on some of the people on your program [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=2083.2s)]
*  who say that the migrants are eating their pets? You're applying a double standard here. You're [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=2087.2799999999997s)]
*  saying if one person accuses JD Vance, I'm going to take that person's word as the gospel truth. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=2092.3999999999996s)]
*  You have somebody whose name... [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=2098.3199999999997s)]
*  Even if you misrepresent it. If you have another person who's saying they're eating the cats, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=2098.8799999999997s)]
*  you're going to completely ignore them, attack them, silence them, and hurt them. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=2103.92s)]
*  Yeah, because it's fake. What do you mean? Why don't you just like, oh my God, it's fake. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=2107.76s)]
*  He's literally complaining. He's complaining that like, you're not giving credence to a fake story [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=2113.52s)]
*  that I'm trying to present. And instead, doing actual journalism, investigating the matter further, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=2120.48s)]
*  and finding out that it's because I didn't even try hard enough to come up with a good enough lie [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=2128.48s)]
*  is okay, because I'm far too comfortable with the lies that I make up because Republicans are so dumb [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=2133.68s)]
*  that like they believe the dumbest lies at this point. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=2140.48s)]
*  Arrest them. That double standard is why the people don't trust the media and why we're not [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=2144.96s)]
*  talking about public policy 51 days out from presidential election. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=2150.32s)]
*  Okay. If you... [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=2154.56s)]
*  Yeah, if you want to talk about public policy, stop lying, dumbass. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=2156.16s)]
*  Have somebody you want to tell us about who has proved, ate their cat. Of course, [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=2159.68s)]
*  we want to hear that. We certainly have had no evidence that that is actually something [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=2165.12s)]
*  that happened. And I just want to say, I have not accused you of anything. I am quoting the mayor [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=2169.2799999999997s)]
*  who said, after these bomb threats, federal politicians are negatively spinning our city. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=2176.0s)]
*  They need to know they are hurting our city. It was their words that did it. Okay? [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=2182.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm quoting him and it seems to be a cause and effect. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=2189.6000000000004s)]
*  Roll the tape. You just accused me of inciting a bomb threat. There is no evidence of this. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=2195.36s)]
*  I condemn violence and threats of violence. We should be able to do that and also still [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=2202.2400000000002s)]
*  talk about what's going on in Springfield. I'm glad to hear that you condemn it. That [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=2207.76s)]
*  is very important. We had a lot of other issues to get to, but I really hope that you do come back [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=2210.96s)]
*  so we can talk about other issues. Senator, thank you so much. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=2215.6s)]
*  Senator Cable I think one of the funniest aspects of this situation that's like, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=2218.48s)]
*  obviously objectively not funny and is kind of terrifying really is the very real fact [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=2222.08s)]
*  that the guy that recently dropped out of the race and endorsed Donald Trump for president and is [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=2232.88s)]
*  actively trying to get himself off of the voter ballots specifically so that Donald Trump can [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=2239.84s)]
*  win potentially the election had a very public news cycle about how he actually ate a dog. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=2246.2400000000002s)]
*  This is after the news cycle where he carried a bear carcass and left it in the middle of Central [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=2254.48s)]
*  Park and yet another news cycle after how he cut off the head of a beached whale and also put that [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=2260.88s)]
*  on top of his car and trafficked it across state lines. Like it's not the Haitians dog, it's RFK. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=2268.4s)]
*  Like what are we? I mean that's white supremacy right there for the record, okay? Sorry, you can [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=2276.0s)]
*  call me a lib all day, but that is literally white supremacy, okay? That's what this is. When a white [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=2281.44s)]
*  guy does it, you don't give a okay and then you have to fantasize about a black dude doing it [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=2288.4s)]
*  when he isn't doing it. That's how this works. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMW6AynpGVY&t=2293.6s)]
