# ORB - The Peak Anime You CAN'T MISS! | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM)
*  Oh my lord, holy moly. I love it. It's great. That's what I've been watching. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=0.0s)]
*  Ranking of Kings Season 2 has been somewhat mid, dare I say. Ranking of Kings Season 1 was [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=8.24s)]
*  incredible, spectacular, very well drawn. Let me tell you, I watched Orb and my god, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=15.6s)]
*  Gart was right. Not sure if Gart actually, if the Trash Taste podcast has come out yet [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=28.72s)]
*  that I did with the Trash Taste boys, I don't know when it's supposed to come out, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=37.68s)]
*  but I watched Orb. Oh my lord. What a it's peak. It's peak. I'll say it. It's peak. It's peak. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=41.04s)]
*  It's peak. It's peak. It's peak. It's peak. It's peak. It's on Netflix. It's peak. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  It's peak. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=51.84s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  It's peak. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=81.84s)]
*  It's peak. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=104.4s)]
*  Black History Month and you're not wearing a durag? True. I have not watched Severance [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=111.84s)]
*  Season 2 yet, but I really liked it obviously when I watched Season 1. And it is, it gets so good. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=120.16s)]
*  As a flat earther, I'm boycotting. Trust its peak. Okay. That's all I'm saying. It's so good. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=127.12s)]
*  It's definitely adult. It's definitely adult. It's definitely adult anime, but it is so good. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=134.0s)]
*  Oh my lord. Holy moly. I, I love it. It's great. That's what I've been watching. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=140.0s)]
*  Ranking of Kings Season 2 has been somewhat mid, dare I say. Ranking of Kings Season 1 was [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=148.16s)]
*  incredible, spectacular, very well drawn. Every episode has multiple different interesting plot [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=155.6s)]
*  points, things changing. Characters are not truly good or truly bad. Second season, not so much. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=162.8s)]
*  Ranking of Kings Second Season has been kind of slow and weirded out or not weirded out, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=170.32000000000002s)]
*  but it like slowed down. Episodes kind of give off filler a little bit. And it's not, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=177.12s)]
*  which is why I was like, you know what? I need, I need to dive into orb head first. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=183.84s)]
*  Still watching Mashal, Mashal season two and is, is whatever I'm about to finish season two. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=188.16s)]
*  It's it's fine. But orb, Oh my God, totally separate level of anime. So [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=194.16s)]
*  highly recommend it. Great, great anime in general. And that's it. Or peak intro or is, is, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=202.0s)]
*  is just peak everything. So that's neither here nor there. We got that. What would you compare [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=210.72s)]
*  orb to? I would compare it to, what's the Viking anime that I'm forgetting the name of now? Jesus [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=217.92s)]
*  Christ. I'm watching soccer mother days as well. It's great Vinland Saga. It's like Vinland Saga [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=226.0s)]
*  season two. Yeah. Vinland Saga, but even better anyway. Did you ever finish delicious in dungeon [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=230.23999999999998s)]
*  Meshia? Yes, I did. What is this fire song? Oh, this, the opening theme. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=238.32000000000002s)]
*  It is a banger intro. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=249.12s)]
*  You need to watch free run. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=259.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=268.08s)]
*  Anyway, started watching solo leveling. It's all right so far. I'm sorry, but the fit is bad today. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=291.76s)]
*  Bro, let me put some shit on. Okay. Let me, let me put some shit on for once. I think the fit would [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=298.08s)]
*  have been better if I wore a white shirt instead of a green one, but I think it's a decent fit [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=303.28s)]
*  regardless. All right. I need to, I need to do some, some different stuff every now and then. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=307.35999999999996s)]
*  Oh my God. Everyone's going squid games, squid games, squid games, Andy. Yes. Yes. Squid games [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=316.56s)]
*  as fit. I know squid games as fit. All right. But yeah, personal, personal news wise, aside from that, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=321.92s)]
*  had a really productive conversation this morning with a friend. We have some crazy content coming [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=328.48s)]
*  out. Okay. Crazy, crazy content coming out this year in autumn. Okay. There is going to be some [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=333.76s)]
*  really cool stuff that I'm going to be doing. Kids going international. You already know. So [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=343.36s)]
*  that's, that's exciting as well. Can't wear a Japanese inspired fit every day. Sometimes you [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=349.92s)]
*  need to pay respect to the Balkans. Exactly. That's what I'm talking about. Yeah. I'll watch [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=354.47999999999996s)]
*  the PlayStation state of play today. But how do you decide what glass shape was best for you? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=357.68s)]
*  I'm struggling. You just go to the store and you try them on, but I've always, I feel like my, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=364.0s)]
*  I don't have a lot of like square glasses. I've, I've always had circular frames in general. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=372.48s)]
*  That's what works with my face. I think. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jymUtW4uUM&t=380.08s)]
