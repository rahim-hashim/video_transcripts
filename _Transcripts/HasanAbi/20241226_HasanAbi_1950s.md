# Gaza Tension: Ongoing Incidents | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [December 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro)
*  Claiming that this is simply a mistake is not correct. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=0.0s)]
*  Claiming that this is simply a mistake and not a [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=4.5s)]
*  **** deliberate campaign of **** cleansing, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=7.84s)]
*  okay, is still manufacturing consent to make it seem as though [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=10.64s)]
*  Israel is just simply applying artificial intelligence in its targeting systems. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=14.94s)]
*  There's also additional attacks that Russia engaged on Ukraine [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=19.72s)]
*  on Christmas Day with a wave of airstrikes as well. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=29.82s)]
*  This morning, Ukraine's still reeling from a massive Christmas Day drone and missile attack [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=32.06s)]
*  by Russian forces. At least six people **** in strikes like this in Kharkiv, officials say. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=37.02s)]
*  While in the capital, thousands of families spending Christmas seeking safety in the subway. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=42.86s)]
*  It's scary to stay at home, so we came to the shelter, says this mom. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=49.900000000000006s)]
*  Russia is once again targeting the energy grid, Ukraine says, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=53.74s)]
*  leaving half a million people without power in the depths of winter. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=57.82s)]
*  President Zelensky saying Putin deliberately chose Christmas for an attack. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=62.14s)]
*  What could be more inhumane and President Biden calling the attack outrageous, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=66.46000000000001s)]
*  vowing to surge US weapons to Ukrainian forces. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=71.26s)]
*  But nearly three years into this grinding war, Ukraine is losing ground in the East [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=74.78s)]
*  and struggling to hold territory it captured inside Russia, where Putin's forces are supported [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=80.22s)]
*  by thousands of troops from North Korea. Also bracing to see if Donald Trump will try to end [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=85.1s)]
*  the war and on what terms. Gotta be a deal. Too many people being ****. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=91.1s)]
*  But on the front lines in Donetsk, Ukrainian soldiers celebrating Christmas with their [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=96.94s)]
*  comrades and saying they're not giving up. We can't be with our families right now, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=101.41999999999999s)]
*  but we're united by our military family, he says. In his Christmas Day address in Rome, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=107.02s)]
*  the pope appealing for a ceasefire not just in Ukraine, but also in Gaza, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=113.82s)]
*  where Israeli strikes continued over Christmas. And just a few hundred Christians remain in what [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=118.94s)]
*  was once a vibrant community. While Israeli hostage families marking a second Hanukkah [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=125.02s)]
*  without their loved ones. Now, both Israel and Hamas are publicly accusing each other of making [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=130.78s)]
*  new last minute demands, which are slowing down ceasefire negotiations. But there is a sense of [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=136.78s)]
*  urgency here with President-elect Trump saying there will be, quote, hell to pay if there is not [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=141.82s)]
*  a deal in place by the time of his inauguration on January 20th. The who chief was literally in [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=147.66s)]
*  the same airport that Israel bombed in Zana today. I haven't I haven't seen that. Raf Sanchez there [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=154.62s)]
*  for us again this morning in Israel. Raf, thank you. Hey, thank you. But yeah, here it is. Israeli [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=160.14s)]
*  air strikes are hitting Yemen's main international airport in Zana. Strikes across Yemen, including [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=165.26s)]
*  on the international airport in the capital, Sanaa, the head of the World Health Organization, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=170.78s)]
*  Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyes was at the airport about to board a flight when it that is crazy. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=176.14000000000001s)]
*  It really strikes his international airport with who chief inside. At least three people were [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=182.86s)]
*  killed and nearly a dozen injured after Israeli air strikes struck multiple targets control by [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=187.58s)]
*  the moving in Yemen, the international airport in the capital's and not which is like, by the way, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=191.02s)]
*  a crazy way to report that Israel struck the commercial airport, like the civilian commercial [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=194.94s)]
*  airport in Zana as the Houthi movement controlled target in Yemen. Okay. It's like striking JFK and [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=203.66s)]
*  being like controlled by the Brandon regime. Israel struck numerous targets controlled by [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=212.22s)]
*  the Biden regime and the targets are, you know, JFK airport. That's crazy. That's a crazy way to [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=218.62s)]
*  cover that. Anyway, Zana was hit with the head of the World Health Organization. Tedros [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=226.54s)]
*  Adhanom Ghebreyes was boarding a plane. Benjamin Netanyahu said the Israeli strikes would continue [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=233.9s)]
*  until our job is done. It came under Israeli attack. He was not injured. The Israeli military [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=240.3s)]
*  says it has been targeting the Houthis, the rebel group backed by Iran. Houthi rebels say [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=246.3s)]
*  three people were killed in the strikes. If the fighters in Yemen have targeted Israel and ships [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=251.98000000000002s)]
*  in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden in solidarity with. Yeah, the wire broken. The attack is now taking [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=257.74s)]
*  place in broad daylight. Three main goals is a not airport shutdown power plants is not destroyed. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=263.74s)]
*  But data at seaport shut down again, not a normal attack. The opening of a campaign that may be [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=268.22s)]
*  prolonged. And the reason why they're doing that, I suspect is because Yemen has been [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=272.54s)]
*  utilizing weapons that can actually pass through the iron dome and directly strike [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=280.38s)]
*  Tel Aviv, which they have deployed on Tel Aviv numerous times at this point. And that is the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=288.3s)]
*  reason why they're trying to pummel Yemen into submission to stop them from continuing to, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=295.5s)]
*  to stop them from continuing to, to penetrate the iron dome. Palestinians in Gaza. Meanwhile, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=302.06s)]
*  in central Gaza, health officials say five journalists have been killed by an Israeli [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=308.62s)]
*  strike. The strike hit a marked broadcast van outside Al-Ordah hospital in the Nusra refugee [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=313.74s)]
*  camp. Israel also has increased its Israel once again, striking journalists directly. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=320.06s)]
*  Another thing that they started doing is, is claiming that these guys are doing war propaganda [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=328.62s)]
*  when they kill them, which is, which is unique. Anyone that covers Israel's atrocities are now [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=333.42s)]
*  considered to be doing pro Hamas war propaganda, which means that they're journalists and directly [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=340.94s)]
*  saying that they're journalists, not even lying and saying that, Oh, these guys are actually [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=347.26s)]
*  a part of the Al Qassam brigades or a part of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement or anything [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=353.26s)]
*  like that in the past, they would just lie and say that these guys that they're in these [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=358.54s)]
*  journals, they're they are killing because, you know, they would just lie and claim that these [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=363.74s)]
*  guys were like aligned with Palestinian Islamic Jihad or the Al Qassam brigades or whatever. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=369.58000000000004s)]
*  Now they're not even doing that. They're just openly saying we're killing them because of [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=374.22s)]
*  their journalism, because their journalism happens to be, you know, their journalism happens to make [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=378.14s)]
*  Israel look bad, which is an incredible admission in my opinion. Like that is just a, that is [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=385.41999999999996s)]
*  wild. That is open. That's wild. They're openly stating that they are engaging in, you know, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=393.26s)]
*  a war crime. Like they have always actively killed journalists as I've covered time and time again, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=400.21999999999997s)]
*  but in the past they would at least lie about why they were journalists claiming without any real [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=407.1s)]
*  evidence whatsoever that these journalists were actually a part of, you know, enemy combatant [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=412.22s)]
*  movements. Now there's openly saying that they're doing it because of their journalism. And it's [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=415.82s)]
*  interesting. It's different than before. I think that the, the, the cruelty has escalated [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=420.38s)]
*  following the Israeli strikes on Yemen. Defense minister Israel Kot says Israel will hunt down [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=426.7s)]
*  the leaders of the Houthis. We saw precise action by the Israeli air force hitting strategic Houthi [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=430.54s)]
*  targets in Yemen at the airport and at the port Kot says in a video from the Israeli air force's [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=433.82s)]
*  underground command center at the military headquarters in Tel Aviv. As we said, whoever [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=438.62s)]
*  strikes Israel, we will strike them. We will also hunt down all the Houthi leaders, hit them as we [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=442.21999999999997s)]
*  have done elsewhere. He says no one will be able to evade Israel's long arm. One of the journalists [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=445.9s)]
*  had been expecting the birth of his child. The Israeli military said those killed were members [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=451.18s)]
*  of a terrorist cell. Well, let's speak to our news correspondent, Shema Khalil, who is in Jerusalem [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=457.34s)]
*  for us. Hello to you, Shema. Just take us through what we know about these strikes in Yemen. We've [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=463.74s)]
*  seen very dramatic footage from inside Sanaa International Airport of people running in a panic [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=469.5s)]
*  with their luggage in their trolleys, some of them trying to leave the building through a gate, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=476.54s)]
*  others running in different directions. We also saw one from outside the building showing smoke [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=481.98s)]
*  rising. And in the last hour or so, we've also been getting reports that commercial flights are [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=487.66s)]
*  landing in Yemen airport despite reports of damage to the facility. We're getting reports [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=494.21999999999997s)]
*  and an image of an Airbus A320 of the Yemeni Airlines aircraft landing there. We heard from [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=500.78s)]
*  the head of the WHO, the World Health Organization, Tedros Ghebreyesus, who said that he was in the [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=510.85999999999996s)]
*  airport when the strike happened, that he was about to board a plane when the airport was struck, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=516.78s)]
*  and that that resulted in one of the air crew members being injured not very far from where his [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=522.38s)]
*  group were sitting. He said he was okay. We also had confirmation from the Israeli army, the IDF, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=527.74s)]
*  who said that they struck targets used by the Iran-backed group to smuggle Iranian weapons [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=534.86s)]
*  into the region. We know that the airport in Sanaa was targeted, was hit, but also other targets in [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=540.46s)]
*  the Red Sea port city of Hodeida. The Israeli military targeted two power stations, hit two [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=547.5s)]
*  power stations. It's pretty wild. I mean, yeah, when you hit a civilian airport, you are directly [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=553.98s)]
*  putting civilians' lives at harm. This time it included someone from the World Health Organization, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=562.3s)]
*  the leader, the chief of the World Health Organization, which is crazy. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=567.98s)]
*  Key ports as well. This is the second Israeli strike in less than a week on Houthi targets [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=571.74s)]
*  in Yemen, as this month has seen a significant increase of Houthi launched missiles and drones [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=579.58s)]
*  on Israeli territory. One of them injured more than a dozen people when it landed in Tel Aviv [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=587.1s)]
*  on Saturday. The Houthis have vowed time and time again to continue these missile launches, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=593.82s)]
*  to continue attacking Israeli territory until the end of the war in Gaza. And in the past few days, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=600.14s)]
*  we've heard a more determined Israeli leadership. If you will, we've heard the prime minister and [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=606.9399999999999s)]
*  we've heard the Israeli defense minister saying that they're going to go after the Houthi targets [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=612.3s)]
*  in Yemen, but also the Houthi leadership the same way they went after Hamas and Hezbollah leadership [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=618.3s)]
*  as well. Get ready for Israel accusing him of being part of the Houthis for being in Yemen. Yeah, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=623.18s)]
*  I mean, they don't really give a s***. If they end up killing him, they'll say, well, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=628.14s)]
*  shouldn't have been there. What is the purpose of the World Health Organization being in Zana? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=632.3s)]
*  I mean, that is obviously it's an air. It's, I don't know how to explain this to you. Like there [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=636.86s)]
*  is a major health complications happening in Yemen is one of the poorest countries bombed into [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=643.5799999999999s)]
*  oblivion. There was a Saudi backed a side that occurred America back Saudi led until not that [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=648.9399999999999s)]
*  long ago. It's a part of the world. There is an ongoing humanitarian crisis in Yemen as always. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=657.4200000000001s)]
*  So of course the World Health Organization is going to go there. So this is a article that [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=663.26s)]
*  just came out today, earlier today from the New York times that I actually tweeted about as well. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=669.1s)]
*  Part of the article is, I mean, this is New York times engaging in what I call ass covering to [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=674.0600000000001s)]
*  make sure that they can hold onto whatever shred of credibility that they have. Okay. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=679.26s)]
*  And, and they do this every now and then, oftentimes if they ever covered it all, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=685.74s)]
*  they are far too late to the game. The article itself featured some of the plus nine seven two [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=691.2600000000001s)]

*  not been previously reported, even though, even though it had been previously reported. And they [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=704.1400000000001s)]
*  know that it would had been previously reported because they utilize the local call in nine seven [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=709.6600000000001s)]
*  two magazine reporting later in this article itself. In each strike, the order said officers [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=713.42s)]
*  had the authority to risk the 20 civilians. The order, which has not been previously reported, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=717.9799999999999s)]
*  had no precedent in Israeli military history. Mid-ranking officers had never been given so [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=722.4599999999999s)]
*  much leeway to attack so many targets, many of which had lower military significance at such [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=725.9s)]
*  high potential civilian costs. Except it had been previously reported months ahead, months ago by [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=730.2199999999999s)]
*  UL Abraham and his reporting at nine seven two magazine, something that I covered out here as [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=736.3s)]
*  well. We're going to look at the full article in a brief moment and the apology that they engage [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=741.98s)]
*  in within the article itself while also, while also simultaneously still, like I said, burying [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=747.26s)]
*  the lead a little bit. I said, this is insane. There are investigative reporters on covering [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=754.14s)]
*  this horrors months ago. People like myself have also tried to show this to the broader Western [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=757.4200000000001s)]
*  audience. New York times just incredibly late to the story. Sometimes they never even get there, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=761.02s)]
*  truly upsetting. But yeah, this is the article, how Israel weakened civilian protections when [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=764.46s)]
*  bombing Hamas fighters. An investigation by the New York Times has found that Israel in the weeks [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=769.58s)]
*  after Hamas's October seven attacks severely undermined its system of safeguards that make it [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=773.98s)]
*  easier to strike Gaza and use flawed methods to find targets and assess the risk of civilians. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=777.4200000000001s)]
*  Now, what's interesting about this is that even here, even in this article, like the, the ultimate, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=782.38s)]
*  the ultimate goals of Israel, which are genocidal. And this is not just my assessment at this point. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=789.6600000000001s)]
*  This is amnesty international. Okay. This is numerous NGOs, both Israeli NGOs and NGOs that [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=795.98s)]
*  work around the globe. Okay. Hassan, you stink your race. I hope you kill yourself. Okay. This is, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=804.14s)]
*  this is like old school. This is some, some old school ash right here. Respect, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=813.1800000000001s)]
*  respected this chatter for hitting me with some like super old school racism. Like old school [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=818.78s)]
*  isn't like early 2000s era, you know, early 2000s era level of like a schizo posting in here. Good [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=823.26s)]
*  Merry Christmas to this chatter. Just know that even if you felt like you were alone on Christmas [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=833.26s)]
*  or in the aftermath of Christmas, you are nowhere near as sad and as pathetic as this person who [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=839.34s)]
*  will most likely be banned site wide for saying this. Yeah. I've seen the shadow and other people's [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=845.26s)]
*  channels to some vintage racism right after in the, during the holiday season. Okay. But as I was [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=851.02s)]
*  saying, the article in and of itself is also still saying like, Oh, well, this is a war that Israel's [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=858.22s)]
*  waging against Hamas, but it's actually having a hard time. Oh, he already lost the account. It [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=864.06s)]
*  already got perm aside band. Nice. I don't know why people write stuff like this because obviously [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=869.5s)]
*  they, you know, they're going to get perma banned, but in any case, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=874.7800000000001s)]
*  go get the food. He's leaving. Oh, doors open. Marlowe order food. And then anyway, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=882.62s)]
*  every Christmas you break out the old Catholic ornaments. Can you fall raised? We're bringing [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=889.34s)]
*  old racism back. Yeah. It was on a seed says manufacturing and denial is the editorial [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=892.38s)]
*  mandate. The New York times Palestinian civilians aren't collateral damage. They are the target in [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=897.82s)]
*  an explicit campaign of extermination that has also been recognized by every major human rights [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=901.58s)]
*  group and sites scholar. New York times dropped this article a day after five journalists were [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=905.74s)]
*  targeted and killed in an Israeli airstrike on their clearly marked press van loosens rules [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=909.98s)]
*  though. And it's kind of crazy because this article not only is too little too late, but beyond the [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=914.22s)]
*  fact that it's too little too late is still serving the purpose of making it seem as though Israel is [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=920.3000000000001s)]
*  simply just trying to combat Hamas and punish Hamas for October 7 for the crimes of October 7. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=926.54s)]
*  When in fact, that's not the sole purpose. The real purpose of Israel's military campaign here [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=933.0999999999999s)]
*  is ethnic cleansing and ethnic displacement. That much is clear. And it's not just my assessment [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=938.9399999999999s)]
*  of the matter. Like I said, virtually every single human rights group has also come to that conclusion, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=943.18s)]
*  a system of mass starvation and, and the death and destruction and complete destruction of the [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=949.0999999999999s)]
*  entirety of the civilian infrastructure with the hopes of permanent annexation and mass relocation [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=956.54s)]
*  and and and repopulating parts of the Gaza Strip with Israeli settlers. Here are some of the main [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=963.8199999999999s)]
*  takeaways from the investigation race threshold for civilian harm per preemptive strike expanded [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=971.0999999999999s)]
*  list of targets lifted caps on how many civilians could be endangered each day struck too fast to [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=977.02s)]
*  vet all targets properly, often relied on outdated intelligence use artificial intelligence to help [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=981.0999999999999s)]
*  search targets often drop large and accurate bombs frequently use a crude risk assessment. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=985.82s)]
*  Once again, this is not simply this is not simply Israel going oops, we actually changed it. We [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=990.3000000000001s)]
*  actually changed our our targeting capabilities. This is a deliberate attempt to kill as many [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=996.38s)]
*  people while still shrouded under the auspices of international rules of conflict. Okay, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1002.62s)]
*  just letting you know if they pivot to criticizing Israel's attacks as soon as Trump comes in office, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1007.74s)]
*  they really will just be a Democrat platform. Do you guys understand what the problem is here? Do [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1011.98s)]
*  you understand like what my issue is with this coverage? claiming that this is simply a mistake [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1016.78s)]
*  is not correct. Claiming that this is simply a mistake and not a deliberate campaign of ethnic [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1022.3000000000001s)]
*  cleansing. Okay, is is still manufacturing consent to make it seem as though Israel is just simply [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1028.8600000000001s)]
*  applying artificial intelligence in his targeting systems as a mistake that has caused a tremendous [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1036.22s)]
*  amount of a mistake that has caused a tremendous amount of accidental collateral damage, and not a [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1043.6599999999999s)]
*  system of mass starvation mass displacement with the with the overt purpose of engaging in ethnic [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1051.6599999999999s)]
*  cleansing. It serves the purpose of defending the higher ups from additional legal scrutiny [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1058.54s)]
*  and manufacturer consent at the behest of Israel that they're simply trying but failing to create [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1064.7s)]
*  a security corridor. Okay, this is not a mistake. These are not simple mistakes and accidents. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1070.7s)]
*  This is deliberate. It is manufactured chaos. A lot of people will point to like the World [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1079.02s)]
*  Central kitchen and say the World Central kitchen bombing, for example, and in order to defend [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1085.74s)]
*  Israel's actions say, Oh, it's just like people getting out of control. You know, people not [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1090.7s)]
*  listening to people not there's a there's a failure of communication with the with the higher chain [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1095.5800000000002s)]
*  of command in terms of targeting. That's not the case. Okay, it is deliberate. It is a killing field [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1101.1000000000001s)]
*  deliberately created so that people can turn around and say, Oh, there's just like mistakes along the [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1109.26s)]
*  line. Okay, these are not coincidences. These are not, you know, unlucky instances. These are, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1115.26s)]
*  this is deliberately created in a way so that you can kill as many people as possible. That's it. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1123.98s)]
*  It is kind of crazy that they just take, they took this long to even cover it. And even in [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1129.58s)]
*  their coverage, they're still offering protection to and offering credence to the arguments that [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1148.86s)]
*  claim plausible deniability. There's no way to look at this other than the New York Times [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1157.18s)]
*  deliberate deliberately trying to defend Israel still. Okay. Meanwhile, Haritz had an incredibly [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1161.74s)]
*  damning article. The editorial board tore the original article apart. Yeah. Meanwhile, on the [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1169.82s)]
*  one hand, New York Times is still trying to desperately grab onto any sense of like credibility [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1175.82s)]
*  that they have by at least sometimes covering like this months, months too late. But while they're [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1180.22s)]
*  doing that, while they're doing that, on the other hand, the editorial board is just like [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1187.18s)]
*  running full-scale defense and full-scale propaganda at the behest of Israel very [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1192.7800000000002s)]
*  deliberately and very directly. It's a, it's, it's totally utterly ridiculous. Anyway, there was a [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1196.38s)]
*  take from, Oh yeah. Noah reading the New York Times is crazy making because they'll have a story [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1203.26s)]
*  detailing the side that some of the same reporters slash editors denied months ago [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1208.86s)]
*  and which others in the paper use the MIT editorial real estate to still deny. Yeah. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1213.02s)]
*  Do they get paid or do they just love Israel? No, they don't get paid in the, there is no direct [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1217.8999999999999s)]
*  compensation for defending Israel. It doesn't work that way. It's just that Israel's goals of [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1223.58s)]
*  ethnic cleansing align with America's top down state department goals in the region. And therefore [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1228.62s)]
*  you get elevated if you play ball and in many circumstances, as Noam Chomsky is correctly [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1235.82s)]
*  pointed out time and time again, you don't even know that you're deliberately doing this. You get [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1243.34s)]
*  to the point that you're in media. You get elevated to a point in media because you authentically and [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1249.42s)]
*  organically have these opinions. Okay. That's it. There is no, you don't need a formal conspiracy [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1256.06s)]
*  when interests align exactly. So you literally get paid yet, but not paid in the sense that like [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1262.22s)]
*  someone wants to uncover the truth about Israel's actions, but then they get paid under, they get [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1267.5s)]
*  paid by some like massage agent or whatever. And the way that people try to create a grand [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1272.46s)]
*  conspiracy, it's not, it's not a grand conspiracy at all. There is already a, there is a filter [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1276.54s)]
*  system. Okay. There is a filter system. If you are consistently creating adversarial investigative [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1283.18s)]
*  reporting, you are not going to get elevated to the highest ranks within the New York Times to [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1292.94s)]
*  begin with. That's it. And that's how you, you, you, you know, even on your best objective [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1297.9s)]
*  journalistic interests, even, even at best when you're trying to, you know, engage in some kind [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1306.14s)]
*  of real journalism, you end up doing it like this anyway, from that Harrods article, you're [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1312.54s)]
*  referencing, Oh, here's the Chomsky. Could we start by listening to explain what the propaganda [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1319.82s)]
*  model, as you call it is for many people, the idea that propaganda is used by democratic rather than [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1326.94s)]
*  nearly authoritarian governments will be a strange one. Well, the term propaganda fell into disfavor [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1333.5s)]
*  around the second world war. But in the 1920s and the 1930s, it was commonly used and in fact [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1341.42s)]
*  advocated not by leading intellectuals, by the founders of modern political science, by [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1348.1399999999999s)]
*  Wilsonian progressives, and of course by the public relations industry as a necessary technique [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1354.22s)]
*  to overcome the danger of democracy. The institutional structure of the media is quite [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1360.7s)]
*  straightforward. We're talking about the United States. I'm going to be real quick. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1365.74s)]
*  Different elsewhere. The major there are sectors, but the agenda setting media, the ones that sort [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1368.7s)]
*  of set the framework for everyone else, like the New York Times and the Washington Post and so on. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1375.5800000000002s)]
*  These are major corporations, parts of even bigger conglomerates. Like other corporate institutions, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1380.7s)]
*  they have a product with an a market. Their market is advertisers, that is other businesses. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1387.66s)]
*  Their product is relatively privileged audiences, more or less. They're selling audiences. They're [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1393.74s)]
*  selling privileged audiences. These are big corporations selling privileged audiences to [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1399.3400000000001s)]
*  other corporations. Now the question is, what picture of the world would a rational person [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1404.3s)]
*  expect to come out of this structure? Then we draw some conclusions about what you'd expect, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1410.22s)]
*  and then we check, and yes, that's the picture of the world that comes out. And is this anything more [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1414.7s)]
*  than the idea that basically the press is relatively right-wing, with some exceptions, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1419.5s)]
*  because it's owned by big business, which is a truism is well known. Well, I would call the [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1425.26s)]
*  press relatively liberal. Here I agree with the right-wing critics, so especially the New York [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1429.74s)]
*  Times and the Washington Post, which are called, without a trace of irony, the New York Times is [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1435.1000000000001s)]
*  called the establishment left in, say, major foreign policy journals. And that's correct, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1440.6200000000001s)]
*  but what's not recognized is that the role of the liberal intellectual establishment [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1446.3s)]
*  is to set very sharp bounds on how far you can go, this far and no further. Give me some examples of [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1451.58s)]
*  that. Well, let's take, say, the Vietnam War, the probably the leading critic, and in fact one of [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1457.58s)]
*  the leading dissident intellectuals in the mainstream is Anthony Lewis of the New York Times, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1462.3799999999999s)]
*  who did finally come around to opposing the Vietnam War about 1969, about a year and a half [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1468.46s)]
*  after corporate America had more or less ordered Washington to call it off. And his picture from [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1474.38s)]
*  then on is that the war, as he put it, began with blundering efforts to do good, but it ended up [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1479.98s)]
*  by 1969 being a disaster and costing us too much. So what would the non-propaganda model have told [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1486.7800000000002s)]
*  Americans about the Vietnam War at the same time? Same thing that the mainstream press was telling [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1494.46s)]
*  them about Afghanistan. The United States invaded, had first of all in the 1950s, had set up [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1498.6200000000001s)]
*  standard Latin American style terror state which had captured tens of thousands of people, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1504.38s)]
*  but was unable to mean to control local, a local uprising, and everyone knows, at least every [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1509.66s)]
*  specialist knows that's what it was. And when Kennedy came in in 1961, they had to make a [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1516.38s)]
*  decision because the government was collapsing under local attack, so the U.S. just invaded the [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1521.18s)]
*  country. In 1961, the U.S. Air Force started bombing South Vietnamese civilians, authorized [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1525.2600000000002s)]
*  napalm crop destruction. Then in 1965, January, February 1965, the next major escalation took [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1531.26s)]
*  place against South Vietnam, not against North Vietnam, that was a sideshow. That's what an [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1539.1s)]
*  honest press would be saying, but you can't find a trace of it. Now if the press is a censoring [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1544.54s)]
*  organization, tell me how that works. This part is the important part. You're not suggesting that [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1550.3799999999999s)]
*  proprietors phone one another up or that many journalists get their copy spiked as we say? [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1556.14s)]
*  It's actually Orwell, you may recall, has an essay called Literary Censorship in England, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1562.46s)]
*  which was supposed to be the introduction to Animal Farm, except that it never appeared, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1569.66s)]
*  in which he points out, look I'm writing about a totalitarian society, but in free [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1573.66s)]
*  democratic England it's not all that different. And then he says unpopular ideas can be silenced [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1577.8200000000002s)]
*  without any force. And then he gives a two sentence response, which is not very profound, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1584.7s)]
*  but captures it. He says two reasons. First, the press is owned by wealthy men who have every [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1590.8600000000001s)]
*  interest in not having certain things appear, but second, the whole educational system from [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1596.3s)]
*  the beginning on through just gets you to understand that there are certain things you just don't say. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1601.42s)]
*  Well, spelling these things out, that's perfectly correct. I mean, it's the first sentences [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1608.46s)]
*  what we expand on. This is what I don't get, because it suggests that, I mean, I'm a judge, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1614.54s)]
*  people like me are self-censoring. No, not self-censoring. There's a filtering system [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1618.14s)]
*  that starts in kindergarten, goes all the way through, and it doesn't work 100%, but [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1624.22s)]
*  it's pretty effective. It selects for obedience and subordination. So, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1631.58s)]
*  stroppy people won't make it to positions of influence. There will be behaviour problems, or [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1639.98s)]
*  if you read applications to a graduate school, you see that people will tell you, he's not, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1645.18s)]
*  doesn't get along too well with his colleagues. You know how to interpret those things. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1651.5s)]
*  I'm just interested in this because I was brought up, like a lot of people, [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1655.18s)]
*  probably post the Watergate film and so on, to believe that journalism was a crusading [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1659.1s)]
*  craft and that there were a lot of disputatious, stroppy, difficult people in journalism. And I [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1664.86s)]
*  have to say, I think I know some of them. Well, I know some of the best and best [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1669.98s)]
*  known investigative reporters. Baja Blasmyn, Brandzell. Thank you for the 20, thank you. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1674.86s)]
*  In the United States, I won't mention names, because I'm like, whose attitude toward the media [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1678.62s)]
*  is much more cynical than mine. All news orgs have people on the inside can apply internal pressure [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1682.94s)]
*  on their leadership. How can the leadership of the New York Times resist such pressure for so long? [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1687.6599999999999s)]
*  Is it appropriate to assume the majority of the New York Times is complicit with what the [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1691.18s)]
*  leadership does? This is something that I've tried to explain to a lot of people. I, as you know, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1694.0600000000002s)]
*  I know a lot of journalists, okay. In a lot of these reputable outlets, some brilliant [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1699.8200000000002s)]
*  investigative reporters. Okay. I talk to them. I talk to them in private. I talk to them publicly [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1704.78s)]
*  sometimes. As you guys know, I have them on the stream and the, the, it's not, yeah. Flex on us, [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1710.78s)]
*  sir. This is not a flex. This is me telling you what I know. There are literally journalists, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1718.7s)]
*  photojournalism, whatnot, that are in this community that are routine chatters as well. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1725.18s)]
*  Okay. And as far as I understand the, the attitude, especially towards like Israel, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1730.8600000000001s)]
*  especially towards Israel, Palestine, or American foreign policy, the, the interest of like doing [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1737.9s)]
*  real adversarial journalism in that regard is very much something that is happening with younger [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1744.06s)]
*  journalists in all of these institutions, in all these legacy publications. The problem is the [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1750.06s)]
*  editorial team that has been elevated to the position that they're in have been elevated [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1755.98s)]
*  because of their ideological, their, their ideological goals that are completely in line [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1759.8999999999999s)]
*  with whatever the American State Department project is. And this is precisely, this is [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1766.62s)]
*  precisely the reason why, while they want to do real journalism, editorial teams will just be like, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1772.38s)]
*  all right, we're going to chop this article up until it's basically saying the exact opposite [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1778.3000000000002s)]
*  of what the actual truth is, or they just straight up don't publish pithily. What would you do if [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1782.7s)]
*  you lost your job because you rocked the boat? How would you eat brother? That is such a funny thing [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1789.2600000000002s)]
*  to ask someone like myself, because what I do is basically what I have done in my career is basically [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1794.14s)]
*  sidestep this entire legacy publisher process and go direct to the source in a way that is [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1801.1s)]
*  contentious to the interests of the American State Department. Like that is hilarious to come to [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1806.78s)]
*  someone like myself and, and ask this question, because if it wasn't for my subscribers that [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1812.78s)]
*  I've been able to, in this community that I've been able to cultivate, okay. That I've been able [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1820.6999999999998s)]
*  to cultivate over the course of the past six years of consistently doing reporting and [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1825.9s)]
*  consistently doing commentary and the, and the subscription revenue model that I've cultivated [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1830.7s)]
*  for myself, I would not be able to do the things that I'm doing right now. I would not be able to [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1836.7s)]
*  have the mass profile that I have right now, but it's a, it's a reminder that yes, I am an [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1841.1000000000001s)]
*  independent resource that tries to do his very best to ensure that I'm covering everything with [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1847.5800000000002s)]
*  integrity. And, and, and there, there is no me equivalent in the mainstream press. I wish there [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1852.46s)]
*  were, okay. I wish there were more people who were like-minded to myself who are in legacy publishers [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1860.14s)]
*  who are actively writing New York times op-eds, for example, but you don't get to the point of a [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1869.02s)]
*  Brett Stevens by rocking the boat. You get to that point by not doing that by, by consistently [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1874.14s)]
*  finding yourself in line with the interests of, of the American state department. If you're [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1881.74s)]
*  covering foreign policy, the interests of corporations, the wealthy, when you're covering [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1886.14s)]
*  domestic issues, it's not an accident that the New York times, and this is, this is, this is a great [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1889.74s)]
*  moment to talk about this in terms of foreign policy. We already know, right? There is a major [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1895.74s)]
*  divergence. Okay. There is a major divergence there in terms of a foreign policy of like what [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1900.38s)]
*  most people see, what most people can see and what most people comprehend versus what is getting [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1906.22s)]
*  presented as truth in mainstream press. But a similar instance is occurring right now in real [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1912.94s)]
*  time as well with domestic, with domestic policy, healthcare. A lot of people are very upset, [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1919.5s)]
*  understandably by the for-profit healthcare industry. And that is part of the reason why [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1927.18s)]
*  many people have a differing opinion on Luigi Mangione and his actions than the way that the [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1934.3s)]
*  mainstream press is presenting it. Why do you- [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoQY2GBkvro&t=1942.06s)]
