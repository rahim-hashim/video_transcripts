# Don’t Let Zohran Become The Next Kamala Harris | HasanAbi Archive
**HasanAbi:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo)
*  Zoram Umdani. That's former DSA member Jerry Nadler dog. I'm sorry, but if you were alive [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=0.0s)]
*  when Eugene Debs was alive and you haven't been a member for, for almost a hundred years, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=7.04s)]
*  that is not as significant as like Brad Lander being a former DSA member until like 2023. Okay. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=17.84s)]
*  Let's go. Oh yeah. I do want to talk about, say that my colleagues in the New York congressional [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=30.8s)]
*  delegation and I, we do not care about the democratic socialist of America. We're focused [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=35.6s)]
*  on defeating congressional Republicans in the midterms and making Hakeem Jeffries, the speaker [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=40.8s)]
*  of the house and reversing the catastrophic consequences of the Republican reconciliation bill. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=44.72s)]
*  We could care less about Mickey Mouse primary challenges. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  Now, Mickey Mouse primary challenges, huh? He's doing it. He's doing it. This is, he's gonna, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=54.4s)]
*  he's gonna fix the, he's gonna fix his chances. Which did not appear in one day. It's clearly an [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=64.64s)]
*  accumulation that's been here for several days. Like where's sanitation? Like where's the NYPD? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=69.6s)]
*  I don't see anyone here. I've not seen a single police officer. I've not seen a single sanitation [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=74.48s)]
*  worker. I have not seen a single public health worker. Is he in the Bronx? Because let me tell [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=79.6s)]
*  you, there is a lot of, there are a lot of cops. Okay. Let me tell you, first of all, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=83.84s)]
*  I don't know why you would say like, where is the NYPD here? If anything, too much NYPD presence in [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=89.92s)]
*  the Bronx. Okay. It says that the city is absentee in what is one of the most heavily traffic [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  commercial corridors in the city. Which did not appear. It is kind of wild where he's like, bro, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=103.12s)]
*  this district that I never attend and care very little about because it's not Tel Aviv, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=108.96s)]
*  the only district I care about, seemingly is in a state of disrepair. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=116.32s)]
*  Where are the politicians? Why won't they do anything about this? Where are the politicians? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=122.88s)]
*  I say, Richie Torres, the congressional representative of the district that I'm inside [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=128.4s)]
*  of that I am filming alongside Walter White, it seems. How did he win? How did he actually [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=134.8s)]
*  win this district? He was very progressive. He ran as a very progressive guy. A lot of people [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=146.16000000000003s)]
*  forget. He was like, listen, I'm young, I'm black, I'm Afro Latino, I'm bi like, or I think gay, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=152.0s)]
*  I don't know. Like, but he was like, I'm queer, young black. I'm very progressive. Like he, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=158.88000000000002s)]
*  he literally ran as like a, like a major, major progressive figure initially. And then quickly [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=162.64s)]
*  cast that aside. It can feel like activism is futile, but the activists are slowly steadily [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=170.72s)]
*  moving the needle. If it were not for their efforts to publicize what is being done to Gaza, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  the public would just never know. First opinion shifts, then politics shifts. Eventually policy [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=180.39999999999998s)]
*  will shift. And Nathan J. Robinson, the most vindicated man in American politics is [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=186.16s)]
*  right on this as well. I realized that can't bring back any lies, but what is being done to [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=192.23999999999998s)]
*  Gaza depends on US support. If the US wanted to stop, they could do it tomorrow. So the US [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=196.32s)]
*  activists are changing US opinion. To pressure US politicians to change US policy is the urgent [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=200.88s)]
*  task. Throw any US politician out of office unless they commit to withdrawing all funding from Israel [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=205.76s)]
*  immediately plus sanctioning Israel until it ends the occupation, pays reparations and joins [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=210.23999999999998s)]
*  most of the rest of the world in recognizing the state of Palestine. He is correct on this. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=214.56s)]
*  This is a classic progressive except for Palestine. That's why every politician must [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=219.76s)]
*  have a position on this. Oh, for sure. I did see this and I don't know what this means. And I am [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=224.79999999999998s)]
*  a little worried about it, but it is what it is. You know, Mum Donnie has hired Jeffrey Lerner, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=229.92s)]
*  a former political director of the DNC to serve as his new communications director. Mr. Lerner also [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=234.56s)]
*  once worked for Mr. Mum Donnie's primary rival, Andrew Cuomo. Definitely an interesting, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=238.39999999999998s)]
*  uh, an interesting move. Yeah. Don't know what that means. Don't know why. I mean, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=243.28s)]
*  he worked for Cuomo in 2007. He hates him since. No, I don't care about him working for Cuomo [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=249.35999999999999s)]
*  in 2007. I do care about him being a DNC and senior Senate aide, a former political director [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=254.32s)]
*  of the democratic national committee is, is, uh, I think more important, but I think like a good, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=263.36s)]
*  I think this is good by Zoram because he's trying to make, get better placement in traditional media [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=268.88s)]
*  and age. Bizzle. You and I have been at odds with the Kamala stuff. If you recall, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=273.6s)]
*  I feel like my instincts of, of, uh, hoping that, uh, people do not shy away from, uh, being earnest, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=280.16s)]
*  which allowed Zoran to win and cut through the noise in this crowded primary field with a lot [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=289.04s)]
*  of wonderful progressive, with a lot of wonderful progressive, uh, uh, politicians was correct. As [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=294.40000000000003s)]
*  you also recall, just as I, my criticism of Kamala Harris were also correct. I don't know. I mean, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=302.64s)]
*  I'm not, uh, we'll see how it plays itself out, but Andrew Epstein is the guy, right? Who has [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=309.28s)]
*  been overseeing both news and social media for the campaign. Like Andrew Epstein, from what I [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=315.44s)]
*  understand is like the, the, the creative vision, the creative force behind all of this initially [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=318.71999999999997s)]
*  and his team and their, uh, his, his team of like genuine supporters, um, played a, a formative role [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=324.56s)]
*  and, and allowed him to actually, uh, win the primary. And I do hope that he doesn't, uh, shift [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=334.15999999999997s)]
*  away from that earnesty with the hopes of like, I don't know, winning a bunch of, uh, supposed like, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=341.59999999999997s)]
*  uh, uh, democratic establishment voters or something. I think he's smart enough to have the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=349.03999999999996s)]
*  aid, but not be subservient to it. All a Kamala, I hope. Yeah. I don't, no, no, no. I, I, I'm not [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=354.71999999999997s)]
*  worried about him becoming like fake or whatever. Okay. I'm not worried about that. Um, I'm not [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=360.71999999999997s)]
*  worried about that at all. I'm worried of how he presents himself going forward. Cause like, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=366.24s)]
*  there is a level of, of, of liberal language that he applies, that he deploys. That's perfect. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=372.4s)]
*  Right now. And, uh, any kind of, uh, steering in the direction of even, uh, more calculated language [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=379.12s)]
*  will most likely dilute his message and will, uh, play away from the earnesty, play away from the, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=386.23999999999995s)]
*  the earnesty that has actually performed spectacularly for him so far. Do you understand? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=392.64s)]
*  Harvey Epstein is a good dude. No, that's not Harvey Epstein. We're talking about Andrew Epstein, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=399.91999999999996s)]
*  who was the previous like social media and news mind behind the operation. I will say, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=404.32000000000005s)]
*  shouts out to Nadler by the way, um, shouts out to Nadler. Uh, he has surprised me. Maybe I was, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=410.88s)]
*  uh, maybe I was too critical on establishment Democrats because a lot of the, uh, where, where [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=417.92s)]
*  is it? A lot of the, uh, the, the, uh, Zionist Twitter accounts are currently losing their minds [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=428.16s)]
*  over, um, what Nadler did. Uh, Jerry Nadler is being considered as Hamas now. I regret every [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=434.96000000000004s)]
*  vote I ever cast for representative Jerry Nadler. I hope to see a viable primary challenger who [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=442.24s)]
*  stands up for Jewish safety instead of telling us that the piss on our legs from the far left is [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=446.96000000000004s)]
*  actually rain. Why is he saying this? This liberal Zionist account Jewish walk because Nadler aides [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=451.28000000000003s)]
*  have been working with Mamdani's team to build up a new mayoral nominees outreach into areas of [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=457.2s)]
*  Manhattan where he did not do well among Jewish communities suspicious of the assemblyman's views [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=460.88s)]
*  on Israel. That's right. Nadler not only was one of the first like prominent Democratic party [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=465.03999999999996s)]
*  establishment figures that actually endorsed, uh, Zoram Mamdani that's former DSA member, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=469.44s)]
*  Jerry Nadler dog. I'm sorry, but if you were alive when Eugene Debs was alive and you haven't been [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=474.96s)]
*  a member for, for almost a hundred years, that that is not as significant as like Brad Lander [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=483.84000000000003s)]
*  being a former DSA member until like 2023. Okay. Jerry, now they're trying to move the left to [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=492.72s)]
*  avoid the establishment. Primary person is coming in. Shall law. I don't know. I don't know what is [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=499.28000000000003s)]
*  like motivation is. Um, I also think he's super old, so it might not, it might not be, uh, all [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=503.44s)]
*  that consequential for him. I have the funniest anecdote around this election. One of my coworkers [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=510.88s)]
*  in our office in another department founded the DSA chapter at university of Chicago with [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=514.88s)]
*  Brad and Lander back in the late eighties. Yeah. Brad Lander has been a DSA guy for a very long time [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=518.24s)]
*  and was a dues paying member of the DSA card carrying dues paying member of the DSA until [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=522.96s)]
*  2023. And that has not stopped him from obviously endorsing and literally becoming a human shield, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=528.4s)]
*  a Jewish human shield against the Islamophobic cynical antisemitism smears against Zoram [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=535.2s)]
*  Mdani, which played a formative role in like the way that I think a lot of voters viewed Zoram [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=541.44s)]
*  Mdani in a positive way in spite of the unimaginable amount of a horrible anti Zoran [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=547.2s)]
*  coverage. Why he left is more relevant than any participation he had in the past. No, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=555.0400000000001s)]
*  what he's doing now currently is more relevant than, uh, his, his reasons for leaving, uh, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=559.28s)]
*  the DSA in my opinion. Also, we don't know the exact details. Forward magazine suspects it's [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=566.16s)]
*  because of October 7th and there could be truth to that. The DSA position on October 7th and the [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=571.28s)]
*  DSA position on Palestine after October 7th. Okay. Was he actually alive when Eugene devs was alive? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=575.36s)]
*  Um, I don't know. It was exaggerating. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnVDK70bNo&t=580.4s)]
