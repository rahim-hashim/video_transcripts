# South Korean President Faces Detention | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE)
*  Why was the Biden White House so musical? I feel like there's far too many devastating [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=0.0s)]
*  events that have taken place under the Brandon regime that you can splice with footage of [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  like someone directly involved singing shit. What is happening there? Biden was there when [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=12.16s)]
*  music was invent. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=18.44s)]
*  Based on South Korea, by the way, before I forget South Korea's president with a word [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=25.52s)]
*  now for his barricaded himself in his house with the help of their version of the secret [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=29.92s)]
*  service and they're prepared to go down. So, so they gave up. The police gave up. The PSS [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=33.0s)]
*  blocked the CIO from placing you in under for approximately five and a half hours on [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=41.84s)]
*  Friday, eventually leading the CIO to back down at the time. The PSS blocked entry into [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=45.2s)]
*  the residence by using buses and military vehicles and 200 or so PSS agents linked arms [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=49.04s)]
*  to form a human barrier against CIO investigators attempting to gain access to the residence. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=54.68s)]
*  There are also claims that military forces were employed to secure the area, which the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=59.96s)]
*  PSS has since denied after successfully the effort to arrest the president. The PSS spent [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=62.96s)]
*  the following weekend setting up more vehicle barriers on the road, leading the presidential [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=67.52s)]
*  residence while also installing military grade barbed wire around the residence. I didn't [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=70.8s)]
*  realize you had motion like that. My mistake. I didn't realize that the UN sells the goon [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=75.84s)]
*  squad, the unors, the UN gooners, the unis were out and about like that. My mistake. I [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=82.12s)]
*  was not familiar with the motion that the goon squad had opposition parties suspect [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=90.03999999999999s)]
*  the PSS of issuing guidelines to his agents to be prepared for the possibility of using [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=95.92s)]
*  live ammo during a press briefing on this day, the democratic party's committee for [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=99.44s)]
*  investigating the alleged insurrection said that during this process of carrying out the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=103.12s)]
*  the CIOs or PSS chief Park Chung-Jun gave his men the order to use blanks if they were [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  pushed back in his scuffle and to use live ammunition if that doesn't work. However, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  the PSS denied the claim stating we would like to make it clear that Park never gave [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=119.28s)]
*  the order to fire upon CIO employees, nor did he ever even consider such an order. The [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=122.24000000000001s)]
*  police booked Park on charges of special obstruction of public duty and ordered him to appear for [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=127.12s)]
*  questioning on Saturday, January 4th and response to PSS said the head of the presidential security [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=131.8s)]
*  service cannot leave his post even for a moment. And Park did not appear. The police summoned [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=136.44s)]
*  Park again demanding his appearance on Tuesday, but Park has not responded. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=140.4s)]
*  Got to imagine the plan is to wait out the siege until January 20th and then hope the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=143.4s)]
*  Trump admin pulls some strings. The tiny number of counter protesters supporting you and our [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=146.8s)]
*  waving American flags and English sign saying stop the steal. But the flip side is that [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=150.60000000000002s)]
*  this is that you and his Biden and Blinken's guy, they've all been stood by him the past [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=154.60000000000002s)]
*  month. Blinken himself is in Seoul right now and hasn't said a damn thing about it. Even [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=159.36s)]
*  Korean opposition parties are on board with Biden and Blinken's anti China stances. The [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=163.36s)]
*  main reason the US is so strongly behind you is because you and has been willing to circumvent [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=168.28s)]
*  South Korean law to fund a larger mass artillery shells to Ukraine. Or maybe they're just friends. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=171.88000000000002s)]
*  It's been a while, but maybe ever thought about that. Maybe they just love one another. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=176.52s)]
*  A long, long time ago, I can still remember how that music used to make me smile. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=185.0s)]
*  And now I knew you fed my chains that I can make those people then send. Maybe they'd be happy for a while. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=193.36s)]
*  February made me shiver. Really paper I deliver. Bad news on the doorstep. I couldn't talk one more step. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=203.36s)]
*  I can't remember if I tried when I read about these we all bright. Something touched me deep inside the day the music. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=216.36s)]
*  Oh, come on. You're not gonna sing the best part. I was a fellow who wrote that song was American pie that couldn't be here tonight. But he wanted you to have his sign guitar. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=231.36s)]
*  Why was the Biden White House so musical? I feel like there's far too many devastating events that have taken place under the Brandon regime that you can splice with footage of like someone directly involved singing shit. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=241.36s)]
*  What is happening there? Biden was there when music was invent. Not as musical when RBJ died during the drum batman. True. I mean, here is a well, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=257.36s)]
*  Well, what? What is this? I thought you were going to send me the blink in. Yeah. Rocking in the free world. Here it is. US secretary of state. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=269.36s)]
*  Anthony Blinken performs rocking to the free world in a bar. They cut his mic out, dude. They were like, come on dog. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=276.36s)]
*  I mean, this is better though. This is the best one when he sang hoochie coochie man. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=283.36s)]
*  Bro, can you please stop sending me this video on anti North Korean propaganda? Please, please, please. I beg of you. Please. I don't know why you just like have valuable input in between. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=295.36s)]
*  And then you go back to this video. This amazing video on the falsities of the West propaganda on North Korea. I am not going to watch the loyal citizens of Pyongyang. Okay. From the YouTube channel, the DPRK newsroom. I'm not going to watch it right now. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=309.36s)]
*  I'm going to watch it. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=324.36s)]
*  Woman told my mother before I was born. Gonna be a man child coming. Gonna be son of the gun. Gonna make pretty women's jump and shout and the world will know what it's all about. You know, I'm hey, everybody knows I'm hey. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=327.36s)]
*  It's amazing. I don't know what's going on. I'm an NMP viewer. This is secretary of state, Anthony Blinken who oversaw probably one of the more destructive American foreign policy regimes around the globe. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=348.36s)]
*  Just a sequence of L after L after L with which led to a lot of death and devastation globally, poorly singing hoochie coochie man. Are you not worried about being banned from Twitch for showing the shit? Oh, this is black sent by the way. That's my favorite. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=363.36s)]
*  Okay, that is the best comment of the day today. Canceling canceling Anthony Blinken for blacks. This is up there with Hitler's age gap relationship in terms of in terms of probably the like canceling notoriously horrific criminals for minor offenses in comparison to the the awful things that they've done. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=383.36s)]
*  Oh, that's amazing. Oh, like this man is getting sued by the all jokes aside, he's getting I think he's like being personally sued by the victims of the that he's oversaw that is overseen. And you're like, I'll have you know, he's doing a V here kind of problematic. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkpy0Ch5lhE&t=411.36s)]
*  Like he's a criminal man. What are you talking about? Throw him in jail? Where is this lady going? Are you going somewhere? Are you are you going somewhere? Is there is there somewhere you need to be? What's that? What's happening? Oh, nevermind. It's just I would like some pets please my time. hoochie coochie man.
