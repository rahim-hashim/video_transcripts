# KaiCenat Is In Trouble | Hasanabi Austinshow Reacts to Philip DeFranco
**HasanAbi:** [November 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g)
*  going you need to use logic in your brain and call things on. I'm not saying Kai is a bad guy, but [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=0.0s)]
*  he needs to be held accountable. What do you mean? What does anyone ever mean when they say he needs [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=4.32s)]
*  to be held accountable? I hate this. I hate this so much. And someone will clip this and go Hassan [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=8.24s)]
*  hates accountability. Okay. Explain what you mean. What do you mean? People say this all the time. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=12.88s)]
*  It was the most annoying that liberals used to say in like the 2016 social justice era. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=19.2s)]
*  Yeah. Let's start off with some what the hell news. It was the most requested story on the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=24.08s)]
*  text line for the past 12 hours. Let's talk about this Kaisanet situation. Dude, this is a insane [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=33.68s)]
*  situation. By the way, it's like not even a meme. If you guys are unfamiliar or unaware with what [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=40.0s)]
*  happened, it is a totally insane situation. And I'm going to issue a trigger warning because [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=47.2s)]
*  uh, no, it's not sexy red. Sexy red is not like the most, the craziest thing that occurred. Um, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=54.239999999999995s)]
*  Kaisanet, he'll, he'll get to it, but there was, there's a trigger warning for, uh, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=62.4s)]
*  like for those who don't know, Kaisanet is arguably like it didn't actually happen, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=67.52s)]
*  but it's like a wild, wild thing that occurred, like a simulated version of it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  One of the biggest streamers in the world right now. And he's in the middle of this marathon [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=77.75999999999999s)]
*  subathon where he became the most subscribed streamer in the world. Now we're seeing people [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=82.24s)]
*  yell, what the hell that was messed up or ban Kaisanet. And the reason they're saying that [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=87.28s)]
*  right now is because there was a stunt aired on his stream where it appeared that Kai pulled a [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  rope that then hung someone. Cause like I said, Kai has been doing this subathon. And last night [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=96.08s)]
*  he was joined by a magician by the name of Max Major, who seemingly had a surprise trick for [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=100.16s)]
*  him. Right? Cause when Kai walked outside to find Max, Max was already on a platform accompanied [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=104.32s)]
*  by three, which resulted in this reaction. Yo, what, bro, what is, Max, what the are you doing [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=108.08s)]
*  up there, Max? And then as they got closer to Max, he explained the stunt noting that there were three [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=114.48s)]
*  nooses up there with him and three cords with handles down by Kai. And in this setup, the way [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=118.72s)]
*  it's shown is that even though Kai couldn't see what cord belonged to which noose he was going to [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=122.24s)]
*  pull. This is disgusting and Kai deserves accountability for continuing to stream it. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=126.08s)]
*  Um, I think, I think I have a more nuanced position on this, but it's like what he tried to do, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  what he tried to do in this situation was to, to mitigate it. And it was like, don't show this, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=136.24s)]
*  don't show this to the, like, he literally pushed the camera down and in normal circumstances for [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=141.28s)]
*  the record, especially when you're like a very large content creator, obviously, and doing like [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=146.64s)]
*  this almost Hollywood level production, Twitch is going to be more understanding because it's real [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=152.16s)]
*  like it's live broadcasting. It's live broadcasting, like a television show. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=157.68s)]
*  So in an uncontrolled environment, there are going to be some issues, but it's the same principle [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=162.64s)]
*  behind, like, it's the same principle behind, for example, if I'm watching like news coverage [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  or something, and then there's like a, or if I'm watching something in real time and, and [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=173.67999999999998s)]
*  unexpectedly, there is like a blip or some kind of material like that. And I quickly scroll away, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=181.35999999999999s)]
*  Twitch is inconsistent in issuing bans on that, but usually they're very charitable [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=186.88s)]
*  and, and, and we'll, you know, we'll let you slide because while this was a pre-planned event, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=191.44s)]
*  I don't think, like, I think the entire nature of the pre-planned event was him not knowing what the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=200.16s)]
*  f**k was going to happen. You know what I mean? Yeah. It's the same as a sniper shouting s**t, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=205.76000000000002s)]
*  exactly. If a stream sniper runs up to you while you're live streaming and like, and this has [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  happened many times over and they like shout s**t, then it's not entirely your fault. Or if you're [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=213.84s)]
*  live streaming and then there's like a car crash that occurs, it's not entirely your fault. And I [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=220.56s)]
*  suspect that he knew 100% in my opinion. I think, I mean, I watched the video and it didn't seem like [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=226.4s)]
*  he knew what was going to happen. Like he knew, he didn't think that like the dude was going to be [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=233.04s)]
*  hanged. Do you know what I mean? Because very clearly, very clearly you can see the way he's, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=237.52s)]
*  the way he behaves after the dude, the dude is like simulated as hanging. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=244.32s)]
*  Whole one when Max told him to. Notably, Max attached to one of the news, but first he also [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=249.68s)]
*  warned the audience. I have to say that I'm a professional. It's my decision to do this. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=254.32s)]
*  I'm supervised by professionals. We have emergency personnel standing by and that absolutely no one [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=259.68s)]
*  should try anything like this or anything dangerous at home. I think he was looking for, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=265.52s)]
*  I think it was a, I also personally think that he's like, like the magician might've been looking [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=270.56s)]
*  for a clout. You know what I mean? And he did get it. I don't personally care, but don't you think [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=276.79999999999995s)]
*  the examples you gave are unpredictable and sudden while this is a pretty long situation? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=281.52s)]
*  Yeah. I don't think that this was going to be the outcome. Like, I don't think he was, he thought [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=286.47999999999996s)]
*  that he would be, you know, hanging someone. Do a pull test where Kai pulled one of the [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=290.96s)]
*  cords to see what would happen. And sure enough, one of the news is goes up. But then after that [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=296.79999999999995s)]
*  test, Max putting his head through one of the news is that with only two cords left to pull, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=300.15999999999997s)]
*  it seemingly meant there was a 50, 50 shot that Kai was going to pull the one that Max was attached [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=304.24s)]
*  to. Initially with us, you have Kai seemingly getting worried. If I kill you, I go to jail, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=308.0s)]
*  right? No. Everyone in Kai's group also appears to start getting uneasy with the whole thing, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=311.84s)]
*  but Kai did as Max instructed and pulled one of the handles. And as it turned out, he pulled the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=318.16s)]
*  one that Max had put his head in. So Max goes up into the air for a few seconds, but his crew then [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=322.16s)]
*  quickly dropped him down and got him out. And with that, the reason I'm describing it rather than [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=326.48s)]
*  showing you is I do not think I can or would want to show you someone getting hung by a, but in the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=330.0s)]
*  aftermath, what we saw and what I can show you is Kai's reaction. Wait, I think the important part [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=335.44000000000005s)]
*  about this is that the immediate, cause I watched the, not the full thing, but I did watch the part [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=343.91999999999996s)]
*  where like he's literally hanging and they show him hanging. And it looks like, you know, it looks [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=349.52s)]
*  like a person hanging, right? And you can tell that he thinks he's just like caused this person [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=354.71999999999997s)]
*  a tremendous amount of pain. And not only that, but he also immediately tries to [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=362.71999999999997s)]
*  f**king immediately tries to move the camera away. Like it's not, I feel like, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=368.48s)]
*  I don't think that his expectation was that he was going to literally hang a dude. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=376.56s)]
*  Hassan, please Kai knew. Yeah, I don't hold on. Doors open. Sorry. Wait. So there wasn't actually [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=382.16s)]
*  a magic trigger at all. It was just a stunt. Yeah. But also you got to realize like he's probably [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=388.24s)]
*  going to lose a lot of sponsorship deals because of this. Like what the f**k would he, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=393.12s)]
*  why the f**k would he voluntarily be like, yeah, no, I like he most likely, he most likely lost [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=397.52s)]
*  his Nike deal from this. You know what I mean? Like there's no f**king shot that he was like, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=402.96s)]
*  yeah, great. I would love to lose my Nike deal. Kyson at you guys are forgetting is not a normal [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=407.52s)]
*  Twitch streamer. He is literally in between a Twitch streamer and in Hollywood entertainer, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=415.28000000000003s)]
*  the content that he's creating is television level production. And on top of that, I mean, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=422.4s)]
*  he's got McDonald's sponsorships and s**t. Okay. Nike, McDonald's, all these massive brands that [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=428.15999999999997s)]
*  sponsor all these massive brands that sponsor him. They're not going to f**k around with this [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=433.91999999999996s)]
*  kind of, with this kind of thing at all. So, you know, a dude appearing in like T mobile ads and [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=437.59999999999997s)]
*  s**t is not going to, not going to place himself in a, you know, in a, in a place where, oh s**t. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=444.32s)]
*  Nice. Yeah. It's for Thanksgiving. Just leave it on the kitchen counter. Why would the magician [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=454.48s)]
*  not run it past them? I, they probably, well, he doesn't need to know, I think for this bit to work [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=459.2s)]
*  from the mindset. If I put myself in the, if I put myself in the mindset of the, the magician, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=464.64s)]
*  you don't want the f**king person to know what you're going to do. I'm on, I'm on the, he knew [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=470.96s)]
*  train, watched the full VOD. It's on his property and there was like 10 minute lead up to the final [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=477.2s)]
*  poll. They might've thought it wouldn't actually happen, but he knew the possibility for sure. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=480.71999999999997s)]
*  I can see that. He's not going to lose his sponsors. Why are you overreacting so hard? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=484.15999999999997s)]
*  No, there's definitely a likelihood that he could lose sponsors. People are going to say, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=487.84s)]
*  you have a massive audience of children and you simulated a hanging. What are you talking about? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=491.67999999999995s)]
*  There was an entire reason why there is a f**king massive controversy surrounding the incident. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=496.32s)]
*  The f**k are you talking about? There's a re there's a hell of people in this shadow were like, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=500.64s)]
*  Oh no, he still pulled the, he still pulled off the stunt knowing full well that it could have [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=504.08s)]
*  been. So yeah, I think that I think that ultimately this is like a, a, a incident that absolutely [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=508.32s)]
*  would invoke a lot of controversy. And I don't think that he like, it's not even a, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=516.16s)]
*  his reaction is so immediate that I don't think it's like, Oh, I didn't, Oh, people are going to [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=522.16s)]
*  get mad at me for this. And now I f**ked up like that's the type of attitude that people would have [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=529.6s)]
*  if, if they did something, they thought it was chill and then they faced repercussions and then [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=535.28s)]
*  they changed their perspective. Okay. His, his attitude was immediate where like he was like, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=541.28s)]
*  Oh f**k what the f**k is going on? Okay. But like, what's the trick there that he didn't die. Yeah. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=547.2s)]
*  I don't really know what like the magician's goals were aside from, I think like just, you know, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=552.4s)]
*  trying to create some controversy. It's also a performance song. We watch actors and musicals [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=559.6s)]
*  and movies with violence. Otherwise seen as atrocious in real life context. This feels like [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=564.32s)]
*  kind of s**t. Yeah. That's why, because Twitch streaming blurs the lines of like something that [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=567.28s)]
*  is really happening and a television production, that's the other side of the story. That's the [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=571.28s)]
*  other reason why people are like, understandably more distraught by what they saw and also [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=577.36s)]

*  really funny joke, it's a banger shock magic. But if you, but if you actually fail to be funny in [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=1000.16s)]
*  the process of being edgy, then you come across like a racist piece of shit. And I think what he [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=1006.08s)]
*  was trying to do was basically that where he was like, Oh, this is an excellent prank. And then [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=1010.88s)]
*  because he didn't have like a, like a real, it seemed like there was no real like payoff, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=1017.2s)]
*  right? The payoff is just what traumatizing everyone that watched you be hanged. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=1025.3600000000001s)]

*  there was no like real punchline. There was no twist. It was just like a very, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=1038.88s)]

*  That was the magic. He never said he was going to survive. What the magic is that he got kind of [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=1082.72s)]
*  system in his suicide. Yeah. I guess that was supposed to be the mind read. I knew you were [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=1088.0800000000002s)]

*  straight up hang himself. I can't believe he did that. Like there, there must, there had to have [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=1444.64s)]
*  been a payoff. You know what I mean? Sometimes things like this happen in live entertainment. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=1450.8000000000002s)]

*  The first ever live hanging. I mean, we do need to up the ante. We had live childbirth this year. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=1477.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. At Twitch con live wedding, live childbirth next year is they have, they have tons of thousands [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=1482.0s)]

*  Probably suffering for some sort of mental health. And Kaisen had someone almost break their neck [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=1493.2s)]
*  for his enjoyment. And his first words are, I might get banned. And this is people saying, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=1496.64s)]
*  this homophobic pig deserves everything bad. And this is people saying that because of this, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=1500.4s)]
*  another reason he should be banned with other creators like XQC even chiming in. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=1505.1200000000001s)]

*  Kai saying, you know, he didn't know it was going to wait, excuse me. This is so funny. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=1521.76s)]

*  and hurts their feelings, but I just don't think that, you know, this is not, you know, this is [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=1711.84s)]

*  as well as then on the other end, the 50 50, will he get hung challenge insane concept. Like I [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=1786.4s)]
*  cannot imagine how hard it is to come up with new. I'm not going to lie. I feel like Philly is [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=1792.64s)]
*  sitting on the fence on this, but like, I kind of get where he's coming from because on the one hand, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=1798.16s)]
*  like I do not find myself on either side of this, like firmly. Okay. Yeah, no, this is, this is one [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=1803.76s)]
*  of those things where it's like, like, I don't think that I don't think that Kyson app personally [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=1810.8000000000002s)]
*  was like, yeah, it'll be sick. He's going to fucking be hanged or anything, but the very likelihood [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=1814.8000000000002s)]
*  that that that it was, was still there and it did end up happening is like still pretty bad. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=1819.68s)]
*  But overall, I assume that there's a number of different ways that that goes that plays out. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=1826.0800000000002s)]
*  And I suspect that he did not think he did not think that it would end up with him being like [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=1833.2s)]
*  this magician guy being fucking hanged. Two interesting ideas for 30 days straight of [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=1839.44s)]

*  if you didn't know, what are your thoughts about him even participating once he saw the set up? [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=1862.96s)]
*  Or where the situation do you end up falling in the camp of seeing Kai as the victim here? [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=1866.3999999999999s)]
*  He trusted someone that did something fucked up. Let me know what you're thinking and why. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=1870.32s)]

*  a side. They just want to see somebody get banned. Cause they don't like them. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=1891.3600000000001s)]
*  Like LSF has hated Kai forever. Like they've always hated Kai. That's a crazy image. It's [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=1895.1200000000001s)]

*  Chat has prosecuted transnational gangs. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2358.88s)]

*  Absolutely allergic to critiquing anyone with a substantial audience. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2404.88s)]
*  This is why no one takes you seriously. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2407.88s)]
*  Yes, you're right. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2408.88s)]

*  offering a substantive critique on the Kaisen ad situation. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2416.88s)]
*  And therefore they should not have taken me seriously on the prime time news slot that [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2419.88s)]
*  they afforded to my political commentary. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2424.88s)]
*  Please remove yourself from the horse blinders that you have over some utterly inconsequential [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2427.88s)]
*  bullshit that you feel is directly the most important thing in your life. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2434.88s)]
*  Oh yeah, let's analyze everything he's fucking said in here forever. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2439.88s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2481.88s)]
*  You you've done it. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2482.88s)]
*  You've you've hit it. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2484.88s)]
*  You've hit the angle. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2485.88s)]
*  Not like a utterly unserious Twitch drama being represented as something so significant [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2486.88s)]
*  that something so significant that like nobody takes you seriously. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2494.88s)]
*  First of all, I have criticized Kyson at plenty of times as a matter of fact on criticism [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2499.88s)]
*  worthy instances. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2505.88s)]
*  That is part of the reason why he, you know, it doesn't really fuck with me all that much. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2506.88s)]
*  Okay. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2511.88s)]
*  So that's number one. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2512.88s)]
*  Number two, the notion that I don't criticize people with massive followings is the funniest [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2513.88s)]
*  fucking thing of all time, especially considering that virtually every single top content creator [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2518.88s)]
*  on Twitch and their audiences despise me specifically because I have criticized them [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2524.88s)]
*  in in righteous moments. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2529.88s)]
*  As a matter of fact, like XQC or even as men Gold's audience who despises me for criticizing [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2531.88s)]
*  him. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2538.88s)]
*  Dr. Disrespect. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2539.88s)]
*  Nick Merckx. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2540.88s)]
*  Okay. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2541.88s)]
*  Is he still chirping about trans people? [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2542.88s)]
*  You know, it was funny. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2544.88s)]
*  Yeah, he is. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2545.88s)]
*  You know, it was funny. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2546.88s)]
*  Like I was talking to one voter. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2547.88s)]
*  I was talking to Dean about this in Texas where he was like, dude, you have a very different [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2548.88s)]
*  situation where you have government ops. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2553.88s)]
*  That's what's funny about this. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2556.88s)]
*  Where motherfuckers think I'm afraid of like a large content creator when I have fucking [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2558.88s)]
*  Congress persons as my ops. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2563.88s)]
*  What the fuck are you saying? [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2566.88s)]
*  Wake up, dumbass. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2568.88s)]
*  Like I can't go back to Turkey. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2570.88s)]
*  Stupid. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2573.88s)]
*  That's kind of funny how I can go there. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2574.88s)]
*  Do you think they'd let me in? [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2576.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2577.88s)]
*  Especially if you want to get hairline reconstruction surgery. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2578.88s)]
*  Hold on now. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2580.88s)]

*  Yeah, dude, dude, dude. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2594.88s)]
*  This is the funniest thing that has ever happened by the way, as a consequence of this after [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-9Lp7nd1g&t=2595.88s)]
