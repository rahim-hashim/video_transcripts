**HasanAbi:** [February 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU)
*  has done more damage to Jews than just about any other American alive time to refer regime [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=0.0s)]
*  change. Oh, by the way, I think Darren Beatty is as Jewish himself just before I think, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=4.2s)]
*  I think he is, is I think Darren Beatty is also Jewish, which by the way, far from the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=10.88s)]
*  first nor the last Jewish Nazi in the Trump administration. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=16.92s)]
*  The new undersecretary for public diplomacy states top public diplomacy official not only [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=22.36s)]
*  denies the Uyghur but appears to applaud it says the U S should sell out Taiwan and China [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=33.16s)]
*  for concessions to Antarctica. What, what the Chinese aren't genocidal. They just objected [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=37.32s)]
*  if we were simply reject we were supremacy. They'll have no problem functioning in Chinese [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=42.2s)]
*  Okay. Wait, what is this? Is this a joke? No, in shot. There is no way. What, what we [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=47.08s)]
*  grew supremacy. That's insane. No, it's gotta be a meme. I've never seen somebody I have [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  literally I've never seen somebody with a globe emoji defend China to a degree where [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=65.32s)]
*  in tankies, dude, like this, this guy is unironically outflanking China defenders. Okay. What the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=71.0s)]
*  fuck? Even like the most hog like defenders of, of Chinese actions in Xinjiang will at [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=82.08s)]
*  least say like, Oh, they're separatist terrorists that like the American CIA armed to disrupt [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=90.64s)]
*  China, Chinese affairs. Right. And they had to be dealt with in by a surveillance state [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=96.76s)]
*  or whatever. Right. I've never heard somebody hit that like liberal tone of being like, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=106.16000000000001s)]
*  this is like saying Hamas is actually advocating for like over Israel. That's why Israel has [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=111.80000000000001s)]
*  to destroy them. Taiwan will inevitably belong to China. It's only a matter of time. It's [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=117.04s)]
*  not worth expending any capital to prevent a visionary station who will recognize this [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=121.52000000000001s)]
*  and make a deal in exchange for acknowledgement of this basic reality, get some serious concessions [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=124.56s)]
*  on Africa and Antarctica. Big deal to be made. If we were, don't like anti-Uyghur racism, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=127.84s)]
*  it must be because they are Uyghur nationalists who think all of China is for Uyghurs only [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=133.12s)]
*  bro. I have literally never heard that. What is he? What is he saying? I have never heard [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=137.4s)]
*  that from even like the most insane Salafist guy who was like a Uyghur separatist is not [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=145.76s)]
*  like all of China belongs to us. What the fuck? I don't think there is a single guy. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  I don't think there is a single Uyghur. You don't understand the entirety of China is [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=160.56s)]
*  ours. Okay. That's like, I don't even think the hogs in China believe that that is what [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=165.51999999999998s)]
*  they're saying. This is awesome. This is a new type of guy chat. You don't understand. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=173.84s)]
*  I've never seen, I've never seen a new type of guy like this before. He's this guy's awesome. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=180.32s)]
*  Amazing. Amazing. The same guy that said this competent white men must be in charge of you [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=187.44s)]
*  on things to work. Unfortunately, our entire national ideology is predicated on cuddling [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=193.51999999999998s)]
*  the feelings of women and minorities and demoralizing the moralizing competent white men. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=197.12s)]
*  This guy's insane. It's real. And he was appointed the ADL. Your fave wrote an article about how he [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=202.32s)]
*  was a Nazi before, but they deleted it just now because they don't want to offend Trump. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=207.28s)]
*  Now that Darren Beatty has been tapped to serve at the state department, the ADL has dutifully [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=211.44s)]
*  removed the press release on their website where they call him a Nazi white supremacist. Dude, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=216.08s)]
*  dude, dude, dude, dude, come on. Come on, dude. He's like, he's also, this is such a weird guy. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=220.8s)]

*  incredibly seemingly very pro China, like pro China to a degree where he's outflanking what the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=238.08s)]
*  Chinese state's statements are on the Uyghurs in general. I've never heard Uyghur supremacy before [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=244.64000000000001s)]
*  and I've seen a variety of different hogs on this issue. I have never heard that before. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=252.08s)]
*  ADL slams white house tapping of ex speechwriter who wrote, wrote at spoke at far right event is [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=258.16s)]
*  outrageous. As someone who consorted with raisin will be considered for a position on the commission [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=262.72s)]

*  government established in 1985, the report on cemeteries, monuments and historic buildings in [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=278.16s)]
*  central Eastern Europe, particularly Hall cost killing and the U.S. government's report on [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=281.92s)]
*  particularly Hall killing sites. Beatty was a white house speechwriter before leaving his [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=286.32s)]
*  post in 2018 following a report that he gave a speech two years earlier at a far right conference [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=291.12s)]

*  Nazi atrocities during the Holocaust. Can we count on you? Patriot DHS FBI, DOD have declared white [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=307.03999999999996s)]
*  supremacy the number one threat and dog gone it. They are right. But did you know the KKK were [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=312.16s)]
*  demon rats? The Nazi were socialist. The Biden was pro-cop 30 years ago. Races move a donation to GOP [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=316.8s)]
*  to fight the real race. This what he hates the ADL and Jonathan Greenblatt. Right now the disgrace [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=325.04s)]
*  water bottle merchant, Jonathan Greenblatt of the ADL is plotting to nuke Twitter from orbit. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=332.32000000000005s)]
*  Disgrace water. Oh my God. He does the watermelon merchant. He does the watermelon merchant memes, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=336.88s)]
*  but for Jonathan Greenblatt, what is happening? What the for those of you who don't know Turks [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=343.6s)]
*  will say, uh, add on is a watermelon merchant. Like he sold, he sold watermelon like Turks that [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=350.24s)]
*  are critical of our Dawn. That's what they'll say. It's the, it's the meme. Disgrace water bottle [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=359.52s)]
*  merchant. Jonathan Greenblatt has done more damage to Jews than just about any other American [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=364.88s)]
*  alive time to refer regime change. Oh, by the way, I think Darren Beatty is as Jewish himself. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=368.96s)]
*  Just before I think, I think he is, I think Darren Beatty is also Jewish, which by the way, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=374.08s)]
*  far from the first nor the last, uh, Jewish Nazi in the Trump administration, obviously Stephen [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=381.92s)]
*  Miller, Donald Trump's second in command when it comes to all of the white nativist anti-immigrant [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=388.72s)]
*  sentiment coming out of the administration. Stephen Miller also is Jewish. Uh, so, you know, just, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=395.04s)]
*  just remember that, uh, being, being Jewish is not stopping some of the Trump administration members [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=402.64000000000004s)]
*  from, uh, being out and about white supremacist Nazis. Darren Beatty, a former Trump speechwriter [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=408.56s)]
*  was controversial appointing due to his ties. The white supremacist linked H L Menken disgraced [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=415.6s)]
*  ADL warns Elon against restoring the following specific accounts. The ADL doesn't have the power [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=421.28000000000003s)]
*  to people think they do. You can really tell the disgrace water bottle merchant. Jonathan Greenblatt [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=424.96000000000004s)]
*  to off the ADL hilariously forced Nick Canada to write a book report on the ADLs. Jonathan Greenblatt. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=429.04s)]
*  Why does he remove ADL from the search bar and type C C C P what C C P openly flouting democratic [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=434.0s)]
*  values. China wants sissy dolls and effeminate men scrub from entertainment industry. The famous [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=440.96000000000004s)]
*  internet globalist American empire is more evil than the CCP. Wait, what FBI is a far greater [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=445.28s)]
*  danger to Americans than the CCP. What is going on Afghanistan situation sets the tone for a series [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=451.44s)]
*  of humiliations for the globalist American empire. Over the course of the 21st century, Taiwan will [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=457.91999999999996s)]
*  belong to CCP in 30 years or less. It's not the CCP pressuring Ilanda sensor. It's the ADL and the [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=462.55999999999995s)]
*  disinformation industries trust and safety mafia of the globalist American empire. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=468.79999999999995s)]
*  CCP sucks and zero COVID sucks, but China is weakest and dumbest attack vector against Apple. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=473.36s)]
*  Dude, what, what is happening? What is going on? This is a new guy. It's a whole new type of guy. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=479.12s)]
*  Like we have in our midst, a white supremacist neo Nazi of Jewish origin and background. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=487.68s)]
*  That is a China simp. Like what, how did that happen? How do you make a guy like that? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=497.84s)]
*  How do you put those four factors into one guy? What is, I don't understand. He has a globe emoji [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=506.0s)]
*  on his Twitter. You sound like a proud ethologist who just discovered a new species of beetle. I did. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=514.48s)]
*  I did because I'm fascinated with politics and the characters that occupy the American government. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=520.8s)]
*  Okay. And when, and as someone who is a documenter of, of the, the curious nature of American [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=530.16s)]
*  politics, when I find an entirely new type of guy that I haven't even envisioned in my mind as a bit, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=538.0799999999999s)]
*  it's a shocking revelation. Okay. It means that the, the, the stupidity of American politics is [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=545.28s)]
*  unmatched. It's gotta be. Yeah. Most of what he's saying are bits probably, but even then I just [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=554.2399999999999s)]
*  don't understand like American anti-China propaganda attacks, CCP narratives, Chinese [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=559.28s)]
*  anti-American propaganda to reinforce his ruling class government narratives. The fact that he [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=564.16s)]
*  writes CCP and not CPC shows that he's just role playing. Yeah. If I told you, if I invented a guy [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=568.56s)]
*  as I do regularly and the guy was a Jewish neo-Nazi who was pro China. Okay. You'd be like, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=575.5999999999999s)]
*  come on, dude. You would just tell me I'm, I'm delusional. Like I've, I've, I've made up a new [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=585.3599999999999s)]
*  guy that is not, is not supposed to exist. Okay. It doesn't make sense, but to be fair, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=591.04s)]
*  I often joke, look, look, I've often joked about the pro NATO voter. And I joked a little too close [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=598.88s)]
*  to the sun because not only was there a pro NATO voter, okay. He actually tried to take action, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=608.9599999999999s)]
*  uh, take matters into his own hands. His name was Ryan Ruth. Okay. After Ryan Ruth, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=618.32s)]
*  after we found out that a guy like that exists in the wild, you know, I ate some humble pie [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=625.36s)]
*  and I realized that maybe I should be more careful with the guys I'm inventing. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=633.2s)]
*  So this is not shocking me any longer. Okay. Not everything deserves a reaction. Sometimes you just [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=637.12s)]
*  sit back and you watch. Okay. It was a Ryan. Ruth was a pivotal moment for me. It was a learning [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=643.92s)]
*  moment for me. And since then I've learned to just kick it. You know, if things are [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=649.5999999999999s)]
*  out of your power, you just got to sometimes watch it. BD spoke, spoke at a conference of the [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=658.88s)]
*  r*****g extremist HL Mencken club where he participated in a discussion with Brimelow, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=664.0799999999999s)]
*  the creator of the races and anti-immigrant vet website. V as we have said before, there's no [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=668.24s)]
*  place in any presidential administration or government commission for an individual who [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=673.28s)]
*  would attend and participate such a well-known event. It is absolutely outrageous that someone [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=676.0799999999999s)]
*  who consorted with r*****g would even be considered for a position in the commission devoted to [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=680.48s)]
*  preserving h*****g costs and morals in Europe. And another tweet BD wrote the ADL is truly the [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=684.8s)]
*  enemy of the people. I mean, he's not wrong about the ADL, but you know, not the best guy to be [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wte4zotMvmU&t=689.76s)]
