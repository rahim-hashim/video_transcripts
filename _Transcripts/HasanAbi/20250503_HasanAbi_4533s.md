# What REALLY Happened In Yesterday's Debate | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [May 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA)
*  in the aftermath of the debate where I said like I've I felt [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=0.0s)]
*  like I myself where I did succumb to the whims of I did [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3.36s)]
*  succumb to the whims of of of Ethan making this about petty [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=10.96s)]
*  drama. But in terms of like getting in terms of getting [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=16.2s)]
*  Ethan to admit certain things I that basically destroy a lot of [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=20.36s)]
*  what he had said prior. But yeah, we're going to do we're [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=27.84s)]
*  going to do a little bit of a we're going to be doing a [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=37.04s)]
*  little bit of a debate a recap and then and fun day as well. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=40.4s)]
*  But like come on, let's be real. Let's be real. Let's be real. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=45.6s)]
*  You expected this to happen. I mean, I have to do a recap, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=50.4s)]
*  right? Like I'm crazy. We had 120,000 people tuning in here [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  yesterday, 130 almost and another 100 K on the other side [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=57.12s)]
*  asmongold. Like this is this is the thing that a lot of people [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  actually watched. It was the most unemployed Super Bowl of all [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  time. And obviously I'm going to be talking about that. I'm [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=67.75999999999999s)]
*  going to be talking about some aspects. I do feel apologetic [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=72.0s)]
*  because I do feel in some ways I feel kind of sad because I like [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=76.64s)]
*  my goal yesterday is you guys probably noticed or you probably [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=84.64s)]
*  heard ahead of time because I kept saying it over and over [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=90.4s)]
*  again was to have a conversation around to have a conversation [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=93.68s)]
*  around the actual the actual situation that matters, which is [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=99.2s)]
*  Israel's mass starvation campaign. And also, you know, how [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=104.64s)]
*  how my former park ex co-host is like handled himself throughout [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=110.56s)]
*  this process with like an endless sea of harassment, right? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=113.84s)]
*  Endless sea of harassment towards people that don't have the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=118.56s)]
*  same perspective that he does. And I guess the apology that I [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=121.84s)]
*  want to start off with is that, you know, I think I, I should [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=126.56s)]
*  have redirected it further. I think I should have redirected [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=130.0s)]
*  the conversation back to the issues that matter a little bit [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  further. And I think I should have, I don't know, I had to, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=135.28s)]
*  there were on the spot moments. There were on the spot moments [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=139.52s)]
*  where I, I stood, I stood 10 toes down and certainly [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=143.2s)]
*  redirected the conversation, but there were definitely [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=149.04s)]
*  instances where I just like kind of let him get away with [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=151.51999999999998s)]
*  saying things and then moving on, even though he was very [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=154.0s)]
*  clearly lying about those things. And there I had evidence, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  I had the information, I could have just pulled it up, but it [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=161.76s)]
*  was very difficult to pull up some of the information. He [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=163.6s)]
*  didn't want me to like show my side, all that, all that much. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=165.67999999999998s)]
*  Ultimately, he did most of the work, making himself look a [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=170.8s)]
*  certain way to the onlookers. But I do believe that, I do [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  believe that like, this is like, I believe personally, because [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=178.96s)]
*  I have a very high bar here for myself that I, I wanted to, I [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=182.8s)]
*  wanted to clear in terms of like, actually, in terms of [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=187.76000000000002s)]
*  actually getting to the issues that matter and not letting [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=190.72000000000003s)]
*  anything get away with by, you know, saying things like that [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=193.84s)]
*  he is actually against the side and that he is actually [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=197.68s)]
*  admitting to it being because his behavior did not make sense. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=202.16s)]
*  His behavior was inconsistent. You know what I mean? And there [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=206.72s)]
*  was also some issues that I wanted to get to the conflation [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=210.07999999999998s)]
*  of anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism that we didn't actually [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=212.24s)]
*  talk about as well. But I don't know what it looked like on the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=215.12s)]
*  other side. I don't know what it looked like on the other side, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=219.2s)]
*  but on my side, even when I'm looking back at the clips, like [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=221.44s)]
*  my audio was not great. So that's something that I have to [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=224.56s)]
*  also definitely take care of when we're doing zoom. It's [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=227.44s)]
*  impossible to change the audio. So I cranked up, wait, it's [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=231.2s)]
*  probably still blown out. Actually. I cranked up my gain [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=235.84s)]
*  so I could like fix my audio on my end, but like zoom bricked [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=239.12s)]
*  it completely, which was really annoying. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=243.12s)]
*  Lamar audio, not great. Lamar. None of that happened. You got [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=246.64000000000001s)]
*  torched in that debate. Oh, I assume that there's going to be [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=249.76s)]
*  a lot of people like this that come in today, of course, and [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=252.56s)]
*  say stuff like this. Obviously that's not the case. And we know [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  what you're doing, big dog, but thank you. You'll be, you'll be [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=258.72s)]
*  seeing a lot of, you'll be seeing a lot of these, you know, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=261.76s)]
*  as a long time fan of yours and also a, a person that is like [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=265.04s)]
*  totally aware of everything that's going on in Israel. I do [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=270.96s)]
*  think that you've lost me as a fan. And it's like, dude, we [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=274.72s)]
*  know, like we know what you're doing. You're it's fine. You [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=277.92s)]
*  know, you can, you can keep presenting it this way, but I [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=282.16s)]
*  hope Dan here, he did your message. I want to give him the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=286.16s)]
*  benefit of the doubt, but I don't think he did. I actually [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=289.04s)]
*  don't know. I actually don't know what is Copium. Copium is [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=291.44s)]
*  what these people are doing in the chat when they come in to [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=295.52000000000004s)]
*  be like, can you believe tech tone acted like he had an [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=298.72s)]
*  opinion? Yeah, exactly. You will see, you will see a lot of [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=302.0s)]
*  people that have no interest in politics whatsoever. We once [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=306.64000000000004s)]
*  again, who are apolitical in nature, apolitical in nature, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=310.72s)]
*  come out against this issue. You should have come prepared with [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=314.0s)]
*  video clips. You can't just wing it again. I did. I had video [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=317.36s)]
*  clips. Yeah. What is this? There's probably a reason why all [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=319.6s)]
*  the people who think even won the debate are either already [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=322.8s)]
*  committed Zionist lovers or anime gaming addicts who spend [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=325.12s)]
*  the 10 years obsessing over being too many black people in [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=327.04s)]
*  video games. Yeah, exactly. I mean, they, they also said [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=329.12s)]
*  similar things about Sam Cedar as well. And the Sam Cedar [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=332.96000000000004s)]
*  conversation was actually much more amicable because Ethan did [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=335.44000000000005s)]
*  not want to blow his load on him in the same way. And Sam [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=340.0s)]
*  could just easily be like, I don't care about these things in [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=343.44s)]
*  a way that I tried to also do, but he would not give a shit. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=346.8s)]
*  He would not let me move on to a topic that actually matters. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=350.96s)]
*  You know, some in as Ms. Chat want you to be deported. I'm [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=356.56s)]
*  more American than they are, baby. Yeah. I think a real [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=360.08s)]
*  moderator would have made it a lot better. Dan was not really [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=363.04s)]
*  doing any moderating and had your send to clips to Ethan to [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=365.04s)]
*  be on screen. Yeah. Yeah. The structure of it wasn't great. I [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=367.52s)]
*  mean, all things considered, I don't think that it was, you [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=370.56s)]
*  know, I don't think that I did a poor job. Make no mistake. I'm [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=373.68s)]
*  just being even in the most hyper critical, even, even being [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=376.71999999999997s)]
*  the most hyper critical of myself, regardless of the way [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=381.44s)]
*  that Ethan presented himself, I still wanted to do something [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=385.2s)]
*  here. And the thing I wanted to do was like not cheap in this [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=390.15999999999997s)]
*  discussion. And I basically said that as well in the aftermath [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=392.79999999999995s)]
*  of the debate where I said, like, I've, I felt like I [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=396.64s)]
*  suited myself where I did succumb to the whims of, I did [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=399.12s)]
*  succumb to the whims of, of, of Ethan making this about petty [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=406.08s)]
*  drama. But in terms of like getting, in terms of getting [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=411.36s)]
*  Ethan to admit certain things, I, that, that basically [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=415.44s)]
*  destroy a lot of what he had said prior. I mean, I'm diving [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=420.32s)]
*  into it. I didn't even blast off yet. Let me just blast off [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=426.16s)]
*  and then we'll get into it. But like in terms of personal news, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=428.40000000000003s)]
*  I didn't really do much last night. I got myself some ice [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=431.12s)]
*  cream. I treated myself to some ice cream. I even got a cone [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=434.16s)]
*  and, and what do you call it? I watched fear and [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=439.12s)]
*  free run is interesting. It's starting to finally get [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=445.6s)]
*  interesting. Did you sleep? Okay. Yeah. I slept like a baby, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=448.24s)]
*  but fear and started and finally get interesting because of the [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=451.20000000000005s)]
*  introduction of demons. So I have a lot of thoughts on it, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=454.64s)]
*  but I have to keep watching to make a better assessment on [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=457.84s)]
*  what's going on because it's like, I don't normally love the [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=460.71999999999997s)]
*  pure evil dynamics. And maybe I'm misunderstanding if it's [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=463.28s)]
*  like a pure evil versus good dynamic happening there, but it [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=465.68s)]
*  is interesting and we will take a look at it, but I can see why [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=469.59999999999997s)]
*  people see it as like fascist agit prop because it, it almost [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=473.52s)]
*  feels like the poem that Donald Trump always use about [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=478.96s)]
*  immigrants saying like, this is their nature and there is not [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=482.4s)]
*  much you can do about it. Yeah. I saw the, the Chris [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=486.0s)]

*  he thinks it's a joke from the Simpsons. Oh, okay. I mean, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=517.0400000000001s)]
*  there was a lot of, there was a lot of moments where he was just [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=520.24s)]
*  like making erroneous claims and then walking them back and [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=522.88s)]

*  a, like a vicious anti-Semite. And it's such a funny thing to [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=554.96s)]
*  be like, like, I don't think, first of all, it's not something [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=559.5200000000001s)]

*  something that I've joked about. It's something that I've joked [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=566.08s)]
*  about with him. Right? So it's like, if I'm having a heated [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=567.9200000000001s)]
*  debate with like a neo-Nazi with someone who is truly an [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=573.12s)]

*  like myself and that person have shared as a shared [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=585.84s)]

*  how you expected they be? Yeah. Anyway, let's we blast it off. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=599.04s)]
*  Like some of this stuff just simply doesn't make sense. If [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=604.48s)]
*  he thinks I'm like this vicious anti-Semite worse than Candace [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=607.04s)]
*  Owens and Nick Fuentes, which is what he said, then the way he [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=609.92s)]
*  is talking to me doesn't make sense. You know what I mean? If [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=614.16s)]
*  this is the case, then he has to have more evidence than I [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=617.04s)]
*  suspect you bought this incredibly popular anime sword [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=620.64s)]
*  that you did two years ago when we had a podcast together as a [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=625.28s)]
*  way to be anti-Semitic. But also as of two days ago, I didn't [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=632.16s)]
*  consider you to be anti-Semitic after the same Cedar debate. But [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=635.6s)]
*  as of this very moment, after the conversation that we had, I [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=638.72s)]
*  have now decided you are anti-Semitic. Like that's a [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=642.56s)]
*  ridiculous assessment. Like none of that makes sense. The way [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=646.4799999999999s)]
*  he was presenting himself basically did not make sense with [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=649.4399999999999s)]
*  the arguments that he was presenting. What's sad is the [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=654.0s)]
*  amount of drama slop tubers who clearly don't cover the make [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=657.8399999999999s)]
*  YouTube vids about this debate, not highlighting the fact that [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=659.92s)]
*  how gross these comments were. Yeah, that's what's most likely [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=662.4799999999999s)]
*  going to happen. And it's ironic because like this is something [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=666.4s)]
*  that I was arguing against and something that I don't want, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=670.4s)]
*  right? In terms of like all the slop tubers that cover this kind [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=675.92s)]
*  of stuff exclusively from the fuck Hassan tip overzealous is a [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=680.24s)]
*  really good video on this that we watched on the broadcast. It's [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=684.64s)]
*  not as odd as you think, because that was what was a direct [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=687.76s)]
*  attempt to try and find an explodable self-conscious target [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=690.3199999999999s)]
*  that would upset and tilt you. But he could describe as only a [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=692.72s)]
*  liar as well. Yeah, it's I don't know. I go back and forth on [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=696.08s)]
*  thinking whether or not Ethan genuinely and legitimately [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=702.88s)]
*  thinks I'm anti-Semitic because of the way he's because of the [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=706.72s)]
*  way he's presented himself. I think he's just, I still land on [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=710.64s)]
*  I still land on him assuming, I mean him hating me and then just [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=715.84s)]
*  like wanting there to be a good reason for him to hate me beyond [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=720.8000000000001s)]
*  the fact that his fan base turned on him and it hurt his [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=724.4s)]
*  feelings because they did not see him as like an intellectual [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=727.84s)]
*  beacon who had a who had the morally correct position on [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=731.76s)]
*  Israel Palestine and they didn't treat him with a bit of grace [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=736.24s)]
*  and baby him through the process because the situation was was [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=739.92s)]
*  direct and the conflict in and of itself. The genocide is so [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=744.16s)]
*  severe that it's like impossible for people to not have an [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=748.72s)]
*  unnuanced and very straightforward opinion on it. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=752.64s)]
*  And it's understandable because this is the one thing that is [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=755.5999999999999s)]
*  understandable to have a black and white perspective on right. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=758.8s)]
*  So that's what it is, right? Like that's I think like everything [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=762.0s)]
*  else is just seasoning on top of that where he just wants to he [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=765.3599999999999s)]
*  wants to make this argument presentable and not come across [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=769.1199999999999s)]
*  as like selfish and obsessive. And I don't think he laid out a [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=772.2399999999999s)]
*  convincing case for that. And my goal yesterday was to first and [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=776.2399999999999s)]
*  foremost bring it back to the issues and talk about the damage [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=782.0s)]
*  that he has caused by consistently consistently identifying [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=784.48s)]
*  pro-Palestinian content creators who have been critical of [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=790.96s)]
*  Ethan and his coverage as as anti-semites that are worthy of [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=793.36s)]
*  deplatforming through the silly things that they brought [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=797.44s)]
*  forward through the silly things that he brought forward. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=799.92s)]
*  He wanted to reconcile with you, but in a way that makes him [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=802.64s)]
*  look good. Basically you doing concessions is what I got. I [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=804.4s)]
*  think he likes you, but he's hurt. No, I don't think so. I [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=806.64s)]
*  think he despises me and he said it. See, he said as much in [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=809.52s)]
*  the conversation. He said it multiple times. What is this? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=812.72s)]
*  Yeah, he I mean, this is not even a debate tag. This is an [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=816.4s)]
*  incredibly childish thing that he did, which I think did not [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=820.3199999999999s)]
*  present him in a good light at all. So I don't know why anyone [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=823.52s)]
*  would look to this and be like he was so composed. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=826.8s)]
*  What you don't know what I'm talking about. Yeah, it was on [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=828.72s)]
*  the list. Your line. Yeah, I got a I got a free roll from a [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=833.04s)]
*  friend of mine. I still wear it every now and then. And you're [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=837.92s)]
*  so wow. Who knew what like none of these are none of these are [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=840.3199999999999s)]
*  arguments. None of these are counter arguments. It was just [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=845.28s)]
*  like it was very interesting. Like it was it was basically just [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=847.52s)]
*  like a like childlike mockery and I was fairly composed through [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=850.9599999999999s)]
*  it. Like I didn't really eat the bait because I think he was [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=857.52s)]
*  just trying to get something out of me in most of these [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=860.24s)]
*  situations. And if you noticed if you notice throughout the [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=863.28s)]
*  conversation there are moments where I unwind. Okay. But if you [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=866.64s)]
*  notice the only moments where I unwind is not when he's like [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=872.3199999999999s)]
*  calling me an anti-semite or whatever or doing petty drama or [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=875.04s)]
*  this kind of shit. It's when he's saying something about [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=878.08s)]
*  Israel that I think is like repulsive or inconsistent with [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=881.12s)]
*  other things that he said about Israel that make no sense when [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=886.0s)]
*  you consider the past year long conquest to de platform pro [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=890.4s)]
*  Palestinian voices. And that was the only time I was like dude [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=895.44s)]
*  shut up. He was he was trying to provoke me and I didn't really [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=900.96s)]
*  eat that at all. And I suspect maybe I suspect maybe the ad [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=904.6400000000001s)]
*  live stuff was to get me to like pop back at him. I don't know [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=911.5200000000001s)]
*  why he also like made fun of me stuttering once like dude I don't [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=915.0400000000001s)]
*  make fun of you for for having turrets that would be ableist [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=920.72s)]
*  right like that is an incredibly ableist thing to do even even [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=924.56s)]
*  if he even if this is like a totally different totally [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=928.7199999999999s)]
*  different way to approach it right like you're the way that [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=933.28s)]
*  you're carrying yourself is manic and crazy not because of [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=937.1199999999999s)]
*  your turrets but instead it's because of the things you're [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=941.76s)]
*  saying. And I think potentially he was trying to to get me he [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=945.3599999999999s)]
*  was trying to goad me maybe to like responding kind so he could [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=952.0s)]

*  in general I just didn't expect how bad faith he would get but [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1006.88s)]
*  it doesn't matter because like people who watched it who [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1009.6s)]
*  already had preconceived notions of of Israel Palestine that [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1013.28s)]

*  This is an interesting position that American liberals [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1030.88s)]
*  have because of the endless amount of Islamophobic [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1034.08s)]

*  that's basically what it is and there's a lot of weaponization [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1083.84s)]

*  deliberately. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1091.36s)]
*  Yeah people go IDF and Hamas are in the wrong it's not a hard [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1092.32s)]
*  concept but it actually is an incredibly unnuanced position to [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1095.76s)]
*  take because no they're not both in the wrong it's not a hard [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1100.8799999999999s)]
*  concept one is a significantly worse group than the other the [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1104.72s)]
*  IDF being the significantly worse group. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1110.8s)]
*  Okay that's it and the reality of the matter is many people [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1114.48s)]
*  don't want to recognize that even though it is objectively [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1121.04s)]
*  true the IDF is far worse group than Hamas ever could be whether [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1125.28s)]
*  it is the logistical prowess that they have or even the fact [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1132.72s)]
*  that with all of the overwhelming power that they have they have [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1136.8s)]
*  done so much destruction to the Palestinian population a [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1140.8s)]
*  civilian population this is why I kept saying over and over [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1145.12s)]
*  again this is why I kept repeating over and over again [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1149.68s)]
*  that like this is like Hamas would not exist if the IDF did [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1153.1200000000001s)]
*  not exist Hamas would not exist if the if the Israeli state [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1157.92s)]
*  wasn't maintaining an apartheid state that is incredibly [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1161.2s)]
*  violent dude him saying that if Anne Frank fought back or killed [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1164.64s)]
*  a Nazi would have changed his opinion of her for the worse that [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1167.52s)]
*  was absolutely insane I know but even when Libs decide that [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1169.44s)]
*  much later a liberation movement was a good thing they [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1172.64s)]
*  also whitewash it yeah that too I just got here so sorry if you [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1174.4s)]
*  want over can you explain your views on permissibility of [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1178.0s)]
*  using unrelated citizens as prisoners did you mean as a good [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1180.72s)]
*  war tactic no I know I'm not saying it's a good war tactic at [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1183.04s)]
*  all I'm saying that there is no other way to take over a ship [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1187.2s)]
*  without you know taking over the the people that are operating [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1191.44s)]
*  on the ship the treatment of the hostages is what matters in [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1196.16s)]
*  this situation and yeah it probably would have been better [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1199.12s)]
*  if they had released the the ship crew beforehand but I think [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1202.8s)]
*  the reason why they are actually taking over ships and [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1208.32s)]
*  disrupting commercial shipping and also combating against [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1212.0s)]
*  fighting against even the American Navy that's trying to [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1217.6s)]
*  disrupt that operation thousands of miles away from the [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1220.0s)]
*  American border by the way the reason why I think that that is [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1223.84s)]
*  it's not the best thing to do but it's also the only thing [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1228.72s)]
*  that they have in their arsenal so yes I think that ultimately I [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1232.8000000000002s)]
*  think that ultimately and I think and many people will agree [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1238.0800000000002s)]
*  with this unless they are totally operating on the [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1240.8000000000002s)]
*  boundaries of like well these guys are bad and wrong because [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1245.1200000000001s)]
*  they're scary and America told me so if you look at it from the [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1247.8400000000001s)]
*  framework of if you look at it from the framework of like [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1253.04s)]
*  genocide and who is resisting against genocide and what they [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1255.92s)]

*  absolutely that they absolutely would have to come to terms with [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1263.3600000000001s)]
*  the fact that what the who these are doing in this framework [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1266.64s)]
*  resisting against genocide is correct it is morally correct [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1269.68s)]
*  even if some of the methods actually fall short of a standard [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1272.72s)]
*  that you fall short of your own personal standards and mine as [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1277.2s)]
*  well I hope that that 14 month subscriber understands my [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1281.2s)]
*  position on this because there is no there is no comparison [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1284.32s)]
*  between the Israeli occupying force and Hamas especially [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1288.3999999999999s)]
*  because Hamas is a militant resistance group against the [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1291.84s)]
*  apartheid that is maintained by the Israeli occupying force [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1295.36s)]

*  argument Ethan was trying to use was unbelievable yeah and the [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1301.9199999999998s)]
*  reality of the matter is no matter what happens you will [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1305.28s)]

*  okay in terms of the areas where my biggest i guess quote unquote w's [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1502.88s)]
*  were uh there are i feel i believe around seven if not more [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1507.92s)]
*  instances where ethan basically uh agreed to my position and even [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1512.0800000000002s)]
*  went as far as to apologize for things that he has done in the [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1516.0s)]
*  past so uh that's fairly significant most of it was from the [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1519.0400000000002s)]
*  context uh nuke and i think that you know that's that's not [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1524.0s)]
*  something to just like uh lightly cast aside especially considering that [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1531.2s)]
*  this is supposed to be his pivotal work that he put a lot of effort and [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1535.6000000000001s)]
*  research into um there's also obviously many many concessions he gave which i [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1538.16s)]
*  think don't make sense uh when you when you factor in the way he has [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1544.24s)]
*  behaved in the past uh in the past 15 months of this ongoing [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1548.0800000000002s)]
*  uh genocide but there was uh there was also a bunch of there was also a bunch [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1554.0800000000002s)]
*  of instances where he basically admitted yes yeah like i was wrong and i smeared [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1560.64s)]
*  you which i thought was interesting i didn't know really how to deal with [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1563.5200000000002s)]
*  that but i don't think anybody actually cares on on team ethan um it didn't come [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1567.6000000000001s)]
*  across like you can genuinely give those concessions to you and instead only set [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1573.92s)]
*  it to move on since he kept saying he was bored of you yeah but like there are [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1576.5600000000002s)]
*  so many moments where he just like instantly contradicted himself where he [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1580.0s)]
*  was like well i don't destiny directly okay you talked to his podcast co-host [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1584.4s)]
*  who was engaged in a blackmail operation against people who have like come out [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1588.88s)]
*  against destiny in his like sex pest case right like what do you mean he uses [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1592.24s)]
*  that same community he's his best friend uh that is not like you've you've worked [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1599.2s)]
*  alongside him on numerous occasions like or even with the adl example like or even [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1606.0800000000002s)]
*  the cps call i was like dude you know my position on this i don't believe the cps [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1612.48s)]
*  call in and of itself is appropriate i don't think anyone should be calling cps on you [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1617.04s)]
*  or anybody for that matter just because they don't like a content creator but like can [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1620.72s)]
*  you please explain to me what my role in this is and he kept and and then he couldn't really [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1625.44s)]
*  tie it back to me in any capacity aside from well you a week ago pulled up a snark subreddit so i [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1631.52s)]
*  said okay can you tell me how who called cps on you and he had nothing he he had to basically [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1637.92s)]
*  admit and this is a pivotal part of his like victimhood structure was the fact that the my [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1643.92s)]
*  fans had called cps on him that that's what he had said right like over and over again and he [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1650.0s)]
*  somehow tried to tie it back to me and and and what's interesting about that is he he had to [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1654.8000000000002s)]
*  basically admit that he had no evidence whatsoever that it was actually uh coming from my community [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1661.8400000000001s)]
*  at all or even the snark subreddits so and that was oh by the way this chat are saying honestly [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1668.32s)]
*  your only l was calling uh hila getting him to admit hila is a terrorist or something no the [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1675.9199999999998s)]
*  point the reason why i brought that up was to expose the double standard to showcase ethans [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1682.24s)]
*  islamophobia ethans racism in this process because it plays a big role i don't i don't have the [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1687.12s)]
*  attitude and i tried to explain what hila had done was a night raid and the only reason why i know [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1693.28s)]
*  what that looks like what a night raid looks like and what the actual express purpose of the israeli [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1700.16s)]
*  occupying force is in conducting those night raids is because of breaking the silence breaking the [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1704.4s)]
*  silence is an israeli uh philanthropic organization an israeli organization that works against the [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1709.52s)]
*  occupation and it's comprised entirely of former israeli occupying force veterans so of course i [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1716.32s)]
*  have interviewed people who have been a part of the israeli occupying forces as well as well as [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1722.24s)]
*  interviewed people that have been conscientious objectors so i don't actually hold people's [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1727.52s)]
*  social conditioning when they're young against them i think that would be silly it is entirely [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1733.1200000000001s)]
*  the opposite of my worldview it goes against my i believe everyone can change their attitude everyone [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1738.72s)]
*  can change their mentality my frustration was my frustration was uh twofold one that uh he on the [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1745.68s)]
*  one hand washed that washed that aside by saying she was 19 is forced mandatory conscription but [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1755.1200000000001s)]
*  then also simultaneously would turn around and smear a dude and call him a fucking terrorist which [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1760.96s)]
*  a lot of people still keep claiming over and over again if you want to get it right you can get it [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1765.28s)]
*  right i don't have an issue with even if he was a houthi i would not have an issue with uh [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1769.76s)]
*  interviewing him for the record as i've said over and over again but yeah i know you're trying to [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1774.24s)]
*  say how you can you call rishada terrors for instance but not he'll let you get him to [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1779.44s)]
*  understand the double standard but it seems like you were just trying to call hila terrors i think [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1782.16s)]
*  no because i did say exactly those words but i guess it gets lost in the conversation when the [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1785.52s)]
*  impact point is getting ethan to say that his wife could be considered a terrorist just to move on [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1790.64s)]
*  what is this getting love on tiktok hasan yeah there is definitely a lot of that but it doesn't [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1798.32s)]
*  matter i think he has been using judy as a shield to deflect any criticism of his beliefs and him [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1804.32s)]
*  calling you anti-semitic is going to mean nothing when it's used against actual legitimate anti-semites [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1808.08s)]
*  yeah [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1813.04s)]
*  so yeah and he asked me how i feel about that as well and i tried to explain to him like [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1818.0s)]
*  i don't hold people's past actions against them as long as they have learned and have grown from [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1823.68s)]
*  their previous positions because i understand as someone who lives in the western world as someone [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1831.1200000000001s)]
*  who lives in america i understand how powerful social conditioning is i understand how someone [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1835.2s)]
*  who's 18 years old will join the israeli i the israeli defense force from their perspective [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1841.76s)]
*  right i get that i totally understand that i understand how someone can find themselves [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1847.68s)]
*  in that position but through the cruelty of their actions like they should or at least [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1853.2s)]
*  10 20 years down the line they don't still maintain the position that what they did was good [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1858.5600000000002s)]
*  and that still continuously defend the israeli occupying force that's my issue and for people [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1863.92s)]
*  who say why don't you just like off the rip call her a terrorist or anything like that [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1870.24s)]
*  um i i need you to understand something like i'm talking first of all i'm talking to an audience of [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1875.52s)]
*  primarily westerners who don't even care about the issue at hand who simultaneously consider this to [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1882.08s)]
*  be a genocide because it is but also only care about the drama aspect of it revolving around a [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1887.2s)]
*  content creator and his own personal feelings so clearly in order to in order to try to [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1892.3999999999999s)]
*  pierce that veil in order to try to penetrate into their collective consciousness like [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1899.04s)]
*  there is a way to go about it okay yeah all of this just don't kidnap innocent people talk [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1903.6s)]
*  that he look line not admit to partaking in an illegal raid that led to the kidnapping of [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1908.56s)]
*  innocent people or did i dream that yeah that's like he was like well we don't know what they did [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1911.76s)]
*  we don't know what the person did and it's like well the point is they're not supposed to be there [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1915.84s)]
*  at all so even if that person had like it like it doesn't make sense within the within the [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1920.48s)]
*  logical confines that ethan has cultivated where he believes that [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1927.84s)]
*  according to international law that settlers are valid military targets but also simultaneously [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1933.84s)]
*  it is totally justifiable to do a raid on a palestinian home because who knows maybe they [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1940.96s)]
*  actually what exercise they valid military target is that you know exercise violence against a valid [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1945.92s)]
*  military target like that doesn't make sense that is an inconsistency that he never has to address [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1951.36s)]
*  and that is what i was trying to get him to address do you understand because if you believe that [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1957.36s)]
*  settlers are valid military targets you also have to believe that the illegal occupation of the [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1962.8799999999999s)]
*  west bank is completely unconditionally unjustifiable and therefore any kind of military [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1969.4399999999998s)]
*  action that you take against someone who is exercising their international human rights law [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1975.28s)]
*  of militant resistance against a valid military target as he has said as he has said then you know [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1982.48s)]
*  that's illegal it's the the actions not of the palestinian in that situation are illegal the [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1990.0s)]
*  actions of of the israeli occupying force are illegal do you think they'll ever stop with this [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1994.56s)]
*  ongoing bullshit no because i think this is like about view counts for him in general people even [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=1999.36s)]
*  left this interview struggling with the conversation around sexual assault in relation to the conflict [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2004.32s)]
*  so that was the so those are the two l's that i'm gonna i'm gonna talk about one the conversation [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2007.9199999999998s)]
*  revolving mass sexual assault systematic sexual assault directed by hamas i will be talking about [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2014.1599999999999s)]
*  that extensively and then the other conversation that i think got lost in the weeds was i feel like [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2020.48s)]
*  we talked past one another on the avish lame point on the on the point about [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2027.52s)]
*  the nakba being compared to expulsion and also voluntary migration of jewish people [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2034.96s)]
*  from surrounding arab nations and i think on that one we definitely talked past one another [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2041.68s)]
*  one another and i want to like go back and and relitigate it or i want to go back and understand [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2047.92s)]
*  ethan's position one of the main points of contention here always is the fact that [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2052.96s)]
*  ethan will present something um ethan will present my position in the worst possible framework [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2058.4s)]
*  to make it seem as though i don't believe certain things that he's bringing forward [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2067.04s)]
*  and the reality of the matter is there's never been a moment where i have denied that there has [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2072.16s)]
*  not been expulsions of jewish people or pogroms of jewish people especially in the aftermath of [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2077.28s)]
*  1948 especially in the aftermath of the nakba this is something that i have talked about as well [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2083.1200000000003s)]
*  over and over and over again but the problem um but but the problem with the ethans framework [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2089.52s)]
*  wasn't that uh there's two problems with these framework one that he believes that i'm denying [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2095.92s)]
*  that uh jews were were harmed in this process in surrounding arab nations i'm not denying that at [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2101.6s)]
*  all what i'm simply stating is that the trigger point being the trigger point of this all is the [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2108.48s)]
*  nakba which is a planned and executed deliberate ethnic cleansing campaign which is done by one [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2115.68s)]
*  singular ideology as opposed to the reaction of that from surrounding arab nations cannot be [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2123.04s)]
*  attributed cannot be compared to one another especially when you factor in the reality that [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2130.8s)]
*  some of these surrounding arab nations and menna nations weren't even autonomous at that point [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2135.6000000000004s)]
*  they were literally under the rulership of vichy france at a certain point or they were literally [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2142.0s)]
*  under the rulership of of or under the control of england at a certain point so the notion that [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2147.04s)]
*  these countries had this organic or uh you know collective hive-minded anti-semitism that manifested [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2155.2s)]
*  and exploded is is utterly ridiculous in comparison to a planned and deliberate mass [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2163.3599999999997s)]
*  expulsion campaign and it and the palestinians had nothing to do with the surrounding arab nations in [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2170.3199999999997s)]
*  any in any way shape or form regardless these are totally separate countries but the reality of the [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2177.2s)]
*  matter is he could not see beyond the fact that they were arabs he could not see beyond the fact [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2183.04s)]
*  that these are all arab nations and they were all arabs that did this it was the anti-semitism of [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2188.88s)]
*  arabs that caused jews to become zionist which i think is ridiculous he was reacting as if trauma [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2193.12s)]
*  is binary yes no rather than realizing the scale and scope of these things are vastly different [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2200.32s)]
*  as well as avoid talking about who was responsible for the infliction of those traumas as well yeah [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2204.08s)]
*  and i think a bastardization of avish lame's perspective to drive home that point because he [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2208.64s)]
*  like got someone to basically clip from his latest book and his commentary key points that that make [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2215.2s)]
*  it seem as though avish lame's ultimate perspective is that like arabs became arabs are forced to [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2224.0s)]
*  become zionist is is i think a great misunderstanding of a historian that of a historian that has [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2229.52s)]
*  spent most of his work talking against that okay like his his big point is yeah you know how there's [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2237.4399999999996s)]
*  a double holocaust or a double genocide theory that a lot of neo-nazis immediately implemented [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2244.24s)]
*  in the aftermath of world war two this is known by historic like scholars of history theory that [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2251.12s)]
*  like the ussr also did a genocide and actually their genocides were far larger in scale and [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2257.2s)]
*  number and therefore they are the worst party in world war two it's a way to try to whitewash [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2262.4s)]
*  and launder the reputation of germany nazi germany a similar perspective took place in [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2268.4s)]
*  ethan's commentary which is the double knockpa almost yeah here is spencer gab saying i read the [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2274.96s)]
*  first two chapters of the three worlds after the debate obviously literally describes the fallacy [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2281.84s)]
*  of a double knockpa like this the purpose of this narrative is to create a false symmetry between the [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2285.6s)]
*  fate of the two communities the narrative is not history it is propaganda of the victors [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2289.12s)]
*  read this excerpt highlighted from the same avish lame ethan misquoted yeah this is from three [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2294.7999999999997s)]
*  worlds memoirs of an arab jew and this is from the prologue it is impossible to make sense of [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2299.7599999999998s)]
*  this history without the regional context post 1950 arab jewish or mizrahi history becomes a part [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2304.96s)]
*  of israel's history and as such is divorced from his wider regional environment zionists are only [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2309.12s)]
*  interested obsessively interested in the first phase of the arab jewish history they are profoundly [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2314.56s)]
*  uninterested in the second interested in the first phase is driven not by the search for truth [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2318.64s)]
*  but by propaganda need to portray the jews as victims of the endemic arab persecution [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2323.52s)]
*  a portrayal that is then used to justify israel's own atrocious treatment of the palestinians [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2328.24s)]
*  a rich fascinating and multi-dimensional history is thus reduced to the quest for ammunition [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2333.2s)]
*  ammunition to use in the ongoing war against the palestinians this trend reached its climax with [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2338.0s)]
*  the manufacture of the narrative of the jewish knockpa according to this narrative the forced [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2342.96s)]
*  exodus of 850 000 jews from arab countries after 1948 amounted to a catastrophe a jewish knockba [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2347.36s)]
*  at least on par with if not more devastating in its consequences than the palestinian knockba [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2355.6800000000003s)]
*  variously called the forgotten exodus the forced exodus or the double exodus the purpose of this [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2361.52s)]
*  narrative is to create a false symmetry between the fate of the two communities this narrative is [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2367.0400000000004s)]
*  not history it is propaganda of the victors there has never been a moment where i have [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2371.12s)]
*  discounted that there was anti-semitism that took place especially during the pan arabic [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2377.6s)]
*  nationalist movements where a lot of these arabic countries that had aligned themselves with europe [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2384.24s)]
*  and clino pat the time in an effort to develop sovereignty and nation states even though they [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2391.7599999999998s)]
*  previously were under the rule of the empire for example they did do that and that was a big part [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2396.72s)]
*  of this this this pan arabic nationalist movement that created these nation states to begin with [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2402.48s)]
*  nation states whose boundaries were carefully constructed by western superpowers okay guys if [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2408.7999999999997s)]
*  it blips for one second if i drop frames for like three seconds don't you know chirp about it being [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2415.7599999999998s)]
*  f you know that was just for like a second yeah honest history has to acknowledge the part played [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2422.72s)]
*  by all the governments concerned in causing this man-made tragedy the main difference is that the [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2429.36s)]
*  palestinian refugees for the most part were ethnically cleansed by the israeli armed forces [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2433.68s)]
*  with a few exceptions were given by arab governments the option of leaving or staying [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2437.04s)]
*  my book is both a personal record of a complex past and an essay with a political argument [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2441.6s)]
*  it is a critique of zionism from the perspective that is rarely heard outside of israel so like [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2445.84s)]
*  his pivotal work that ethan was misquoting unironically seeks to address the argument [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2450.8s)]
*  that ethan falsely presented in his context nuke which is why i said i will have avish lame on i'm [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2456.1600000000003s)]
*  working on it right now with some of my friends to get him on the broadcast to address this with his [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2461.84s)]
*  own personal words okay there is perhaps no better way but after watching the content nuke i'm [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2468.0s)]
*  suspicious of your intentions which sucks because i've been watching you steady for two weeks but [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2474.2400000000002s)]
*  after your debate with ethan i went to his channel seen that video yeah if you get duped if you get [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2477.52s)]
*  tricked by that then i don't know what to tell you my friend okay yeah here's a here's a couple [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2483.04s)]
*  things that he uh maintained in this here's a couple things that people do usually uh when [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2488.96s)]
*  saying hasan is a bad guy one they'll say he's a socialist but also rich as though this is as as [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2495.92s)]
*  odds with the way i view the world or with anything that i've ever said it's bullshit the second thing [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2502.32s)]
*  that they'll always do is look at him revealing this scary thing we got him and the reality of [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2507.84s)]
*  that is you didn't find this i said it i said it myself this is not a secret if it was a secret [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2515.04s)]
*  you would have encountered this in private conversation in private correspondence you [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2522.2400000000002s)]
*  found a clip where i'm talking to deprogram a podcast that is is conducted by a bunch of [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2527.12s)]
*  people that i like bunch of content creators that i like and in that conversation i'm talking about [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2535.2799999999997s)]
*  something that i've always talked about which is the importance of agitative propaganda this is what [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2541.2s)]
*  i do from a liberal perspective from a liberal perspective i hope people understand that this is [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2547.12s)]
*  akin to the deradicalization initiatives that i partake in in terms of what oh god great man [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2554.32s)]
*  good job good job chatter you're about to get fucking yeeted off the platform so so uh it's [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2562.48s)]
*  here i'll give you a liberalized version of this what do i do in terms of deprogramming or or [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2569.28s)]
*  actively trying to deradicalize right wingers okay right wingers it's the same principle [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2575.44s)]
*  agitative propaganda is exactly that when someone thinks all of their problems revolve around trans [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2584.32s)]
*  people and the existence of trans people and i try to show them that no it's actually a byproduct of [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2590.0s)]
*  the system that we exist under capitalism that's agitative propaganda propaganda does not always [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2595.44s)]
*  mean nefarious i know in america it means nefarious but it actually does not propaganda in and of [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2601.52s)]
*  itself is just telling a story okay this is not something that i shelter this is not something [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2607.6800000000003s)]
*  that i hide even misuses uh my my brutal honesty in that regard in terms of what i'm doing [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2613.52s)]
*  uh to to basically get people to think oh he's like lying to you no i think it's more honest it [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2622.0s)]
*  is the exact same thing that i say when i say when i tell you like i have my biases and i will let [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2629.04s)]
*  you know exactly what they are because everyone has biases and i think it's important to be ahead [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2634.4s)]
*  of time so that people know exactly where you're coming from that's the difference between someone [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2640.48s)]
*  like myself and let's say someone like fox news or even uh msnbc or cnn everyone has biases a big [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2646.08s)]
*  part of what i do is trying to explain to you what the biases of mainstream institutions actually [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2654.88s)]
*  are so you develop a better understanding of where they're coming from what they choose to [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2661.52s)]
*  admit what they choose to focus on in terms of their coverage this is it this is my job [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2666.0s)]
*  anyway the question the question that i have for many if they were to be duped by something like [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2673.76s)]
*  that where it's like asana's nefarious asana's nefariously uh sheltering his full perspective [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2680.16s)]
*  why would i voluntarily reveal that in a podcast that's good issue is that you and your points are [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2687.12s)]
*  dense is hard to handle by a simple minded person brother just shut it down immediately aren't [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2693.36s)]
*  listening all of this still does not justify the genocide israelis are committing against [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2696.4s)]
*  palestinians no history justifies the genocide no i i agree and i think that that is important to [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2699.84s)]
*  also recognize over and over again and that is a major that is a major inconsistency within the [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2705.2000000000003s)]
*  argument that uh within the argument that even was presenting where he recognizes that there is a [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2711.52s)]
*  genocide but also simultaneously but also simultaneously constantly looking for reasons [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2717.52s)]
*  as to why the israeli government behaves the way that it has and historically behaved the way that [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2723.04s)]
*  it has problems lowest common denominator audience response to quick god is and i hate any nuance i [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2728.64s)]
*  mean it doesn't matter i think that there was plenty of quick godges as well it's just like [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2733.68s)]
*  that it's it's one that i was able to achieve plenty of the problem is no one really cares [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2739.12s)]
*  about that either because everyone is invested in the in the conquest of drama everyone is [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2746.24s)]
*  invested in the conquest of like uh their favorite content creator or maybe not even their favorite [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2751.52s)]
*  content creator but a content creator that's going a big like going up against their their [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2756.0s)]
*  content creator that they despise me in this case that's why i saw this phenomenon of neo nazis like [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2761.2799999999997s)]
*  active neo nazi accounts uh openly singing the praises of ethan klein a jewish man right [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2768.3199999999997s)]
*  there were so many out and about neo nazi accounts on twitter that were like this jew destroyed the [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2775.92s)]
*  the islamo turk shit like that and the conversation revolved around him saying that like this [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2782.88s)]
*  the bleach sword was fucking anti-semitic or frogan's thumbnail was anti-semitic like these [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2789.92s)]
*  are not conversations that neo nazis would normally uh entertain at all the reason why [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2794.6400000000003s)]
*  the reason why they were entertaining it was precisely because they like oh this is it this [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2801.2s)]
*  is what i was literally talking about literal actual neo nazis handshaking what you think [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2806.3199999999997s)]
*  i'm like you're coming back from the debate with h3h3 this person's name is hya socca arian [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2812.3199999999997s)]
*  kaguius top gal a straightforward neo nazi right like does does this not ring any alarm bells in [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2818.72s)]
*  ethan's mind as a person who is jewish who has jewish children who is seeing the growth of [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2826.4s)]
*  of anti-semitism on the timeline not realizing that these guys actually are more invested perhaps [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2833.04s)]
*  for some nefarious purpose in undermining me and my position here i wonder what that reason is i [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2838.56s)]
*  wonder why i wonder why so many people who will spam w hitler in chats are on board with what [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2846.2400000000002s)]
*  ethan was saying i don't think that any of these guys are going to recognize this though [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2854.24s)]
*  i think at this point it's because it's so because it's so hyper specific to um ethan's own anger [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2859.04s)]
*  and uh and and for guys like this i don't think this person likes ethan i mean they're a fucking [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2868.08s)]
*  neo nazi right like they probably spot ethan many of the content creators the drama slop tubers have [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2874.0s)]
*  actually shit on ethan quite frequently and generated tens of millions of views off of [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2881.44s)]
*  shitting on ethan sometimes anti-semitically shitting on ethan as well and why are they now [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2886.08s)]
*  on board with ethan is it because my argument is fucking awful and i am uh just completely wrong [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2893.04s)]
*  is it because they disagree is it because they they they also are uh on ethan's side where they [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2899.84s)]
*  also believe that israel's committing a genocide but also all these need all these people need to [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2906.88s)]
*  shut the fuck up about it no it's because this is an opportunity for them to try and actively [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2910.72s)]
*  undermine the position of someone who they see as an ideological opponent and they do not see ethan [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2916.08s)]
*  as an ideological opponent in this regard this would be akin to if i were to go out and align [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2920.64s)]
*  myself with the likes of myron gaines or with the likes of sneko okay that is what this would look [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2928.0s)]
*  like because myron gaines presents himself as being pro-palestine but he's a neo nazi this would [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2935.68s)]
*  be akin to if i align myself with kandace owens and then said look kandace owens even kandace [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2940.48s)]
*  owens has found out that ethan is so fucking that is what this would look like if the role reversal [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2946.8s)]
*  here if if ethan welcoming a lot of these neo nazis a lot of these hateful people that have [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2952.56s)]

*  recognize that they're now welcoming these kinds of reactionary sentiments and that's not ringing [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2964.8s)]
*  any alarm bells for them it would be akin to me unironically aligning myself with aligning myself [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2969.36s)]
*  with fucking myron gaines and sneko and kandace owens right or dame bulls arian these are people [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2977.28s)]
*  with massive audiences but i don't align myself with them i actually spend a good deal of time [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2984.2400000000002s)]
*  actually shitting on their positions as well you see what i mean this is something that i don't [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2989.92s)]
*  think the the drama girlies will actually understand it this is something that i don't [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=2995.76s)]
*  think the drama girlies will understand that is a major issue here can i see the twitter accounts [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3000.1600000000003s)]
*  of people i'm seeing defending ether under my tweets are filled with these gross anti-black [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3004.5600000000004s)]
*  tweets constant slurs praise some of the worst creators on the internet nazi dog whistles makes [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3008.8s)]
*  me comfortable with my own stances only lord can help to this now what only lord can reply to this [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3012.48s)]
*  now ethan's allegiance was some of the worst reactionaries online simply because it's so odd [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3019.28s)]
*  your sexual assault argument was the worst one to me as a survivor but i've heard you talk about [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3025.76s)]
*  it so i know where you're coming from it did sound like you relied on court cases for sexual [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3029.1200000000003s)]
*  assault which is ass but watching your previous vodz i know where you stand no i'm gonna i'm [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3032.1600000000003s)]
*  gonna get to that in a second as well because if you noticed he did something very nefarious there [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3035.5200000000004s)]
*  he basically he he i'll get to that hold on but the short and sweet of it on that one was the the [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3040.4s)]
*  shocking display of disingenuousness from ethan on that part where he said that i was denying [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3049.84s)]
*  he said that i was denying the the atrocity propaganda that israel is committed when saying [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3057.1200000000003s)]
*  that hamas directed systematic rape took place mass rapes took place on october 7 this is this [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3062.8s)]
*  is atrocity propaganda that is not new this has happened throughout all kinds of of settler [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3069.6000000000004s)]
*  colonial conquest this is what they this is what the american settler said about the indigenous [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3076.64s)]
*  population right this is what they this is what uh the the clan said about black people this is [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3081.52s)]
*  always like you have to dehumanize your opponent in order to justify to the rest of the people [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3088.0s)]
*  that like the violence that you are going to subject them to is totally permissible they're [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3093.52s)]
*  savages they're barbaric rapist savages it is a trope for a particular reason it is unironically [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3099.2s)]
*  the weaponization of sexual assault the reason why i also found it particularly gross was because [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3105.04s)]
*  he demonstrated that he didn't even care or he didn't even care about what anyone was saying [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3112.0s)]
*  in that rug simply was just like oh you're going to speak over this victim you're going to speak [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3116.0s)]
*  over this victim when in fact the video that he showed of me prior to the victim speaking out [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3119.68s)]
*  was literally me recognizing said victim there's never been a moment where i've said that there [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3125.68s)]
*  was no rapes that took place that especially after october 7 i've always maintained the position [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3132.0s)]
*  that there is a likelihood that sexual assaults might have happened on october 7 but the problem [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3137.92s)]
*  here is that israel has actually destroyed the evidence and made it impossible and his counter [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3142.88s)]
*  to that was oh out of the dignity for the victims there was no time for forensic examination [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3147.92s)]
*  and that's ridiculous because you want justice to be served for the victims that's what i was [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3152.96s)]
*  saying i wasn't saying like it's not rape unless it's like prosecutable in court picture it didn't [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3157.7599999999998s)]
*  happen and that's what a lot of people are saying in terms of my conversation around [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3162.56s)]
*  circumstantial evidence the circumstantial evidence in this regard is not the same kind [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3167.52s)]
*  of circumstantial evidence you see in criminal litigation in an american court this is a [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3172.3999999999996s)]
*  preliminary investigation that is supposed to open up the door to a full-blown investigation by the [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3178.08s)]
*  united nations that investigation has been blocked of israel that is that is what i was [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3185.12s)]
*  maintaining here and the reason why it's important to note that is because a lot of the circumstantial [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3190.72s)]
*  evidence that they've actually brought forward in the un report by israel's own admission has now [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3196.4s)]
*  been undermined through forensic examination i'll give you an example it's like when you when you [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3201.6s)]
*  when you saw these gruesome images when you saw gruesome images from october 7 [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3209.6800000000003s)]
*  and people pointed to them to say like no this person is being raped this person has been raped [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3216.32s)]
*  and then those people the the ones that weren't actually killed in the process came out and said [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3221.1200000000003s)]
*  that that did not happen to them this directly undermines and showcases the importance of going [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3227.44s)]
*  beyond friends going beyond circumstantial evidence in terms of like analysis of footage [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3233.84s)]
*  okay especially when considering that this is there was plenty of atrocities that took [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3240.88s)]
*  place on october 7 i've never discounted that it is one of the most horrifying live streamed [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3246.2400000000002s)]
*  massacres before what israel did of course which is infinitely more horrifying than october 7 [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3253.36s)]
*  considering what israel's been doing is a is a systematic full-blown execution of all palestinians [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3258.24s)]
*  and their lives in the gaza strip with significantly more sophisticated machinery but but having said [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3265.6s)]
*  that considering that considering that this was almost entirely live streamed there was a lot of [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3273.04s)]
*  evidence that instantly undermined second-hand accounts that took place on that day [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3281.04s)]
*  okay but like i said it as far as ethan utilizing this like like weaponizing sexual assault it was so [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3288.56s)]
*  insane to me that he he went to that length especially considering especially considering [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3298.56s)]
*  that i'm of course going to be amenable to hearing his position on this if there's something that i'm [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3304.3199999999997s)]
*  oblivious to in terms of all of the reading that i have done on the the mass systematized mass [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3309.8399999999997s)]
*  rape conducted by hamas on october 7 but the worst part of this was he actually [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3317.6s)]
*  showcased the claims made by someone who i also have recognized who i who i've never actually [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3323.8399999999997s)]
*  undermined the testimony of amit shoshana i believe is her name and the victim that he pointed to was [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3330.4s)]
*  one that i had actually talked about in the video that he showed in the video that he showed prior [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3337.52s)]
*  to that and then he claimed that she actually had been sexually assaulted on october 7 it was [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3343.12s)]
*  one of the victims from october 7 this is an important distinction to make and he he basically [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3347.6s)]
*  tried to to present this as like he he tried to present this as like me denying rapes when in fact [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3354.08s)]
*  i was talking about a totally different subject when people say believe all women [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3361.52s)]
*  um that is understand that's that's the whole point of me too is to not [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3367.68s)]
*  re reflexively disbelieve women because that's precisely what people do there's never been a [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3373.2799999999997s)]
*  moment where i've reflexively disbelieved a victim that came out my question to ethan was who are [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3377.68s)]
*  these victims what are their names that have come out because you might know something that i do not [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3383.6s)]
*  know from all of the things that i have read on this matter and yet he actually didn't if you [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3388.4s)]
*  noticed he actually didn't bring forward any names with that with with the exception of [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3394.08s)]
*  the first-hand account testimony of someone who i had also recognized [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3398.4s)]
*  and the secondary position that i have maintained always which ethan at a certain point also [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3410.16s)]
*  recognized that he went back on is the fact that even if there is an endless amount of even if [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3416.32s)]
*  there's an endless amount of evidence and it's like verifiable there have been mass rapes that [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3425.1200000000003s)]
*  took place israel's reaction is still unjustifiable you cannot do a genocide you cannot do a genocide [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3430.48s)]
*  on an entire population that you are the belligerent occupier of because uh militancy in that process [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3437.84s)]
*  conducted sexual assaults that is completely unacceptable nothing will nothing will make [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3445.28s)]
*  genocide acceptable that is my position that has always been my position if you don't mind i have [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3451.36s)]
*  a clarifying question about an article ethan read during the rape combo yeah he highly manipulated [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3456.88s)]
*  that segment because as supporters of yours i was left confused hope you don't get undeserving [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3460.8s)]
*  fallout no it's fine i definitely will get fallout from that are you kidding me that was the entire [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3464.0800000000004s)]
*  purpose of that conversation it was designed to it was designed to invoke a response that [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3468.48s)]
*  can be manipulated in the aftermath that is the real reason that's why they went on a full court [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3474.9599999999996s)]
*  press on live stream fails and all these other subreddits that they actually brigade uh to to [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3479.7599999999998s)]
*  say see this is what happened but i i think i still conducted myself as best as i could in that [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3485.4399999999996s)]
*  process and i made sure that every single part of that conversation i still kept saying you are i [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3492.16s)]
*  mean he admitted he admitted to lying dude you were underprepared and naive that's not true [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3498.48s)]
*  he admitted to literally lying here this is the this is one of the examples right here there's [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3503.84s)]
*  women that come out and say i was raped what there are women on the record on video saying i was raped [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3510.88s)]
*  like you're saying wait you're saying there are multiple women that are on the record saying i was [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3518.4s)]
*  raped correct and i asked him who these women were there's only example that he heard [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3523.84s)]
*  about shoshana which was also a person that i had acknowledged by his own admission [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3530.4s)]
*  which he openly admitted to lying about the fact that the fact that this escapes people's [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3537.44s)]
*  consciousness is shocking to me because the aftermath in the aftermath of that segment [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3543.6800000000003s)]
*  aftermath of that segment he openly recognized that he had lied and he had actually smeared me [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3549.2s)]
*  as someone who did not recognize that sexual assault had taken place at any so if you think [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3554.4s)]
*  that that if you think that that in and of itself was like a massive gotcha you're falling for the [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3559.12s)]
*  attempts here but i totally understand why it would be confusing in the process you almost [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3566.0s)]
*  didn't use any clips to prove he's a liar which is important proof so people can actually listen [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3570.56s)]
*  to what you have to say but you can't you can make it up when you respond to a shitty video well [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3573.6s)]
*  there's not anything i can do in terms of clips because you know he controls the clips and the [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3577.36s)]
*  part about this that i find unconscionable is the fact that he also turned around and and and made [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3582.8s)]
*  it seem as though the testimony that she delivered was one that i was actually diminishing when it [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3590.08s)]
*  was one that i actually had recognized but then he turned around and used her as an example for [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3595.04s)]
*  october 7 a point that he was trying to make which was that mass rapes had taken place on october 7 [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3599.84s)]
*  and there were victims that had come out there have not been from what i have seen and again [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3606.4s)]
*  i i will go back to this once again and i'm planning on doing a of when he kept saying don't [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3613.04s)]
*  speak over the victim but he didn't give a fuck you were talking about the right to rape protest [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3618.96s)]
*  was actually discussing yeah exactly that uh i i plan on going over this uh going over that part [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3622.32s)]
*  especially in the conversation because i think it's it's important if you recall i think something [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3628.88s)]
*  very nefarious took place in the aftermath of october 7 as you guys know obviously there were [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3635.28s)]
*  plenty of atrocities that israel could point to but they needed more which is precisely the reason [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3640.6400000000003s)]
*  why they engaged in atrocity propaganda right 40 beheaded babies babies lit on fire with kerosene [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3645.1200000000003s)]
*  um and and all of this stuff that took place out of all of the the heightened atrocity propaganda [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3652.5600000000004s)]
*  that israel had elevated okay there was many of them were immediately discounted right many of [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3659.2s)]
*  them were immediately discounted by israeli media as a matter of fact and the reason for why they [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3666.08s)]
*  did that was because these are real victims these are real victims that were slaughtered right so [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3670.56s)]
*  obviously if you're israeli media you have to you have to give them the dignity you have to give [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3677.3599999999997s)]
*  their family members the dignity of understanding what took place and that's precisely why a lot of [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3682.16s)]
*  that was discounted the only one that actually was left uh without without any sort of counter [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3687.12s)]
*  position was hamas backed systematized rapes that took place on october 7 and i believe the reason [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3693.52s)]
*  why a lot of people were were uh wary of immediately countering that position is because [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3700.96s)]
*  of course like there there's a high likelihood of rapes taking place not systematized but rapes [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3707.92s)]
*  taking place on on uh conflicts this is my position as well this is what i said as well over [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3714.8s)]
*  and over again ironically enough and many of the clips that he was actually clipping out of context [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3720.1600000000003s)]
*  i was debating other chatters saying there is still a likelihood that that sexual violence took [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3724.0s)]
*  place on october 7 because that is a commonplace event in all conflict okay having said that israel [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3729.1200000000003s)]
*  refused any sort of real investigation take place and the investigations that came a year after the [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3738.0800000000004s)]
*  fact showed or disproved a lot of the initial narratives that they ran with and that is the [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3743.04s)]
*  issue okay and the real reason why that happened the real reason why that happened was because [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3749.2s)]
*  the real reason why that happened was specifically because uh they wanted to do atrocity propaganda [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3754.88s)]
*  to justify the genocide why did you not bring up a song saying palestinian women don't face [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3761.7599999999998s)]
*  sexual violence wait i did i did bring that up anyway and for the record like the reason why i [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3766.8s)]
*  brought up the the 40 beheaded babies and flame babies in their crib stuff is because ethan and [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3773.6s)]
*  far far far after it was already bit it was officially uh it was officially recognized as [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3778.56s)]
*  as propaganda that did not take place they went on a mission to kill it was literally can no [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3786.64s)]
*  matter who it is slaughter as many people as they could until they were stopped the [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3791.28s)]
*  basically to kill civilians yeah there's a you can see their war plans they went specifically to [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3796.1600000000003s)]
*  kabat-seam to kill the inhabitants there those are not military compound they flamed cribs with [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3801.36s)]
*  babies in them yeah on fire so like come on what are we talking about they went on a mission yeah [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3806.5600000000004s)]
*  like lit babies on fire and stuff like that's not real this just like why why is that still [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3810.96s)]
*  happening you know what i mean why why are people still saying that this is supposed to be a [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3815.92s)]
*  an anti-genocide broadcast like do you see what i mean this doesn't make sense with the the [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3820.08s)]
*  attitude that ethan demonstrated yesterday or at least like some of the things that he said yesterday [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3826.56s)]
*  first hand more first-hand in comments there's even a person that survived the nova disaster [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3830.72s)]
*  they managed to survive it and then i think maybe a year later or a few months later they ended up [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3837.84s)]
*  committed suicide because they couldn't bear to live having seen what you know what they saw [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3845.2s)]
*  on that day more than one person that committed suicide it might be more that for some reason i [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3852.08s)]
*  don't know the exact number i know there's for sure one that i know for sure but there might be [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3856.3199999999997s)]
*  more and i mean the kind of stuff that they saw was like rape gang rape mutilation um yeah so [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3861.68s)]
*  they had to witness that and could not bear yeah so this is this is like they weren't first [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3870.72s)]
*  they uh this is uh heila klein claiming that a nova festival survivors are raping gang rape [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3876.72s)]
*  killed themselves because they couldn't deal with the trauma she cites as a part of her regurgitation [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3882.24s)]
*  of the genocidal atrocity propaganda saying there's so much evidence for she's referring [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3885.2s)]
*  to a suicide letter that was posted online claiming this over six months ago which has [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3888.8799999999997s)]
*  been debunked as a hoax by israeli reporters a day after it came out even hen mazic and other [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3892.3199999999997s)]
*  zinus propagandists who shared this initial report were forced to retract it six months [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3898.24s)]
*  after the fact that this suicide letter was was revealed to be a hoax and was retracted by israeli [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3904.7999999999997s)]
*  media heila is still using it as a as a point in her commentary to to justify to justify all the [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3912.72s)]
*  things that unfolded this is what i mean here it is this is adam schaffer a story that ran in recent [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3922.88s)]
*  days about a nova survivor who saw horrors and committed suicide did not leave a single dry eye [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3930.88s)]
*  after trying to retract or after trying to reach the family tell the story the search turned into [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3934.6400000000003s)]
*  an investigation we will reveal tonight in the tube that it is a complete fake it is not clear [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3938.0s)]
*  what brings people to invent like this but the cheap in the real plight of survivors and the play [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3943.12s)]
*  with the souls of others is simply disgusting do you understand like this is a real weaponization [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3946.72s)]
*  of sexual trauma this is a real weaponization of of a fabricated story there are plenty of people [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3953.3599999999997s)]
*  who then also apologize there are plenty of people who literally apologized and retracted their story [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3961.4399999999996s)]
*  with the suicide letter but six months after the fact she was still saying it she was still repeating [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3966.3999999999996s)]
*  okay remember even just yesterday a lot of the pro-israeli outlets what did they do here in the [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3971.76s)]
*  united states of america what did they do they claimed that mohsen mahdawi was actually a [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3977.76s)]
*  terrorist mohsen mahdawi the student activist who is a pacifist that was recently released [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=3984.0800000000004s)]

*  these other propaganda rags put out about him they literally clipped nefariously a court case an [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4004.08s)]
*  accusation in a in a court case about him going up to random people and saying how much he wanted [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4010.9599999999996s)]
*  to kill jews with an automatic rifle there was an fbi investigation that was conducted into it [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4016.9599999999996s)]
*  and the investigation actually revealed that this was unsubstantiated it was ridiculous [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4022.72s)]
*  fucking made-up bullshit and yet they clip the part that the fbi investigation undermines that [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4026.48s)]
*  point and yet they ran with that regardless it's just lying that's all this is so for the record [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4032.32s)]
*  with omit sosana with omit sosana and her testimony this is where i disagree with ze squirrel [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4039.92s)]
*  because it falls in the weeds here because their perspective on this is that she never said it was [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4047.04s)]
*  rape she said it was sexual assault i don't care i don't care that i don't care to make a [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4054.32s)]
*  distinction between the two okay you can you can get mad at me if you want but i do think that it's [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4059.92s)]
*  valid to to take her testimony as it is even if he even if she has changed it throughout this time [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4064.96s)]
*  okay even if it's not a distinction that is important to me in this process and it's also [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4071.52s)]
*  something that i've actually recognized over and over and over and over again now the the [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4077.6s)]
*  the other side of this was the zaka people that was used in the sherryl sanberg documentary [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4086.88s)]
*  the zaka people that were used in the sherryl sanberg documentary were known to be fabulous [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4094.96s)]
*  they were known they were outed by israeli media once again to have lied okay look carefully [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4100.48s)]
*  oh sanberg withdraws back from horror yeah so that's the other side of this and he i believe [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4107.599999999999s)]
*  ethan used a one of the i believe ethan used one of the parts of the sherryl sanberg documentary [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4112.879999999999s)]
*  they didn't just lie they posed bodies i know they lied they posed bodies they actually disrupted [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4120.48s)]
*  any sort of investigation from taking place this was a major major crisis in israel at the time [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4125.36s)]
*  immediately after october 7 i've seen you make arguments against victims being used as process [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4132.4s)]
*  without getting caught up it wasn't just ethan to derail you but you were vague in your response [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4136.639999999999s)]
*  i have to assume the attention was being in a larger audience and allow for some drama to keep [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4139.28s)]
*  less regular views entertained and learn something for the sake of palestinians but you got too caught [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4144.0s)]
*  up in the drama to make points i know you're capable of making no that i participated in if [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4146.719999999999s)]
*  you think that i uh it was simply because i wanted to fucking uh move on and do drama are you serious [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4152.32s)]
*  anyway the the very fact that they keep saying that like i'm discounting uh the testimonies [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4158.88s)]
*  that exist is crazy because there aren't there are second-hand accounts that have been discounted at [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4165.599999999999s)]
*  this point or are proven to be not true by israeli authorities i can't work with i can't work with [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4171.36s)]
*  not even a third-hand account but whatever ethan is claiming is going on do you see what i mean [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4179.280000000001s)]
*  but i'm still of course the like there is obviously there is for the record for the record [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4184.64s)]
*  there is there's i'm never going to automatically discount new information if new information has [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4191.84s)]
*  come out that i was oblivious to that i was unfamiliar with in terms of uh the the uh [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4197.92s)]
*  numerous victims coming out through forensic examination in the aftermath for example as [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4205.12s)]
*  opposed to what has happened which is the opposite uh because the bodies were moved over to a military [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4209.44s)]
*  facility and the military facility did conduct some forensic examinations that actually discounted [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4214.799999999999s)]
*  some of the uh the genital mutilation narratives that people were presenting because the most [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4220.719999999999s)]
*  extreme version of this is what rabbi shmueli was saying if you recall where he was like [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4225.2s)]
*  palestinians ripped the boobs off of israeli women and played soccer with them and shit like that [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4229.04s)]
*  a lot of that gets lost in the lost in the conversation because it's so incredible of [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4234.96s)]
*  a claim to make without any evidence whatsoever that the claimant of himself obviously discounts [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4239.36s)]
*  the veracity of it christen eric times is doing this again israeli hostage says she was sexually [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4244.4800000000005s)]

*  lack of evidence for systematized assault and most importantly talk about why you are disputing these [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4264.4s)]
*  claims uh in the first place that they are used to support genocide i feel like we can't definitively [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4268.16s)]
*  say what the scale of sexual violence was or wasn't on 10-7 so we can't seem counterproductive [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4272.08s)]
*  to weed on individual cases disproving one or the other don't roll over but also don't get two in [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uWXRYNgCA&t=4276.32s)]
