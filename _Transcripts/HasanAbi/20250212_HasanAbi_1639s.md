# Trump Reveals Ukraine's Future In Press Conference Response | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o)
*  I said that this war will only end because Ukraine has no longer like enough manpower. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=0.0s)]
*  The war will end on the conditions of the battlefield. If it was slated to end, it is [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=5.84s)]
*  slated to end, whether it's Trump doing it or Biden doing it. Okay. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  What are you going to have to do what he has to do? Also look at the. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=14.72s)]
*  Anyway, Trump is live taking questions. Let's take a look. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=22.84s)]
*  Vladimir Putin. And were there any preconditions set to agree to this meeting? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=25.44s)]
*  No, we had a great call and it lasted for a long time, over an hour this morning. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=30.16s)]
*  I also had with President Zelensky a very good call after that. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=38.32s)]
*  And I think we're on the way to getting peace. I think President Putin wants peace. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=42.84s)]
*  And President Zelensky wants peace. And I want peace. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=48.8s)]
*  I just want to see people stop getting killed. We're very far away from that particular war, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=52.92s)]
*  but that's a vicious war. Probably a million and a half soldiers killed in a short period of time. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=58.28s)]
*  I've never seen anything. I have pictures that are. You wouldn't believe it. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=63.720000000000006s)]
*  You wouldn't believe what you have to look at. Young, beautiful soldiers that are just being [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=67.48s)]
*  decimated. And it would be nice to end it immediately. But we had a very good talk with [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=72.52000000000001s)]
*  people who didn't really know what President Putin's thoughts were. But I think I can say [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=79.88s)]
*  with great confidence he wants to see it ended also. That's good. And we're going to work toward [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=86.28s)]
*  getting it ended and as fast as possible. It's a horrible situation going over. It's flat land. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=91.8s)]
*  And the bullet goes off and the only thing it can hit is a body, a human body, a young human body. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=100.2s)]
*  And they're losing just tremendous numbers of mostly soldiers. The cities and [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=106.2s)]
*  he loves that line largely demolished. He thinks it's poetic. It's a shame. What's happened to that [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=112.2s)]
*  country would have never happened if I were president that I can tell you it's to look at [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=117.0s)]
*  that. And October 7th would have never happened either by the way, the Middle East. But we'll get [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=121.88000000000001s)]
*  it. I think we'll get it. We'll get something done. We're going to be meeting actually tomorrow. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=128.6s)]
*  They're meeting in Munich, as you know, and we're going to have some other meetings and we'll be [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=134.28s)]
*  I'll be dealing with President Putin largely on the phone. And we ultimately expect to meet. In [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=138.2s)]
*  fact, we expect that he'll come here and I'll go there. And we're going to meet also probably in [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=144.35999999999999s)]
*  Saudi Arabia. The first time we'll meet in Saudi Arabia, see if we get something done. But we want [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=150.44s)]
*  to end that war. That war is a disaster. It's a really bloody, horrible war. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=155.95999999999998s)]
*  I think so. We think we're going to probably meet in Saudi Arabia. The first meeting [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=160.44s)]
*  hasn't been set, but not too distant future. We both understand, you know, we know the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=168.76s)]
*  crown prince and I think it'd be a very good place to meet. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=174.84s)]
*  So it sounds like that would just be a meeting between you and Putin and perhaps the crown prince, but not President Zelensky. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=179.96s)]
*  Probably we'll have a first meeting and then we'll see what we can do about the second meeting. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=186.36s)]
*  Did you also commit to go to Ukraine? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=191.4s)]
*  What about Ukraine? Did you commit to go to Ukraine? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=194.84s)]
*  No, I haven't. I haven't committed to go to Ukraine. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=197.72000000000003s)]
*  I would think about going. Yeah, I think about it. No problem. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=203.16000000000003s)]
*  But let me say to you, Mr. President, that they received your vision. What is your plan to end this war? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=206.04s)]
*  Like today's Secretary of State said. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=211.79999999999998s)]
*  Well, I'm not going to tell you my plan. I can just tell you we've made a lot of progress. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=213.79999999999998s)]
*  You won't tell me his plan. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=216.6s)]
*  By Biden, not by me, because this has been going on for now a long time, years. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=218.6s)]
*  And it should have been done by Biden. Just like the young gentleman that I brought home yesterday, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=223.16s)]
*  after two weeks, we worked on it for two weeks. He was a fine man and he was in there for three and a half, almost four years. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=230.04s)]
*  And they weren't able to do a thing. And I got him out. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=239.88s)]
*  And as you know, I didn't pay six billion dollars. I didn't pay anything. We did a trade. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=243.88s)]
*  And we did a good job. We got him out in two weeks. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=250.35999999999999s)]
*  Should have been out years ago. Really should have been out years ago. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=254.76s)]
*  What about the proposed NATO membership for Ukraine? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=258.59999999999997s)]
*  I don't think it's practical to have it personally. I know that a new Secretary of Defense, who's excellent, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=261.55999999999995s)]
*  Pete made a statement today saying that he thinks it's unlikely or impractical. I think probably that's true. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=270.2s)]
*  I think long before President Putin, they said there's no way they'd allow that. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=276.67999999999995s)]
*  This has been going on for many, many years. They've been saying that for a long time, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=281.23999999999995s)]
*  that Ukraine cannot go into NATO. And I'm okay with that. I just want the war, whether they are or they're not. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=286.12s)]
*  But it certainly would seem to be that most people have said that that is something that's not going to happen. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=293.8s)]
*  Quiet part out loud. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=297.24s)]
*  Are you freezing out President Zelensky of this process a bit? Isn't there a danger to that? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=299.24s)]
*  There's no subtitles. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=302.76s)]
*  No, I don't think so, as long as he's there. But at some point, you're going to have to have elections too. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=303.8s)]
*  You're going to have to have an election. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=308.52000000000004s)]
*  But I think, KK, when you appear in the assurance business, Mr. President, what does that look like? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=309.72s)]
*  In terms of what? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=314.04s)]
*  If the war were to end, he says he wants guarantees of security. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=315.64s)]
*  We'll see what that means. I think when the war ends, one thing he was very strong about, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=320.2s)]
*  if it ends, he wants it to end. And as President Putin said that, he wants it to end. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=325.48s)]
*  He doesn't want to end it and then go back to fighting six months later. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=331.24s)]
*  We talked about the possibility, I mentioned it, of a ceasefire so we can stop the killing. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=335.4s)]
*  And I think we'll probably end up at some point getting a ceasefire in the not too distant future. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=339.64s)]
*  You said Trump isn't going to end this war. What's your analysis here? What's changed? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=353.96s)]
*  I think I said that this war will only end because Ukraine has no longer [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=357.15999999999997s)]
*  enough manpower. The war will end on the conditions of the battlefield. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=362.36s)]
*  If it was slated to end, it is slated to end, whether it's Trump doing it or Biden doing it. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=367.08s)]
*  Also look at the fucking God. We don't know particularly great, but it mildly, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=374.6s)]
*  it's got a country where, you know, it's been savaged and attacked and go back to [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=378.84s)]
*  10 seconds. What made a lot of profits off. And the only thing it can hit is a body, a human body, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=385.96s)]
*  a young human body. Wow. How different. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=390.68s)]
*  Tremendous numbers of mostly soldiers. How different. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=394.2s)]
*  What about Ukraine? It should have been done by Biden, not by me, because this has been going on [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=401.72s)]
*  for now a long time, years. And it should have been done by Biden. Just like the young gentleman [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=407.8s)]
*  that I brought home yesterday after two weeks. We worked on it for two weeks. It was a [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=415.16s)]
*  fine man and he was in there for three and a half, almost four years. And they weren't able to do a [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=422.12s)]
*  thing. And I got him out. And as you know, I didn't pay $6 billion. I didn't pay anything. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=429.48s)]
*  We did a trade and we did a good job. We got him out in two weeks. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=435.56s)]
*  It should have been out years ago. It really should have been out years ago. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=441.08s)]
*  I know Secretary of Defense who's ex-electable, I think probably that's true. I think long before [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=449.08s)]
*  President Putin, they said there's no way they'd allow that. This has been going on for many, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=454.84s)]
*  many years. They've been saying that for a long time, that Ukraine cannot go into NATO. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=460.36s)]
*  And I'm okay with it. I just want the word whether they are or they're not. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=466.52s)]
*  But it certainly would seem to be that most people have said that that is something that's [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=473.15999999999997s)]
*  not going to happen. No, I don't think so. As long as he's there. But you know, at some point, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=477.15999999999997s)]
*  you're going to have to have elections too. You're going to have to have an election. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=486.28s)]
*  He says he wants to secure any assurances, Mr. President. What does that look like? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=488.84s)]
*  In terms of what? If the war were to end, he says he wants guarantees of security. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=493.08s)]
*  We'll see what that means. We have, I think when the war ends, one thing he was very strong about, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=499.08s)]
*  he wants, if it ends, he wants it to end. And that's President Putin said that. He wants it to end. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=504.2s)]
*  He doesn't want to end it and then go back to fighting six months later. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=509.79999999999995s)]
*  We talked about the possibility, I mentioned it, of a ceasefire so we can stop the killing. And I [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=513.8s)]
*  think we'll probably end up at some point getting a ceasefire in the not too distant future. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=518.2s)]
*  Will Ukraine be an equal member of this peace process? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=522.5200000000001s)]
*  Say it. What? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=525.88s)]
*  Do you view Ukraine as an equal member of this peace process? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=526.5200000000001s)]
*  It's an interesting question. I think they have to make peace. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=532.5200000000001s)]
*  Their people are being killed and I think they have to make peace. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=537.0s)]
*  I said that was not a good war to go into and I think they have to make peace. That's what I think. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=541.48s)]
*  Why did you decide to abide to Ukraine? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=547.08s)]
*  Would you support Zelensky's ceding territory or exchanging territory in any agreement as a war? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=549.72s)]
*  Well, he's going to have to do what he has to do, but his poll numbers aren't particularly great, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=555.24s)]
*  to put it mildly. He's got a country where it's been savaged and attacked and he's got an army [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=562.6s)]
*  that's been very, very brave actually, despite the fact that we've given him, in my opinion, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=568.76s)]
*  $350 billion. That's what the real number is. You don't hear that number. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=572.84s)]
*  Europe is given, in my opinion, $100 billion and they've done it in the form of a loan. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=575.88s)]
*  I have a Secretary of Treasury right now who's actually quite brave. He's over in Ukraine [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=579.88s)]
*  on a train and there's a lot of things happening around that train that aren't so good. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=583.08s)]
*  He's going there to get a document done where we're going to be [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=586.9200000000001s)]
*  assured that we're going to, in some form, get this money back because we're putting up [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=590.76s)]
*  far more money than Europe and Europe is in far more danger than we are. We have an ocean in [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=594.12s)]
*  between. Europe has nothing in between. You know what they have in between? They have Ukraine in [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=597.24s)]
*  between. So, as you know, Europe is putting up money. They're getting it in the form of a loan [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=600.84s)]
*  and the United States, under Biden, didn't do loans. They just handed money every time somebody [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=606.0400000000001s)]
*  walked in from Ukraine. They just handed them money, foolishly. This should have never happened. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=609.32s)]
*  It should have never started and once it did, other things should have happened. Other things [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=613.08s)]
*  should have taken place. So, we're getting security on our money. We're going to have it [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=615.96s)]
*  secured by... They have raw earth and they have oil and gas and they have a lot of other things [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=622.12s)]
*  and we're asking for security in our money. They've agreed to it. Ukraine has agreed to it. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=625.88s)]
*  We are, but we want it secured and the money is going to be secured. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=632.6800000000001s)]
*  When will the U.S. stop spending money? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=635.72s)]
*  Because if we didn't do that, then Putin would say he won. We're the thing that's holding it back [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=637.72s)]
*  and frankly we'll go as long as we have to go because we're not going to let the other happen. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=641.48s)]
*  But President Putin wants to have peace now and that's good and he didn't want to have peace with [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=644.76s)]
*  Biden. You tell me why. That is okay. Was that conversation with Putin to start these negotiations [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=648.44s)]
*  part of the deal to bring Fogel home? No, but it was a nice thing that he allowed [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=653.32s)]
*  Mark Fogel to leave. In fact, Mark wasn't feeling well, but he was all of a sudden about two weeks [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=657.64s)]
*  ago he started being treated very nicely. He said they took him out for haircuts. They took him out. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=663.56s)]
*  They helped him out a little bit and made him feel better, made him feel nice to him. He said, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=667.3199999999999s)]
*  I saw something happening and it coincided with when I came into office. So that was nice and he [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=672.1199999999999s)]
*  was a fine person. He was so happy to be out. He was there for three and a half years plus [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=677.9599999999999s)]
*  and he shouldn't have been there at all. They should have had him out much faster than that. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=682.4399999999999s)]
*  What is the future in which Ukraine returns with pre-2014 borders? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=685.8s)]
*  Well, I think Pete said today that that's unlikely. It certainly would seem to be unlikely. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=691.88s)]
*  They took a lot of land and they fought for that land and they lost a lot of soldiers. But it would [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=695.64s)]
*  just seem to be and I'm not making an opinion on it, but I've read a lot on it and a lot of people [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=700.76s)]
*  think that that's unlikely. Some of it will come back. I think some of it will come back. Yeah, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=704.04s)]
*  some of that land will come back. Who are you with? Me. Yeah. Yeah, who? AFP, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=707.0799999999999s)]
*  Agence France-Presse. Okay. I just wanted to ask you, the things that the secretary of defense was [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=712.92s)]
*  talking about, the 2014 borders and the lack of NATO membership. Ultimately, these are both demands [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=718.28s)]
*  that Russia has made in the past. Is there not a danger of having Russia kind of win on this? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=723.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, I think that if you look at the war, the way the war is going, you'll have to make your [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=727.16s)]
*  own determination. I'm just here to try and get peace. I don't care so much about anything other [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=730.92s)]
*  than I want to stop having millions of people killed. Killed. Last night, you know, Kiev got [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=734.84s)]
*  hit very, very hard. I want to see people stop getting killed. That war is ridiculous. It should [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=739.08s)]
*  have never happened and it would have never happened. Yeah, a couple of more questions. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=742.6800000000001s)]
*  Are you planning to sign a second border of reciprocal tariffs, sir? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=745.32s)]
*  Yes, I am. In fact, I may do it today and if I do it today, I could almost do it right now. Would [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=749.08s)]
*  you like me to talk about that? I don't want to take anything away from this young lady's day [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=752.5200000000001s)]
*  because this is her day and I may do it later on or I may do it tomorrow morning, but we'll be [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=755.48s)]
*  signing reciprocal tariffs. The world has taken advantage of the United States for many years. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=758.84s)]
*  They've charged us massive tariffs that we haven't charged them. And as you know, I just did something [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=762.76s)]
*  on steel and aluminum, 25%. That'll go up at some point, but 25%. People that are confused about [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=766.68s)]
*  like extracting resources from Ukraine, we're doing IMF shit to our own nation right now. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=771.7199999999999s)]
*  It was even weaker on steel. Steel was just absolutely, it really started with Obama. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=777.16s)]
*  These guys will literally steal from America. They don't even have a sense of national identity. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=780.68s)]
*  And what they did was, he was so worried about... Like they're not even real nationalists. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=786.12s)]
*  Okay. With respect to countries taking advantage, you should have looked at the countries, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=789.7199999999999s)]
*  both friend and foe, taking advantage of themselves. Why the fuck would they care about [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=792.84s)]
*  Ukrainians and their natural resources? What are you talking about? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=796.0400000000001s)]
*  We're going to be... I'm considering, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=799.0s)]
*  you should talk about widespread fraud and abuse. Oh yeah. Tremendous fraud. There's tremendous fraud. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=800.6800000000001s)]
*  And it's hard to believe that you can have that kind of fraud. You're talking about like, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=804.84s)]
*  are you talking about what? Wait, wait, wait. Which are you talking about? You're talking about with [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=808.76s)]
*  regard to all of the investigations that are going on about this stupidity. What we're going [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=811.96s)]
*  to do is tomorrow, I'm having a news conference. I'm going to read to you some of the names that [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=815.24s)]
*  hundreds of millions and even billions of dollars have been given to. And if you tell me that we [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=818.6800000000001s)]
*  should be giving money to those things, those entities, I think you'll probably have to leave [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=822.28s)]
*  as a reporter because you're not very talented. When you look at the kind of money, billions and [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=825.9599999999999s)]
*  billions of dollars being thrown away illegally, and there's no chance... I mean, I say in front of [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=829.24s)]
*  our attorney general, there's no chance that there's not kickbacks or something going on. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=834.04s)]
*  When you give millions and millions of dollars to somebody that stands to look at something [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=837.3199999999999s)]
*  for 15 minutes and walks away with millions of dollars, that money's coming back in some form. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=840.92s)]
*  And that's only one form of corruption. The biggest thing is what they do to our country. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=845.0799999999999s)]
*  They're taking massive amounts of money and spending it on items. I went through a list of [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=848.76s)]
*  200 expenditures that were made and I found three that looked like they were reasonable. Okay, three. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=852.6s)]
*  And we'll be talking about that tomorrow. We have a lot of stuff. And I want to commend Elon because [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=857.8s)]
*  he's done a fantastic... He doesn't need this. He's abused by you people every day. He's found [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=861.3199999999999s)]
*  more things than anybody could find. I think he's got the credibility to do it. I know he does. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=864.92s)]
*  And it's his group of people. They started off with 12. I call them 12 geniuses. They started [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=868.36s)]
*  off with 12 and they went to 20 and 25 and now they're up to almost 100 people. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=873.56s)]
*  Thank you, Bill Morigar, for the Tank Community to get this up. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=876.36s)]
*  This is a massive thought that's taking place. And then you have judges that are activists and [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=879.4s)]
*  they sit there and they say, oh, as an example, $59 million going to a little small group in New [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=881.72s)]
*  York City. You get nothing going to North Carolina to help them. Nothing. They say, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=886.84s)]
*  we don't have any money because they've given it away on the border, but you have nothing. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=890.04s)]
*  What they did to North Carolina is a shame. And then they sent $59 million to New York City for [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=893.24s)]
*  a hotel for a little bit of nothing. What they've done, a hotel that was not luxury, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=896.84s)]
*  that's getting luxury rates for migrants where they're making a fortune and we catch them. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=901.64s)]
*  We catch them. And but a judge says, well, even though it may be a fraud, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=906.28s)]
*  you have to send the money in anyway. Send the money. I said, wait a minute. We have money [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=909.72s)]
*  that shouldn't go because we caught it before it was sent out, but they want the money to go anyway. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=913.08s)]
*  And I think you're going to have a lot of things to look at, Pam. I really do. What's going on with [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=917.16s)]
*  this whole thing. And this is just one group. We haven't talked about Department of Education. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=921.56s)]
*  We haven't talked about the military. We haven't talked about a lot of things that are very big. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=924.92s)]
*  And what's happened is as an example, you'll have cases where you have a three month contract [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=928.44s)]
*  and maybe the guy that signs a contract leaves, maybe he gets rich. All of a sudden he leaves [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=933.0s)]
*  for that reason. But you have a three month contract. So the contract is sitting there [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=936.6s)]
*  and the people signing the checks don't know it's three months and it goes on for years. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=940.6800000000001s)]
*  The three months turns out to be three years, five years, 10 years, just goes on forever. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=944.0400000000001s)]
*  And the guy on the other side of the contract just keeps getting check after check after check. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=948.84s)]
*  Because Elon had an expression yesterday because nobody cares. It's a great expression. Nobody [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=952.44s)]
*  cares. The guy that signed the contract didn't care. Maybe that may not be there. Maybe it'll [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=956.44s)]
*  be crooked. Who knows. But you have to care. Otherwise you can't really run a thing like that [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=960.9200000000001s)]
*  or you can't run a country, really. Because there's so many transactions, thousands and [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=967.48s)]
*  thousands of transactions. And if you don't have people that care, you're going to lose control. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=973.0s)]
*  And that's what's happened. And we've caught it. Now, what we call it is billions and billions [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=979.1600000000001s)]
*  of dollars, but it's a tiny fraction of the real number because you can never catch the real number [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=985.32s)]
*  because people have gotten away with tremendous amounts of money. But I said we have to make our [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=991.0s)]
*  government smaller, more efficient, more effective and a lot less expensive. And we could find a [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=997.88s)]
*  trillion dollars, but we're being hindered by courts where they file and serve. It's very hard [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1003.96s)]
*  to win. And a judge will stop us and a judge will say that it doesn't make any difference what you [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1010.6800000000001s)]
*  find. You just keep paying the money. That's a hell of a way to be. And I follow the courts. I [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1017.32s)]
*  have to follow the law. All it means is that we appeal. But that gives people time to cover their [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1022.52s)]
*  tracks. And that's what they do. So it's a very bad thing that's taking place. But hopefully, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1028.28s)]
*  if the courts will be fair, they don't have to be very fair. They just have to be [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1035.48s)]
*  a little bit fair because this is so egregious what's taking place. Nobody's ever seen anything [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1040.44s)]
*  like it. Nobody's seen numbers like this. These are massive numbers. Nine million dollars for [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1045.8s)]
*  somebody to go and stand in a store and see how people shop. Okay? I mean, you take a look at [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1050.68s)]
*  you take a look at these things. It's a disgrace. And then you have a country that we want to [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1057.24s)]
*  make America great again. It's very hard to make America great again when you have things like this. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1063.96s)]
*  And you're going to see the same thing. Department of Education is going to be a disaster. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1068.12s)]
*  The military. I mean, I see it. Look, I bought I came in. They had a contract done, as you know, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1072.84s)]
*  for 5.7 billion for airplanes. It was Air Force One with Boeing. 5.7. I got it down to 4 billion. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1079.4799999999998s)]
*  Little less than that. One penny less than that. 3 billion 999 999 and 99 cents. They said, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1090.04s)]
*  I said, has to have a three in front of it because I wouldn't sign the contract [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1097.48s)]
*  for 5.7 billion. I was able to cut $1.7 billion off the price. And it didn't take me long. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1101.16s)]
*  1.7 billion. If people would care, they'd be able to do that with every single contract that's put [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1110.44s)]
*  before them. And we wouldn't have deficits would have nothing but a tremendously low taxed, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1116.6s)]
*  wonderful country. But they have to care. And speaking of that, you know, Boeing, we're not [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1124.3600000000001s)]
*  happy with the service we're getting in terms of those planes. They would like to get more money. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1129.8000000000002s)]
*  We're not happy about they're doing too much contract. I signed a guaranteed maximum contract, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1138.0400000000002s)]
*  which I haven't seen in a long time. And they're saying they're getting hurt by it. But they have [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1144.1200000000001s)]
*  to produce the product and we expect them to produce the product. They have to produce the [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1150.36s)]
*  product. They agreed to build planes at a certain price. They're not used to that. They're used to [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1155.32s)]
*  having time and material contracts where it's whatever it costs, time and material, no dates, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1159.1599999999999s)]
*  no anything. It ends up costing five times more. You look at some of the ships. Look at the Gerald [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1166.36s)]
*  Ford, the aircraft carrier, the Ford. It came, it was supposed to cost 3 billion. It ends up [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1171.9599999999998s)]
*  costing like 18 billion. And they make, of course, all electric catapults, which don't work. And they [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1178.68s)]
*  have all magnetic elevators. They lift up 25 planes at a time, 20 planes at a time. And instead of [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1186.1200000000001s)]
*  using hydraulic, like on tractors that can handle anything from hurricanes to to lightning to [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1193.5600000000002s)]
*  anything, they use magnets. It's a new theory. Magnets are going to lift the planes up and it [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1201.5600000000002s)]
*  doesn't work. And they had billions and billions of dollars of cost overruns. I met the architect. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1207.24s)]
*  I said, have you designed a ship before? This is one of the biggest ships in the world. It's like [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1214.2s)]
*  landing at LaGuardia Airport. But you look at the kind of waste, fraud and abuse that this country's [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1218.6000000000001s)]
*  going through and we have to straighten it out. We have great people going into the military in [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1225.96s)]
*  terms of new, we need ships, we need a lot of things. We have great people, we have business [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1230.28s)]
*  people going in. But when you look at what's happened to our purchasing, the purchasing, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1234.84s)]
*  and when you look at the USAID, when you look at the things that they're giving to them, the billions, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1241.1599999999999s)]
*  the billions of dollars that they're giving to, and it doesn't make sense. It is interesting that [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1248.6799999999998s)]
*  when you're looking for fraud, you look at items, hundreds of items, and you'll find one or two, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1255.8799999999999s)]
*  maybe if you're lucky, here's something where you look at data and they're all fraudulent. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1262.44s)]
*  You know, by just looking at the topic, they're all fraudulent, except it's the opposite. You'll [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1268.2s)]
*  find one or two that's like a legitimate reason. So I just want to thank Elon for going through it. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1273.0800000000002s)]
*  I want to thank all the people that are working with him. You know, we have a big group of people, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1280.44s)]
*  all. I think the lowest IQ is about 160. That's very high. I think you have a couple of you have [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1284.04s)]
*  a couple of 182s in there, but they're doing a fantastic job. They don't, he doesn't need it, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1290.28s)]
*  and they don't need it, but we're showing things and it's going to be a, it's a big, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1296.28s)]
*  people have no idea how important it is. Yeah. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1301.96s)]
*  How soon do you want the Department of Education to be closed? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1304.04s)]
*  Oh, I'd like it to be closed immediately. Look, the Department of Education is a big con job. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1307.96s)]
*  We're ranked, so they ranked the top 40 countries in the world. We're ranked number 40th, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1313.32s)]
*  but we're ranked number one in one department costs per pupil. So we spend more per pupil than [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1318.36s)]
*  any other country in the world, but we're ranked number 40. We've been between 38 and 40. The last [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1324.52s)]
*  time I looked, it was 38. And then I looked two days ago, it came out the new list. It came out [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1330.28s)]
*  at number 40. So we're ranked 40 Norway, Denmark, Sweden, I hate to say it, China, countries, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1334.9199999999998s)]
*  famously with all private education and that's our famously privatized education. We're ranked [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1343.0s)]
*  number four famously decentralized and privatized education countries. That means something's really [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1349.08s)]
*  wrong. Right. And I say, send it back to Iowa, to Idaho, to Colorado, send it back to places that, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1352.76s)]
*  and there are a lot of Indiana. You have a great new governor. You have a [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1361.48s)]
*  great Senator that Jim Banks just got elected. You got great people. I'll tell you what, Indiana is [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1366.2s)]
*  going to be fantastic. We probably have 35, maybe 37 states that will do as well as [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1371.64s)]
*  Denmark, Norway, Finland, Sweden. They'll be just as good. Then you have, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1379.72s)]
*  then you have the ones that we all know about. It'll be the same story, but you know what, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1387.4s)]
*  even they will be good because you look at New York, you give it to Westchester County, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1391.0s)]
*  you give it to Long Island, you give it to Nassau County, you give it to Suffolk County. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1395.24s)]
*  Same thing you go out to and you give it to upstate New York. So you'd have four or five [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1399.16s)]
*  sections. You give it to Manhattan. Manhattan's a little bit tougher for some reason. I don't know [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1403.24s)]
*  why it would be tougher, but it is. You give to California and you go to various areas outside of [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1408.52s)]
*  Los Angeles and you might have six or seven different subgroups. But generally, like in, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1415.48s)]
*  if you go to Iowa, you give it to Iowa. You don't have subgroups, you have Iowa [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1421.48s)]
*  and other places that do a good job. If they do a good job, they're going to do a great [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1425.8000000000002s)]
*  job in education. Those places will be every good, every bit as good as the various countries that [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1430.52s)]
*  do so well. All the time. It's the same countries that are doing well. And so we have a Department [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1437.24s)]
*  of Education where people from Washington, D.C., who many, in many cases, don't care about [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1443.88s)]
*  the kids out in the country. They don't care about the farms and the farmer's daughter and the [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1451.32s)]
*  father's, farmer's sons. We have a massive bureaucracy in Washington, D.C. We have buildings [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1456.6s)]
*  that are all over the city. Department of Education. I never said Department of Education's [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1462.12s)]
*  on all these buildings. By the way, nobody shows up to work because they're all working at home. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1467.32s)]
*  You know, quote, working at home. They're not working at home. And a lot of them have second [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1471.4799999999998s)]
*  jobs. And that's the other thing that Elon Musk is looking at. How many of these people are getting [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1476.68s)]
*  checks, working at home, but they're not working because they have second jobs and even third jobs? [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1481.24s)]
*  You're going to find a lot of them. And those people are going to be fired because we have to [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1486.76s)]
*  make our government smaller. All right. One more question. Yeah, Jennifer, go ahead. Nice to see you. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1490.28s)]
*  Oh, thank you, sir. Two questions. One on Ukraine again, and then another one on the Kennedy Center. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1496.3600000000001s)]
*  Do you think that by as far as your negotiating tactics go, did Pete Hegseth take away some of [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1501.96s)]
*  your negotiating abilities with Putin by taking Ukraine's sovereign integrity off the table by [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1508.2800000000002s)]
*  taking no, I haven't done that. I'm back in Ukraine. I'm back in Ukraine. Don't say that. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1515.16s)]
*  I'm approving, but I do want security for our money. You know, Europe is getting security. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1521.24s)]
*  You know that, right? They're giving their money in the form of a loan. Nobody knows that. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1526.68s)]
*  And why are we at $350 billion and Europe, which doesn't separate with an ocean like we do, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1531.64s)]
*  we have a little thing called an ocean in between. Why is it that Europe is paying [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1538.36s)]
*  $200 billion less than us to help Ukraine? Very similar size. If you add up all the European [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1543.64s)]
*  countries, it's a little bit smaller than the U.S. in terms of the economy. Why is it that they're [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1549.24s)]
*  not paying the kind of numbers that they should be paying? And then on top of it, and I've been [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1554.68s)]
*  saying this to Biden, I told Biden, I said, you ought to be asking for either a loan or some kind [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1560.6s)]
*  of a security, like their oil and gas or something for the money, because money, then Europe, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1565.6399999999999s)]
*  and you have no security. Europe's putting up a much smaller amount, and it's in the form of a [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1572.1999999999998s)]
*  loan because we have people that were incompetent in the last administration, grossly incompetent, [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1576.6s)]
*  and we're changing it. But we change it, and all we do is we get hit by lawsuits from the radical [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1583.8799999999999s)]
*  left all the time. But here we are. We stand and I guess we've done okay. Thank you very much, [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1589.16s)]
*  everybody. Thank you. Thank you. Thank God Donald Trump ended it just in time for PlayStation state [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1594.76s)]

*  Yeah, that's probably why he's a big PlayStation head. I think I can't wait for 20, 28 when Biden [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vbN9FAj2o&t=1625.0s)]
