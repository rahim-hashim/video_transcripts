*  has always been a the number one Drake rider for extended periods of time it is [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=393.96s)]
*  not surprising to me that this collaboration with X you see came right [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=400.08s)]
*  after 8m Ross left the platform kick surprise he was not on a stream no I I [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=403.76s)]
*  think I think there's a reason for why Oh Drake calls Steve Lacey his fragile [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=409.2s)]
*  op after he plays music on stream he also got mad at this as well I don't [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=414.76s)]
*  know why he had smoke for Steve Lacey [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=418.4s)]
*  this guy's like a fragile up but it's a good song though it's a fragile up okay [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=422.4s)]
*  interesting why is he up why is he a fragile up okay so what does that mean [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=428.2s)]
*  oh cuz he's from Compton he was at Kendrick's concert no chat fragility [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=436.79999999999995s)]
*  interesting actually we need Drake trying to start be with Lacey call him a [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=442.47999999999996s)]
*  fragile already backfired Steve Lacey posted Drake get lonely on his [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=447.28s)]
*  Instagram and then posted what Lamar would in the oh no with the sizzle like [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=452.5s)]
*  who trying to be my fragile up these are the guys from the NFR pockets Drake [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=457.79999999999995s)]
*  mentioned the lawsuit by the way [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=462.55999999999995s)]
*  Drake put these guys in a Rico yeah Steve was on stage during the pop-out [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=468.52s)]
*  that Kendrick did and among all the affiliated members from LA Drake decided [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=474.0s)]
*  to go after Steve instead of anyone else on that stage I wonder why he chose to [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=479.2s)]
*  go after Steve who is you know a relatively new artist on the scene [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=483.0s)]
*  anyway like he Steve Lacey got like I mean he popped off on tiktok originally [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=487.52s)]
*  right what's is that they're both huge Drake fans to know he isn't what do you [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=491.4s)]
*  he's not new he's been around okay well I didn't know I don't listen to music I [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=496.44s)]
*  just like the drama [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=502.0s)]
*  oh he was on odd future oh I didn't know that I'm a change good [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=507.52s)]
*  Amazon color and it's good Amazon he was popular before tiktok he's been around [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=512.0799999999999s)]
*  but he did pop off big on tiktok yeah I didn't know that I didn't know that he [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=516.72s)]
*  was on future but anyway regardless I think Drake calling anybody a fragile op [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=520.36s)]
*  is pretty funny especially considering that he's so fragile that the mere [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=526.12s)]
*  mention of Steve Lacey's music is enough for him to be triggered also Drake is so [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=530.04s)]
*  disrespectful to DJ academics and Los pollos like there's hella people who [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=535.44s)]
*  have been Drake writers from the jump and like he did not entertain a single [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=540.76s)]
*  one of their broadcast and he went straight to XQC kind of wild oh also [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=546.2s)]

*  that really popped off which friend of the show our boy Sean the black also got [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=603.0400000000001s)]

*  about him in a negative way I have not seen a single person that watched the [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=707.04s)]
*  execution that was like yo Drake is so sick on this stream like they're there [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=710.8s)]
*  you know it's not good PR it's objectively bad press which is a thing [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=714.88s)]
*  that exists okay there's no there's no like oh all all presses good press like [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=721.0799999999999s)]
*  no it doesn't work that way I think part of it is he sees how cool Kai's [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=725.76s)]
*  artist collabs are and he thought he could do the same okay first of all I [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=728.7199999999999s)]
*  think Kai would probably have Drake on if Drake wanted to go on Kai's in that [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=732.0400000000001s)]
*  stream it might be difficult logistically because it's in Los [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=735.84s)]
*  Angeles but like I'm certain that Kai would have him on what are you talking [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=738.5600000000001s)]

*  that I've actually made fun of Drake like a lot here are three things that I [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=794.18s)]
*  think are actually kind of cool about Drake that I will always fucking [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=799.62s)]
*  respect him for one I think the knock the shit is not trash I think knocked [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=804.42s)]
*  us some of the some of the pieces from knock that are kind of cool okay sorry [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=810.22s)]
*  that's what I think number two he has an NBA indoor basketball court in his house [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=815.22s)]
*  that is literally the best thing you can do with your money okay that's just true [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=821.78s)]
*  it doesn't matter it does not matter you fucking put a full-size NBA regulation [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=828.86s)]
*  basketball court indoor court in your house that's fire okay if Drake actually [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=837.14s)]
*  invited me to go play basketball at the indoor basketball court I might actually [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=843.02s)]
*  drop all my convictions okay I'll just say it I have said no to remember chat [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=846.8199999999999s)]
*  one million dollars on the election night on the election day broadcast [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=852.66s)]
*  coverage from polymarket the company that got raided by the FBI their [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=858.26s)]
*  starting point was one million dollars they were like oh we're coming into the [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=862.38s)]
*  conversation we'll give you a million fucking dollars for one day and I said [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=865.22s)]
*  no to that having said that I will drop my convictions if I get to play in an [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=869.72s)]
*  indoor NBA basketball regulation court I feel like that's super sick and last [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=874.28s)]
*  but not least he has been one of the more vocal one of the largest artists [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=880.08s)]
*  that has been vocal at you know and then pro-palestine from the jump partially [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=886.52s)]
*  because he's from Toronto and he's surrounded by a lot of like Arab [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=892.48s)]
*  North African dudes a lot of Muslim dudes in his crew so you know balls and [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=896.84s)]
*  strikes those are three I think fair things to say about Drake okay especially [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=902.36s)]
*  the last one that one is a big one I think he I mean weekend still clears them [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=907.64s)]
*  on that front but I mean listen weekend has done a shit-tongue more than Drake [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=912.0s)]
*  but overall he was early on he literally did nothing but sign that [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=916.96s)]
*  letter one year ago do you have other proof okay but that's still a big fucking [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=922.2s)]
*  deal when you're Drake dog what are you talking about and it was super early too [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=925.92s)]
*  like he was probably one of the first that was one of the first fucking major [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=929.4s)]
*  artists that came out of the gay swingin like that was a fucking year ago [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=933.4s)]

*  yeah October 30th 2023 that's insane and I will always listen I will always [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=940.76s)]
*  respect that he signed the artist for ceasefire letter on October 30th October [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=947.48s)]
*  30th 2024 he called for a fucking ceasefire in Palestine before Bernie [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=954.48s)]
*  Sanders did okay yes Abel has donated millions he's been infinitely more vocal [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=959.32s)]
*  about a support for Palestinian emancipation 2023 sorry not 2024 I [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=966.6s)]

*  for the most part but like no I I'm gonna be honest like why the fuck would I [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=983.76s)]
*  lie I see no reason to lie my job here my job here isn't to just like fucking [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=988.6s)]

*  to lie yes when I tell you I haven't fucked your mom last night that's a lie [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=1004.36s)]
*  I can't believe he did this he is such a fucking cornball dude like trying to [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=1008.72s)]
*  take legal action against his own distributor dude what an insane thing to [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROp6kvENTk&t=1015.1600000000001s)]
