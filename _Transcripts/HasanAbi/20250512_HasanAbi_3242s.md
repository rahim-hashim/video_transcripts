**HasanAbi:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA)
*  as some of you may know, I'm somewhat of an experienced traveler. And usually as an [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=0.0s)]
*  experienced traveler, I like to get to the shot, they go to airport early because I know, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=5.68s)]
*  no disrespect to France. I love the country, but Chartergoll airport is one of the worst in Europe. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  It's a major hub, but unfortunately due to, I think like a lack of interest from the managers [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=18.88s)]
*  of any of these companies where they, they just refuse to hire additional people. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=27.92s)]

*  we have so many news to cover as well, which is why I'm very early as a matter of fact, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=97.44s)]
*  because I'll be heading over to university of Chicago, the mean streets. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=103.84s)]

*  This is the part of the broadcast where I tell you about my personal news about what's going on [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=150.56s)]
*  in the world of a song house and I've been playing in between the time period where I press the stop [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=155.36s)]
*  streaming button and press the star streaming button. Someone said, bro, men and show reposted [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=158.24s)]
*  my aura edit of them. Good. Yeah. His social media team is great. His social media team is excellent, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=161.52s)]

*  I have a lot to tell you yesterday. I did not actually broadcast for some, some interesting news. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=189.44s)]
*  Once again, pre-watched, Piker struck again. I remember I was joking about like what I [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=196.95999999999998s)]
*  foresaw would potentially happen as I entered the United States of America. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=203.44s)]
*  And that thing that I foresaw happening actually ended up happening. And I'm obviously going to [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=208.48s)]
*  talk about it really quickly, but I guess before I do that, I should probably blast off [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=213.68s)]
*  that I'm live Hassan on me. Thank you for the 50 gifted. For those of you who don't know, I've was, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=219.6s)]
*  I was detained by a customs and border patrol. I was tactically ascertained and, and engaged in [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=224.56s)]
*  a kinetic situation where I was kinetically moved into a detention center inside of the O'Hare [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=232.08s)]
*  airport, which I will tell you all about in a second, man, didn't pass the ocular pat down. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=237.52s)]
*  I believe it was a, before the ocular pat down is the flight manifest that they get ahead of time. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=245.52s)]
*  They knew who I was and they were ready to, they were ready to receive me. Let's just say, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=251.28s)]
*  and it wasn't a very warm welcome. So what's happening? What's happening in Chicago? What the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=257.84000000000003s)]
*  was that? You know, this is my only, my second time coming back here. And the first time I was [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=263.84s)]
*  here for the DNC got kicked out second time. I couldn't even enter the state almost. Okay. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=268.88s)]
*  But yeah, we'll, I'll, I'll tell you all about it. Let me just blast off real quick. Cause there's [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=274.79999999999995s)]
*  so much news to cover. I'm in shy rack talking about my ICBP detention, Trump, China trade deals, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=279.03999999999996s)]
*  Trump side stepping, Israel on releasing US POW on his Mideast tour and so much and, and much more. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=291.76s)]
*  Later, I will head to uni of Chicago to do a talk with a stead earned in Chicago blast off meme. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=307.2s)]
*  Oh, you got a good one. Let me see. Okay. I like that one. That's good. And then get in now. Okay. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=324.32s)]
*  We have so much, dude. It's like live streamed this dead her and get in now, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=333.04s)]
*  very amount of stuff happening in the world of a son house and I'll be piker. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=340.0s)]
*  And yeah, that's I unfortunately was not there to participate in fear. And this week they shot it [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=344.16s)]
*  without me while I was in France, Viva la France. I do be flying pretty often and have been detained [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=351.20000000000005s)]
*  by customs. They just Google your ass while they make you wait. Yeah. Yeah. Pretty much. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=356.88s)]
*  You're not wrong chatter. But yeah, it's definitely an interesting experience. Let me tell you. Okay. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=363.04s)]
*  Let me tell you, you're looking rather angelic today. What is this guy saying? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=370.0s)]
*  Hassan, my favorite supporter. He tried to bring up deserved actual terrorists, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=374.40000000000003s)]
*  deserved actual terrorists, tried to bring them, deserved actual chatter. There's nothing funnier [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=378.8s)]
*  than there's nothing funnier than fantasizing that I actually brought up to O'Hare airport. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=385.36s)]
*  And then they just let me go. Like in your mind, in your mind, you think it's unfathomable that [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=391.76s)]
*  like someone who is a political commentator would get apprehended for no reason and, and will [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=398.8s)]
*  like simply be harassed specifically to create a chilling effect on speech. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=407.36s)]
*  So do you think that that is ridiculous? And I understand why you would think that's ridiculous. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=413.59999999999997s)]
*  So you have to turn around and fantasize that I brought them to the airport and I'm a tech [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=417.92s)]
*  except is that tech tone? Yeah. I accept also in that same fantasy, woke ass customs and border [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=422.88s)]
*  patrol actually let me go after I brought them in your, in your assessment. You know, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=430.72s)]
*  Chicago remembers a good Kanye and cries about the bad Kanye. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=436.96000000000004s)]
*  So a lot going on, a lot going on in the world. Okay. We'll get to it. We'll get to it right now. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=443.36s)]
*  Did you touch the bean? No, man. I haven't done shit. I actually spent last night with this dead, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=449.6s)]
*  hung out with him, went to some bars and, and, you know, hung out in the city for a little bit, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=456.08s)]
*  had a couple of drinks, but that's it. That's all I did yesterday. I landed, I got in, I got detained. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=463.44s)]
*  It was way too late for me to stream. And I saw, I was like, fuck it. I'm not going to stream. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=470.16s)]
*  And I took a shower. I went out to the bars and that's it. That's all I did in Chicago. So far, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=476.08000000000004s)]
*  I did not lick the bean. I didn't touch the bean. I didn't have time to flick the bean. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=482.56s)]
*  What bars you go to? Nothing good. Start off the story at Charley golf, three hours, man. Yeah. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=488.24s)]
*  That's where I'm going to start. I thought I saw your ass at a bar. Maybe I did get recognized a [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=493.20000000000005s)]
*  bunch. I also got recognized while I was walking out of the fucking ice detention. But I don't think [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=499.12s)]
*  the two Hassan Abbe has that recognized me had any idea that I was like walking out with an ice agent. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=505.6s)]
*  They just saw me. They just saw me walk out and they were like, Oh my God, Hassan little. Do they [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=510.48s)]
*  know I was actually, I was actually walking out of ice detainment. But yeah, the feds dude, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=515.6s)]
*  they're praying on my downfall. Hold on. Hello. Yes. No, it's fine. You can cancel that then. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=521.6s)]
*  Yeah. Yes. Thank you. All right. Bye. Yeah. That was the feds. Mushy, mushy. No business deals. No, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=526.56s)]
*  they don't just don't have sugar free rebel. Anyway. So, all right. Where do I begin? Our story [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=537.28s)]
*  begins at Paris's premier international airport shot. They go. Okay. Now normally I'm an experienced [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=543.52s)]
*  traveler. As some of you may know, I'm somewhat of an experienced traveler. And usually as an [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=554.24s)]
*  experienced traveler, I like to get to the shot, they go to airport early. Cause I know, no [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=560.56s)]
*  disrespect to France. I love the country, but Charter goal airport is one of the worst in Europe. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=568.3199999999999s)]
*  It's a major hub, but unfortunately due to, I think like a lack of interest from the managers [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=573.8399999999999s)]
*  of any of these companies where they, they just refuse to hire additional people. And I feel like [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=582.8s)]
*  in France, you just have to always hire more people because everyone is doing work very slowly. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=588.8s)]
*  Okay. It's just the pace that you have to adjust to. And therefore you have to hire more people. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=594.4s)]
*  There's always like work stoppages and stuff like that. And these guys, the unions are, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=600.0799999999999s)]
*  are relatively powerful, but the corporate overlords will literally punish travelers [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=605.76s)]
*  instead of meeting the actual demands of labor unions there. So I I've been in a situation where [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=611.2s)]
*  I've been like stuck in France and stuff, like I had to do crazy maneuvering to get out. So I knew [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=618.32s)]
*  that. And because I knew that I was like, I'll go three hours early. It's something that I never do. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=624.0s)]
*  Usually I'm actually very slow, but this time I was like, I'll go three hours early and everything [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=629.5200000000001s)]
*  will be fine. I was already worried that I was going to, I was going to have issues coming into [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=637.2s)]
*  the country. I had joked about it already. So I was like, at least on the one side, like leaving [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=643.76s)]
*  the country of France will not be that big of a problem. And boy, was I wrong. Okay. Boy was I [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=647.9200000000001s)]
*  wrong. So I hit the triple Monte. I, I, I had like a generational run. I, I, there was massive traffic [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=657.2800000000001s)]
*  going in the, when you, when you actually drive into the airport, the person that's dropping you [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=665.92s)]
*  off has to get a gate ticket at the gate. The ticket actually didn't work. Like, so we were stuck [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=670.9599999999999s)]
*  in traffic with like other cars behind us. Like my driver had to get out and be like, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=677.4399999999999s)]
*  and wave people away from the gate so that we could actually get to a gate that worked all this [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=681.68s)]
*  stuff. Right. And I'm like, Oh brother, here we go. Walk in. I mean, I already I'm flying business. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=686.4s)]
*  So like I have sky priority. So I'm thinking like, Oh, at least I'll be able to get my luggage in on [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=692.08s)]
*  time. Barely made it to the check-in. Okay. There was already a, there was, I mean, there was already [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=697.2800000000001s)]
*  issues with the check-in. Once I got through the check-in, I got hit at every single step. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=704.08s)]
*  There's an automatic, there's an automatic passport processor where you just kind of step into this [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=710.88s)]
*  room and then boop doors open. You walk in, right? I wait in line. There's only one, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=716.64s)]
*  none of the machines are working. Finally, I get to the machine that is working and the machine is, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=722.88s)]
*  the machine stops working. It just won't take my passport. It won't take my fucking passport. I was [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=728.64s)]

*  me through so I could get in. Then I got stuck behind classic old lady. Okay. Old lady with a [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=743.04s)]
*  lot of bags with a lot of fluids. So then like she's taking her fluids out and then like doing [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=749.68s)]
*  all this stuff at the security gate. I'm stuck behind this person. I already took out all my [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=755.4399999999999s)]

*  brother yelled at me over and over again, telling me you gotta get, you gotta get global entry, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=848.96s)]
*  whatever. Right? I get to the global entry line and they're processing everybody expeditiously. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=855.76s)]
*  You walk up, boom, you walk up immediately. They take your photo of your face and you walk in and [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=861.6800000000001s)]

*  step aside, sir. An agent will come in and take you to another location. I was like, like, is that, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=892.6400000000001s)]
*  is that proper protocol? It's like, sometimes it happens. And I was like, okay. And I knew at that [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=898.0s)]
*  point I was like, okay, I'm texting like family. I'm like, this is happening. I'm texting my manager. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=904.32s)]

*  happen? And I had already, I had already heard like horror stories from people. There was like [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=920.96s)]
*  that one girl on tick-tock that had talked about this. And I thought to myself, all right, it's [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=928.5600000000001s)]
*  done. It's happening to me as well. It is what it is. You know, M is real high. I'm about to say M is [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=933.6s)]
*  real high multiple times to get these guys off my back. So I'm waiting in the corner. This Latina [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=940.88s)]
*  ice agent comes up, picks me up, takes me to this detention center. I sit down fluorescent light [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=950.0s)]
*  bulbs, the whole nine. Okay. They have benches in the back of O'Hare airport where there's like a, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=956.1600000000001s)]
*  there's like a detention area. Okay. There's a detention area. I'm sitting there. There's [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=964.24s)]
*  like a bunch of terrified families. Okay. There's an old lady in a wheelchair. There's like a mom and [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=969.44s)]
*  mom and daughter behind me. There's some like random dude in front of me. And the way it works is [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=977.12s)]
*  there's two, there's a back door, right? And they take your passport. They go to the back door. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=984.4s)]
*  You don't know what the hell's going on in there, but they sometimes come out and they just say [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=991.68s)]
*  someone's name with their passport in their hands and they go, you're clear to leave. So they, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=996.24s)]
*  they basically, when they bring you to the detention area, they, I guess, do some kind of [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1001.1999999999999s)]
*  surveillance on your, on your background to figure out if you are, you know, if you're [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1006.4s)]
*  going to get harassed even further, or if this level of harassment is fine. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1014.24s)]
*  Okay. And I asked, and I looked around at all the passports that people had to see if there were [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1019.28s)]
*  other American citizens and lo and behold, at least in the area that I was at, I was the only [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1025.44s)]
*  American citizen. There was another guy that actually had an American passport as well. But [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1031.04s)]
*  like, cause I asked the, the, the terrified family behind me. I was like, Hey guys, if you don't mind [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1036.6399999999999s)]
*  me asking, like, do you guys have an American passport? And they were like, no. So it turns out [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1042.1599999999999s)]
*  it's just, they're terrifying the shit out of mostly non-American citizens. Okay. But apparently [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1046.96s)]
*  they're also interested in trying to terrify American citizens as well. So they, they're just [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1052.56s)]
*  like coming in and out. They get this lady in a wheelchair out of there, which I thought was so [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1060.24s)]
*  insane. Old lady in a fucking wheelchair is in the ice detention area. And they come out with their [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1064.8s)]
*  passport and they're like, here you can leave. Okay. So that's one thing, right? Like I've had [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1072.32s)]
*  secondary searches and stuff done to me before I've had the, I think it's called the, the, the [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1080.64s)]
*  quadruple S like they put the SSSS on your, on your boarding pass and you always get checked [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1086.32s)]
*  randomly when you get hit with that. Like that's happened to me a lot in the past. I get GSR swabbed [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1094.24s)]
*  all the time. That stuff is normal. I've, I've experienced that quite a bit. Okay. But this time [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1099.36s)]
*  I didn't even have the quadruple S on my boarding pass. So I was like, all right, it's probably fine. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1105.9199999999998s)]
*  So I wait, I wait, I wait, I wait. Finally, this agent comes out, says Hassan piker. I'm like, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1110.0s)]
*  as me coming with me, I'm like, Oh brother, here we go. They take me to this back room. Okay. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1119.04s)]
*  And the back room is not great. Everything. The back room is, is designed in the most hostile way [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1127.2s)]
*  I've ever been inside of a room. The vibes are really fucked back there. Everything is fluorescent [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1134.64s)]
*  light bulb. Obviously, but they had these two seats that were, that were firmly planted into [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1139.92s)]
*  the ground. Okay. They were complete metal. They, they were like tiny stools, very uncomfortable [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1151.2s)]
*  with like braces on the side so you can handcuff someone to them. Okay. And there was also a seat [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1159.1999999999998s)]
*  for like a lawyer. So I sat down on the lawyer seat on the corner to establish dominance because [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1166.6399999999999s)]
*  I've watched too many JCS interrogation videos. And I knew I had to have command over the room. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1172.1599999999999s)]
*  So I didn't sit in the, in the cook chair. Instead, I sat in the lawyer chair and we got to talking. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1178.9599999999998s)]
*  And let me tell you folks, the tick talkers that talked about being detained, they were right. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1185.36s)]
*  It was an insane fucking situation. So it's very obvious that they knew exactly who the fuck I was. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1193.04s)]
*  It's very obvious that they knew how to like navigate the commerce. And, and it was a really, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1201.4399999999998s)]
*  really interesting conversation that took place. It was very cordial. Okay. It was very cordial, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1207.9199999999998s)]
*  which I noticed, I thought it was strange how cordial it was. Cause I've had run-ins with like [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1213.44s)]
*  cops in the past. I've had run-ins with feds in the past. Well, I guess the FBI was very cordial [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1218.96s)]
*  as well when I had some talks with them in the past, but overall I was not expecting CBP agents [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1224.3200000000002s)]
*  to be cordial. I will say that. Okay. Now having said that the entire process is supposed to be [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1232.88s)]
*  intimidating. So it's fucking bullshit, like suck my dick cordial or whatever. Okay. I think they [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1240.32s)]
*  were being cordial because they wanted me to say something that was incriminating and say something [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1247.04s)]
*  that was enough to justify further detention from that point on. And let me tell you, they certainly [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1252.56s)]
*  did do that. So he knew exactly who the fuck I was, but he was basically like broaching the conversation [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1258.72s)]
*  in a way where it was like free flowing, where in the process of discovery, he was adding on [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1264.88s)]
*  additional talking points. He always made it seem as though he was asking certain things that [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1270.5600000000002s)]
*  after discovering in the process of that conversation, he would ask additional questions. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1278.0800000000002s)]
*  So, you know, he's like, Oh, what are you doing in Chicago? And I was very revealing. I was like, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1282.24s)]
*  well, I was in France because I was in France because I want to take my family out for mother's [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1286.48s)]
*  day to France. But I had to come back early from France, even though today's technically mother's [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1292.56s)]
*  day, because I have a speaking engagement at university of Chicago. And he was like, Oh, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1296.1599999999999s)]
*  what kind of speaking engagement? It's like, I don't know some like journalism school stuff. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1301.44s)]
*  And he's like, Oh, well, since you mentioned that he would, he kept saying, Oh, well, since you [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1304.8799999999999s)]
*  mentioned that, what do you do as a job? And I was like, I'm a Twitch streamer. And he's like, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1311.12s)]
*  well, since you mentioned that you were a Twitch streamer, what kind of things do you stream about? [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1316.88s)]
*  And at first I was like, do I just tell them I play video games? Cause I don't think this [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1322.96s)]
*  motherfucker is going to believe me if I say I just play video games to them. Right? So I was just [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1326.5600000000002s)]
*  like, yeah, I play video games, but I also do a current events, sometimes drama, internet. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1331.0400000000002s)]
*  And he's like, Oh, do you talk about, since you mentioned that you talk about the things that you [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1337.5200000000002s)]
*  talk about, do you talk about the news? And I was like, yeah, I talk about the news. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1342.4s)]
*  And he, and he kept saying, okay, so when you talk about the news, do you talk about the war? [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1347.6000000000001s)]
*  And I was like, what do you mean by that? He's like, do you talk about Trump? And that was the [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1352.96s)]
*  first time where I was like, what the fuck is this question? Like I literally straight up told him, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1358.0800000000002s)]
*  I was like, why are you asking me this? Like, I was like, what does this have to do with anything? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1362.48s)]
*  And, and it was interesting because they, like the dude asked so many, so many insane questions, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1369.52s)]
*  none of which is illegal by the way. I just need you to understand nothing I have done [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1381.76s)]
*  thus far is illegal as in nothing I've done online is illegal as of now, if that makes sense. Now [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1386.56s)]
*  laws may change in the future and they might actually start prosecuting speech, which I do [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1397.44s)]
*  fear is, is the goal of this administration. But so far everything I've done is fully protected [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1403.04s)]
*  under the first amendment. Okay. And none of these questions are actually valid questions to ask, [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1409.8400000000001s)]
*  but I was entertaining it because I didn't want it one, I didn't want to present it as being [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1418.3200000000002s)]
*  difficult because I didn't want to extend the tension. And two, I actually wanted to see how [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1422.8s)]
*  far I could take it. Maybe it was fucked up of me to do that. Maybe it was not appropriate for me [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1428.0s)]
*  to do that, to play fast and loose with a person that has complete control over my life in that [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1433.52s)]
*  very moment. But I wanted to see like, what was, what they were trying to get away, like what they [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1439.04s)]
*  were trying to take from this conversation. And so, you know, instead of, instead of just pleading [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1446.96s)]
*  the fifth, as I'm supposed to do in situations like this, I just kept, I just kept giving him [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1456.8s)]
*  answers. And there were definitely areas where I was, was very revealing about my position, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1462.32s)]
*  knowing full well that they know exactly what they're looking for. I saw no reason to hold back [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1470.56s)]
*  on certain things. So I said, I don't like Trump. I was like, what are you going to do? It's, it's [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1476.8s)]
*  protected by the first amendment. I don't like Trump. Yes. Right. Like I was like, I'm not fond [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1482.3999999999999s)]
*  of him. I don't like him. He said he was going to end the wars. He hasn't ended the wars. What the [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1487.28s)]
*  fuck is up with that? You know, and the guy actually was very sympathetic. The agent was very sympathetic, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1492.3999999999999s)]
*  JCS style interrogation technique to come across as sympathetic to like invoke some, some kind of [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1499.52s)]
*  positive feelings out of me in an effort to like get me to reveal something maybe that'll trip me up [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1506.24s)]
*  or because he just genuinely was sympathetic. And he had the vibes of someone who was like, I don't [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1511.68s)]
*  know why I'm doing this. Right. But he was like, listen, I'm Iraqi. So I know. And let me tell you, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1516.24s)]
*  I do think that him being a rocky played a big role in this because if he wasn't, there was a [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1522.16s)]
*  lot of fucking redditor ass white boys that are at a costumes and border patrol at O'Hare airport. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1527.44s)]
*  I saw them. I saw them walk by. There was a dude who looked like he was like 25 max, but he was [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1532.8s)]
*  balding. And I knew immediately if that motherfucker is my agent, I'm screwed. I'm going to seek out. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1537.68s)]
*  This dude is going to literally fucking cook me. So I got a little lucky. I got a little lucky. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1543.1200000000001s)]
*  All right. I will admit. So basically I think the reason why they sent the Iraqi CBP agent is because [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1548.88s)]
*  they bracket you into different categories. For me, they wanted to conduct an investigation [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1557.04s)]
*  about my involvement with Hamas and my involvement with the Houthis and my, or they suspected my [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1562.16s)]
*  involvement with Hezbollah straight up. That's literally what this conversation was about. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1569.44s)]
*  And it's not even a joke. Like they literally, they straight up fucking tried to get something [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1576.0s)]
*  out of me that, that I think they could use to basically detain me permanently, which is insane. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1582.8000000000002s)]
*  Because there is no direct connection or direct involvement. So I'll say this much. So we're [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1592.96s)]
*  talking, we're talking, you know, I'm telling him like, Oh, I'm you Chicago. I'm going to be speaking [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1598.96s)]
*  there for the journalism school. I told him like, you know, I don't like Donald Trump. And I was [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1605.28s)]
*  like, so why are you guys doing this? And he's like, Oh, it's just like routine. It's a routine [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1610.16s)]
*  process. I was like, it doesn't feel too routine. And basically my big fear from the entire [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1614.8s)]
*  situation was like, if they were to ask for my phone, not that there's anything incriminating [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1622.96s)]
*  on my phone, but I don't want the fucking federal government inside of my phone beyond the, you know, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1627.44s)]
*  beyond all of the times where they probably have been engaging in like warrantless surveillance on [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1632.08s)]
*  my phone or whatever the fuck I don't like, it's not your business. You know what I mean? It's none [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1637.52s)]
*  of your fucking business. So you it's a goddamn free country. Like there's privacy laws for this [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1641.52s)]
*  kind of shit. Right? So for those of you who don't know, by the way, they can't actually unlock your [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1645.28s)]
*  phone. But if you have biometrics on your phone, they could technically use that and put the phone [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1651.28s)]
*  to your face and unlock it that way. Hold on. Let me fix this. Let me fix the banner. So just so you [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1656.72s)]
*  know, they could technically do that. Okay. They could technically do that. But there's a trick. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1663.92s)]
*  Either you completely either you get a burner phone when you're traveling internationally, [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1670.8799999999999s)]
*  or if you have your regular phone, you can just do a passcode by either canceling biometrics, or [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1676.1599999999999s)]
*  if you forgot to do so, if you forgot to cancel biometrics, like your face ID, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1684.32s)]
*  what you can do is click it five times. If you click hold five times in a row, it will actually, [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1689.52s)]
*  it will actually disable face ID. And it will force you to put your passcode in. And because [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1697.6000000000001s)]
*  there are laws against like the agents not being able to force you to put your passcode in, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1704.88s)]
*  they can't actually access your phone like that. Now there's different methods of how they can [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1709.2s)]
*  access your phone. From what I understand, they can also put it on a computer and just like plug [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1714.5600000000002s)]
*  it into a machine. And the machine just basically takes all of the information on your phone. So [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1719.1200000000001s)]
*  it is what it is. I don't know if you can actually do that if your phone is on, but I was [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1724.16s)]
*  thinking about all these things. I had already unlocked the biometrics, like I disallowed biometrics [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1730.16s)]
*  and it's a Faraday cage. Once you get into the detention center anyway, so you can't actually [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1735.92s)]
*  send any fucking text messages. Once you're in there, it's there's no, there's no access to the [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1740.88s)]
*  internet, but I'm sitting there and they're asking me about Trump. They're asking me about like [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1746.24s)]
*  Hamas and, and he kept saying stuff. He kept saying stuff like, do you like Hamas? Like, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1753.6s)]
*  do you support Hamas? Do you think Hamas is a resistance group? Do you think Hamas is a [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1760.9599999999998s)]
*  terrorist group or a resistance group? Like he just kept asking over and over again. Right. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1765.84s)]
*  And I kept repeating the same statement over and over. I want, I kept saying a couple of different [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1772.0s)]
*  things. One in terms of like Israel and all the wars, I was like, I'm on the side of civilians. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1777.36s)]
*  I want the endless bloodshed to end. I am a pacifist. I want wars to end. I just kept [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1781.44s)]
*  repeating that over and over again. Every single time he asked me a question, I just kept repeating [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1787.2s)]
*  that. And every single time he asked me a question, leading a leading question about Hamas, [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1791.1200000000001s)]
*  I kept saying the United States state department recognizes Hamas as a terrorist organization. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1795.76s)]
*  The United States state department recognizes Hamas as a terrorist organization. So like he [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1800.96s)]
*  just kept asking me over and over again, like Hamas, Houthis, all this shit trying to be like, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1807.12s)]
*  Oh, do you support them? Do you like them? Like, what do you think about them? Which I thought was [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1812.8799999999999s)]
*  fucking insane because the reality of the matter is, okay, up until this very moment, up until this [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1817.9199999999998s)]
*  very moment, if you were to say as an American citizen, you stand 10 toes down with Hamas or [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1824.56s)]
*  you stand 10 toes down with the Houthis or whatever the fuck they can't deny you entry into the country [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1830.08s)]
*  for that shit. But I don't know what the fuck they're trying to do. So I was like, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1834.64s)]
*  I'm not going to go beyond it. I'm not going to go beyond just like repeating, reiterating over [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1839.1200000000001s)]
*  and over again, the American government's position is that Hamas is a terrorist organization. But then [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1843.2800000000002s)]
*  he just kept asking me about the Houthis. And at that point I was like, listen, he's like, well, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1849.8400000000001s)]
*  do you agree with the terrorist designation for the Houthis? And I said, I'm of the Brookings [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1855.6000000000001s)]
*  Institute mindset that in 2020, when Donald Trump initially designated the Houthis as a terror [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1859.76s)]
*  organization, that was a major mistake. I talk about these issues from an academic context [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1865.52s)]
*  with humanitarian rights organizations and with academics and with journalists. As a matter of [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1870.4s)]
*  fact, this is perfectly like, this is, you know, completely protected under first amendment laws. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1875.2s)]
*  And therefore, you know, I don't understand what the, what the reason why we're having this [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1882.72s)]
*  conversation is. And I kept saying that over and over again, at which point he just like kind of [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1886.8s)]
*  gave up. But what I thought was really interesting was, and I even followed it up with like, I do [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1891.04s)]
*  call Bosnia. I said, I call balls and strikes and I, you know, there are things that Trump has done [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1898.6399999999999s)]
*  that I actually agree with. And I'm not shy about saying those things, even though initially he said [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1904.56s)]
*  he was going to end all these wars. He hasn't done so. I think these wars are unnecessary. They're [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1909.68s)]
*  costly. And a lot of civilians die in the process. I don't think it's appropriate. I think it's very [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1914.0s)]
*  inappropriate. And it must end right like that. That's my position. But I do think that Trump did [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1921.12s)]
*  a good thing where he implemented a ceasefire with the Houthis. So when he does stuff like that, [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1927.68s)]
*  I, when I agree with him, I tell him what's what, like I say it when I agree with Trump in a decision, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1932.48s)]
*  I'm open about it. Right. So I explained that to him. And I just yapped away over and over and over [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1939.92s)]
*  again. And what I found to be particularly interesting was in the first half of the [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1948.16s)]
*  conversation, it was just like basically a fact-finding mission, right? Try to get me to [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1955.28s)]
*  say something that I think would be of interest. And the second part of the conversation, there [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1960.4s)]
*  were some real actionable items that he presented that depending on how I answer those questions, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1966.16s)]
*  like I'm fucking going to jail because the first stuff was just illegal for him to ask me those [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1972.8000000000002s)]
*  questions and completely like completely idiotic and ridiculous. And I think they did it because [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1977.52s)]
*  they know who the fuck I am. And they wanted to, they wanted to, to put the fear of God into me, [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1985.0400000000002s)]
*  not knowing that I'm a stubborn piece of shit. And I, you know, that's not going to work at all. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1993.6s)]
*  Right. The second half of the conversation was actually like, cause he left when 30, 35 minutes [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=1999.04s)]
*  came back and then he asked like actionable items. But one thing that I will take note of that I [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2004.7199999999998s)]
*  thought was very interesting was the fact that a lot of the shit that like the Ethan Klein's of the [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2011.12s)]
*  world have like cried about over and over again, were unironically brought up in that fucking [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2020.16s)]
*  conversation. And I was shocked. I was shocked. Okay. Not like the bleach sort, obviously, but like [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2025.8400000000001s)]
*  the Huthy, like, did you interview a Huthy? It says here that you interviewed a Huthy. And I was like, [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2033.44s)]
*  or was he actually a Huthy? And I was like, he's not, you can look to all of the reporting that [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2038.88s)]
*  came up afterwards. And before I interviewed him, that he is not a, he's not a Huthy, that he is a [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2043.44s)]
*  regular Yemeni citizen. And I said like, his name is Rashad al-Haddad. He is not even a Shia. And the [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2050.16s)]
*  dude, luckily again, Iraqi went, Oh yeah, that's right. That's a Sunni last name. Al-Haddad is a [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2055.2799999999997s)]
*  Sunni last name. So he must not have been a Huthy. And the very fact that that was like a point of [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2061.6s)]
*  contention that could have fucking gotten me arrested is insane. And I genuinely in that moment [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2069.2799999999997s)]
*  was thinking like these fucking dumb ass slop tubers are actually playing with fucking fire. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2075.36s)]
*  And I even thought about not even mentioning this because I was like, I don't want to give them any, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2081.92s)]
*  any sort of like power over the situation, but like the reality of the matter is 100% the Trump [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2086.88s)]
*  administration is inadvertently working with a lot of these fucking dipshits. These, these dipshits [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2094.1600000000003s)]
*  are playing a formative role in getting people in trouble with the law. Okay. That is literally [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2100.72s)]
*  the case. It was shocking that that was the case, but it is the case. And it's actually very [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2108.9599999999996s)]
*  frustrating that it is the case that this administration doesn't care. That's why they [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2114.64s)]
*  work with Baitar. That's why they work with all these other fucking insane groups. The, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2118.0s)]
*  the Barry Weisses of the world actually have motion in this goddamn admin. Okay. So [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2122.9599999999996s)]
*  so they're cheering. They're cheering this on over at East sub. Yeah, I know. I know they can suck [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2128.0s)]
*  my dick liberals, by the way, cheering on a, a, one of the, one of the largest progressive voices [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2135.84s)]
*  in the country getting detained by the fucking Trump Gestapo. Like what a, what a wonderful, [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2143.44s)]
*  what a wonderful progressive, what a wonderful progressive audience they have over there. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2148.72s)]
*  Anyway, they're fucking straight up fascist at this point. So my point is it's crazy that like, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2154.56s)]
*  these were, these were actual questions. Like they asked me about my Twitch bands. Okay. And I talked [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2161.2s)]
*  about blowback. I talked about how, you know, I said America deserved nine 11 and it was [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2167.36s)]
*  misconstrued. You know, I do have sometimes I use hyperbolic language and it gets taken out of [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2172.08s)]
*  context or whatever. And he agreed with the blowback sentiment in terms of like the nine 11 stuff. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2178.0s)]
*  You're dumb. Yeah. No, I told him that I was like, yeah, they asked me about my fucking Twitch bands [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2184.0s)]
*  chat. It's not even a joke. They asked me about fucking Twitch chat, like Twitch bands, not Twitch [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2189.68s)]
*  chat, but Twitch bands. The other Twitch band he asked me about was the last one that I got banned. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2196.8s)]
*  And I explained to him, like, I explained to him, like, this is a man, you really talk way too much. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2202.56s)]
*  I'm supposed to say, I want a lawyer. I don't want to talk to you, but this nothing I'm doing is illegal. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2209.44s)]
*  And I also wanted to see what would happen. Do you understand? I wanted to see what would happen. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2221.76s)]
*  I wanted to actually see this experience, which is why instead of immediately fucking lawyering up, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2228.96s)]
*  I was like, no, I'm going to, I'm going to entertain this. I'm going to see what they actually are [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2234.2400000000002s)]
*  trying to get out of this. And I'm glad I did this because the reality of the mainly fucking [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2238.56s)]
*  privileged. Okay. Remember I'm a public person and also I have enough money to be able to fight back [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2243.2s)]
*  against this sort of thing. And they know who the fuck I am. So obviously the reason for why they're [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2249.84s)]
*  doing that is I think to try to create an environment of fear to try to get people like myself, [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2255.12s)]
*  or at least like others that would be in my shoes that don't have that same level of security to [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2263.84s)]
*  shut the fuck up. And for me, I'm going to use the privilege that I have in that moment to try and [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2269.2000000000003s)]
*  see what the fuck they're doing. Okay. Because every single thing that they asked me trying to [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2275.28s)]
*  get me to say something like, Oh, I support Hamas or whatever is literally not allowed. Like they [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2281.0400000000004s)]
*  are not, what the fuck do you mean? Like, why is this denying me entry into the country of my birth? [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2285.84s)]
*  Like this is my birthright. This is, I'm an American citizen. You can't just stop me at [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2292.56s)]
*  the fucking border and be like, what's your opinion on Donald Trump? You're not allowed to [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2296.88s)]
*  enter the nation. Like that's fucking bullshit. So that was the first half. Like I said, they asked [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2300.48s)]
*  about the Twitch bands. They asked about like the Rick Scott statement. And I was like, listen, [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2305.68s)]
*  I, you know, I don't, I laugh. I was like, I'm not calling for the assassination of a sitting [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2312.96s)]
*  center. That'd be fucking insane. But instead I explained to him, like I was talking about the [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2318.4s)]
*  hypocrisy of the Republicans, blah, blah, blah. I explained away all that shit and he was understanding. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2322.88s)]
*  Then he went back and he came back and the actionable items that came up afterwards [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2328.1600000000003s)]
*  was basically asking me about if I had ever been in contact with Hamas, if I'd ever been in contact [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2333.2000000000003s)]
*  with the Houthis directly or indirectly, if I'd ever actually been in contact with Hezbollah, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2340.2400000000002s)]
*  if I'd actually ever offered financial support or logistics or any kind of support to Hamas, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2345.84s)]
*  Hezbollah or Houthis. They straight up asked me that. I laughed. I said, no, of course not. But, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2351.76s)]
*  but yeah, that was once again, these are questions that they're asking. But one thing that I thought [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2358.48s)]
*  was really interesting was in the actionable side of things, they also asked, have you ever [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2364.2400000000002s)]
*  interviewed a member of Hamas? Have you ever had a communication or correspondence with a member of [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2371.44s)]
*  Hamas, Hezbollah or the Houthis? Now, what's really fucking insane about that is that as someone who [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2376.48s)]
*  works in media, sometimes I do actually do journalism, right? As I've maintained this [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2384.32s)]
*  position over and over again. And I said that I would, I would have given the opportunity to talk [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2389.2000000000003s)]
*  to someone that is a part of the Ansarullah movement, a Houthi or even Hamas or even Hezbollah, [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2394.2400000000002s)]
*  right? I think that I have the right to do so. And what was interesting, you don't do journalism, [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2400.08s)]
*  you grift. I know, Chaddard, that's why the fucking federal government is trying to arrest me. Yes, [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2406.48s)]
*  because I'm grifting too hard. That's what it is. Thank you. Yes, you're, you're fucking dumbass, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2411.7599999999998s)]
*  slop tuber is correct. I'm, I'm grifting. So, so what's interesting, asking that is a violation of [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2419.04s)]
*  prior restraint. So that part, like those are, those are the questions that are like actionable, [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2425.36s)]
*  right? Like those are the, how do you even classify a member of Hamas? It's not like even [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2430.7200000000003s)]
*  Hamas issues passports. Yeah, it's, it's fucking, it's ridiculous, right? But that is the part where [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2434.1600000000003s)]
*  they were like, if you answer yes to any of that, that's when, you know, there's like actually [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2441.28s)]
*  illegal stuff in there. Having said that, there is one part of it that wasn't illegal, which is [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2445.28s)]
*  being in communications or being in contact with someone in Hamas. Like that is a part of journalism, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2450.0s)]
*  you actually can do. It's fucking ridiculous. Like you can interview ISIS. Like what are we [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2456.48s)]
*  talking about? The notion that this would be an issue for the Customs and Border Patrol is [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2461.52s)]
*  fucking ridiculous. Okay. I mean, Donald Trump is in contact with Hamas. He had a fucking envoy [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2465.76s)]
*  directly talk to Hamas a couple months prior. He's in direct contact with the fucking Houthis. Like [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2472.48s)]
*  what are you talking about? And so is drop site. Like the idea that this was the idea that this [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2477.44s)]
*  will deny you entry into the country is fucking bullshit. Like what are we talking about? What [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2483.44s)]
*  do you, what do you mean? Like what kind of insane double standard is there? Right. And so that part [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2487.92s)]
*  was a, that part was frustrating. And the interview, the interview interrogation, whatever you want to [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2494.8s)]
*  call it. They basically, that basically ended with me asking like, so what is the purpose of this? [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2500.32s)]
*  Like, am I being detained? And cause I, cause I was like, you, you know that I'm going to talk about [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2508.8s)]
*  this. I was like, a lot of people have talked about this, like detainment structure. And he was like, [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2514.0800000000004s)]
*  yeah, people really exaggerate. The people really exaggerate how these things go. And I was like, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2518.88s)]
*  well, it is, it is not a great situation to be in, you know, like, what do you mean? And, and yeah, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2525.84s)]
*  he was like, yeah, there's been a lot of reporting on, you know, the conditions and situations like [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2533.92s)]
*  this and detainment that, but you're not technically detained. I was like, so I can leave. Like I was [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2538.88s)]
*  like, I asked him, like, I was like, am I detained? And he's like, no, it was like, all right. So what's [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2544.0s)]
*  the purpose of this entire situation? I can just walk out right now. And basically when I said that, [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2548.96s)]
*  when I said that the interview ended. So I don't know if that was something that I should have said [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2554.9599999999996s)]
*  from the start. Am I being detained? You know, what's the deal here? But, but basically, yeah, [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2560.4799999999996s)]
*  it was a illegal, it was a illegal pretense. Like, well, that's your fourth amendment, right? No, [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2568.56s)]
*  you don't have, okay. Chatters. I need you to understand something. I need you to understand [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2574.08s)]
*  something. So after I said, am I being detained or whatever, he was like, no, well, you know, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2580.16s)]
*  we're, he didn't like abruptly end it. He, he kept asking some questions, but it pretty much ended [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2584.3999999999996s)]
*  after that. And I don't know if that was like, I don't know if that's like, the, the, I got lucky [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2591.2799999999997s)]
*  there. Cause when I asked, like, am I free to have, that kind of stopped the, the process a little bit. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2597.44s)]
*  And, and I don't know if that's the reason why I didn't have them look through my phone. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2605.2799999999997s)]
*  But I wasn't planning on letting them look through my phone. Anyway, that was my point. Like there [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2610.16s)]
*  was a line where I was going to say, I'm done. I'm done with this either fucking arrest me or, [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2614.0s)]
*  you know, let me go. I don't know what the fuck's happening here. And I got detained. I didn't get [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2619.92s)]
*  detained. Yes. Chatter. Yes. Ice agents took me to a detention center. That is a defacto detention. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2624.3199999999997s)]
*  Like, what are you talking about? The total runtime of it was like two hours. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2634.7999999999997s)]
*  Which was a definitely faster than I thought it was going to be. I will admit. And I probably [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2640.3999999999996s)]
*  should have asked the, am I being detained from the start? And I wonder what it would have, [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2647.04s)]
*  I wonder what would have happened. But I basically asked him, like, do you think this is going to [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2653.2799999999997s)]
*  happen again? Right? I was like, is this going to happen again? Hold on. I, I asked like, you know, [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2657.04s)]
*  am I going to be, am I going to be detained in the future? And he said, maybe. And he gave me this [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2663.04s)]
*  piece of paper, this sheet from Homeland security. What is DSA D S D H S trip. Okay. And you can, [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2672.32s)]
*  I guess, submit an inquiry at DHS dot DHS dot gov slash trip and ask why I was stopped. There will [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2681.92s)]
*  you be prompted to describe your particular concerns and experience, provide contact information [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2694.48s)]
*  to which a response will be directed and be assigned a case number to help you monitor [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2698.56s)]
*  progress of your inquiry, which I will do. Okay. I will do this. And he basically said, [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2701.6000000000004s)]
*  you know, you can figure out what not to do so that this doesn't happen again. And I suspect [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2708.08s)]
*  the, what not to do is just don't be a political commentator that speaks about American foreign [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2713.68s)]
*  policy, which is not something I'm planning on stopping. Now, why did I tell you guys about this [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2719.2000000000003s)]
*  experience? Okay. Why did I tell you about this entire experience? Like, cause I, in my mind, [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2724.0s)]
*  I thought maybe I shouldn't reveal this stuff because I think like the goal here is to put fear [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2729.12s)]
*  into people's hearts, to, to have a chilling effect on speech that like the government is [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2735.04s)]
*  unafraid of intimidating you in illegal ways. Okay. The government is now officially willing [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2741.6s)]
*  and able to intimidate you for speech, for your speech. That is a direct violation of the first [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2748.8s)]
*  amendment. I'm an auditor. I'm no big city libertarian. I'm no Mr. Admir, Admiral maritime [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2755.04s)]
*  law. But the reality of the matter is that as of this administration, they are totally willing [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2760.96s)]
*  and able to actually come after you for your speech. And even with like ridiculous shit, [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2769.04s)]
*  like they're willing and able to go along with like stuff that gets written in the free press [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2776.56s)]
*  or willing and able to go along with shit that even fucking redditors bring up. Okay. That's how [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2780.7200000000003s)]
*  stupid and silly this situation has gotten. Now, of course, does this stop me from saying [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2785.84s)]
*  whatever the fuck I want to say? Of course not. Don't be ridiculous. But the reason why I wanted [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2792.1600000000003s)]
*  to talk about it was to, to, to, to give you more insight into what the government is doing and to [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2796.6400000000003s)]
*  speak out against this sort of stuff, because I do have a position of privilege here. And I want to [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2804.2400000000002s)]
*  make sure that like, if they can do this to me, like they probably are willing and able to do this [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2808.08s)]
*  to others as well, but you should know your rights that you should not be fearful. And you should not [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2813.28s)]
*  worry, especially if you're an American citizen, that these guys are going to come after you and [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2818.96s)]
*  like arrest you or some shit. Okay. Was your interview recorded? I don't know, but it is [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2822.7200000000003s)]
*  pretty wild. I will say as someone who's been held up in airports many times over, many times over, [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2828.2400000000002s)]
*  it was actually shocking. It was actually shocking that these guys, like these guys totally fucking [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiydsuXnbfA&t=2836.8s)]
