# Is Aviation Safety At Risk? | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI)
*  I totally understand why people look at this and go like, this is a bad omen. Sometimes [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=0.0s)]
*  there's just a, an accident that takes played plays where it's just obviously there's not [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=3.7800000000000002s)]
*  enough information at this point to explain exactly what's going on. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=8.74s)]
*  Yeah. It's like the, it's like the story in Japan about the 70 year old truck driver that [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=14.58s)]
*  fell into the sinkhole because the sinkhole opened up as the truck was making a left turn [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=19.06s)]
*  at the intersection. All right, let's get to the real news now. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=25.46s)]
*  Crash, a medical transport jet carrying six people crashing into a busy neighborhood, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=33.26s)]
*  exploding into a fireball overnight here right now is a live look over the area where you [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=39.78s)]
*  can see that massive debris field. This is thanks to our station, WPVI helicopter, where [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=45.34s)]
*  you can just see that debris littered around the street where there are businesses and [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=51.3s)]
*  homes nearby. The extent of the damage is extensive. ABC Stephanie Ramos joins us live [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=55.62s)]
*  there now. Good morning to you, Stephanie. You came from DC, stopped in Philly just after [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=62.3s)]
*  we learned about this plane crash last night. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=67.97999999999999s)]
*  That's right, Janay. And in that medical jet coming down in this Northeast Philadelphia [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=72.5s)]
*  neighborhood like a lawn dart, no one on board survived and several people on the ground [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=76.92s)]
*  were injured. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=82.56s)]
*  That's a whole plane right there burning off. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=83.56s)]
*  Overnight, a massive inferno in Northeast Philadelphia after a medical transport jet [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=87.84s)]
*  crashed into a residential neighborhood. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=92.6s)]
*  Plane just crashed into the plaza. I just saw a plane basically just hit the buildings [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=94.56s)]
*  and just an explosion happened and I just seen the sky light up. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=98.72s)]
*  In surveillance video capturing the moment it happened, you can see an explosive fireball [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=102.44s)]
*  in the night sky before the jet plummeted to the ground. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=107.52s)]
*  All black smoke covering everything. The houses ended up catching on fire down there and there [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=119.52s)]
*  was plane pieces everywhere. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=123.88s)]
*  The small plane, a jet rescue air ambulance carrying a pediatric patient, her mother, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=125.52s)]
*  and four crew members, according to the company. The child had just received care from a children's [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=131.44s)]
*  hospital in Philadelphia. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=136.84s)]
*  All six on board heading back to their home country of Mexico with a stop in Springfield, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=138.84s)]
*  Missouri. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=143.96s)]
*  The jet taking off from Northeast Philadelphia airport shortly after 6 p.m. crashing just [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=144.96s)]
*  moments later. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=150.12s)]
*  Dramatic images capturing the fiery aftermath of the crash. A massive blaze in the streets. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=152.04s)]
*  Buildings and vehicles engulfed in flames. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=157.72s)]
*  Police, responders and emergency vehicles rushing to the scene. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=160.26s)]
*  The plane crashes a few feet away from where I'm standing narrowly. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=163.66s)]
*  Only missing this strip mall right here. You can see police vehicles set up all around [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=167.17999999999998s)]
*  this area. They've set up a massive perimeter stretching blocks in each direction. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=172.34s)]
*  Stanley James III was in the parking lot. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=176.66s)]
*  As we're looking around, like literally the whole parking lot is shaking. It was like [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=179.01999999999998s)]
*  a train wreckage, like maybe like a real loud bad car accident almost or something. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=183.62s)]
*  The cause of the crash is still unclear. The NTSB is down leading the investigation. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=189.22s)]
*  Members of the FAA also arriving on the scene overnight along with Governor Josh Shapiro. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=194.62s)]
*  Tonight we also saw the best of Philly. We saw a neighbor helping neighbor. We saw Pennsylvanians [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=199.94s)]
*  looking out for one another. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=207.08s)]
*  And guys, this area is a densely populated residential neighborhood packed with row homes. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=210.06s)]
*  Many of them caught fire. Residents right now are being urged to stay out of this area [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=217.5s)]
*  for now. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=221.78s)]
*  Gio. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=222.78s)]
*  Just unbelievable to have two major crashes back to back like this just days apart. Stephanie, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=223.78s)]
*  thank you for your overnight reporting. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=230.68s)]
*  I genuinely don't know what to say about this story. Like I totally understand why people [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=235.02s)]
*  look at this and go like this is a bad omen. Sometimes there's just an accident that takes [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=239.22s)]
*  where it's just obviously there's not enough information at this point to explain exactly [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=244.46s)]
*  what's going on. Yeah. It's like the it's like the story in Japan about the 70 year [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=251.06s)]
*  old truck driver that fell into the sinkhole because the sinkhole opened up as the truck [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=256.06s)]
*  was making a left turn at the intersection. You know what I mean? Like how do I, what [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=260.54s)]
*  do I say about it? What can I say about this? This is just like a thing that happened and [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=266.54s)]
*  I have no idea how and especially with its closeness to the other, the previous insane [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=270.62s)]
*  freak accident, like it was crazy. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=277.3s)]
*  A single swallow the truck driver in Japan is expanding and the residents are worried. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=281.54s)]
*  Yeah. In Saitama about 18 miles, Northern Japan's capital opened up swallowing three [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=285.5s)]
*  ton truck and his driver, a 74 year old man prompting a rescue mission. Now in its fourth [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=290.26s)]
*  day, the inside is gouging and is getting bigger every day. The official from Saitama [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=294.74s)]
*  prefecture, sewage works division said, dude, I don't understand how sinkholes work at all. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=298.94s)]
*  Like that's definitely a thing that weirds me out. There's a thousand of these sorts [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=304.17999999999995s)]
*  of crashes a year from what I understand that don't normally get as much coverage. So I [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=308.41999999999996s)]
*  wonder if this is a result of his proximity. No, this is no, no, no. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=311.02s)]
*  There are small plane crashes and incidents such as this one that take place, but usually [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=317.5s)]
*  it's not a fiery inferno. Okay. And it doesn't crash directly into the middle of a populated [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=323.38s)]
*  area. Okay. Seven people died and the plane directly slammed into the middle of the, the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=330.5s)]
*  plane slammed into the middle of a crowded neighborhood. Here's the impact crater it [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=339.38s)]
*  created. It's an air ambulance that's unique. And it's an air ambulance that crashed on [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=344.7s)]
*  top of a crowded Philadelphia neighborhood. So a little bit about the flight itself. The [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=353.22s)]
*  flight departed originated at Opel Oco, Florida yesterday afternoon, about 12 PM. The aircraft [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=358.90000000000003s)]
*  arrived at Northeast Philadelphia airport around two 15 PM in the afternoon. It was [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=365.42s)]
*  on the ground for a few hours and departed runway two four at about seven. It was like [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=371.78000000000003s)]
*  we said, it was dark at the time and instrument conditions. The aircraft climbed to about [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=377.94s)]
*  1500 feet above the ground. We were looking at a GPS data on the aircraft, a slight right [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=383.09999999999997s)]
*  turn followed by a slight left turn and then a steep descent towards the ground where it [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=390.02s)]
*  crashed. The entire flight lasted less than a minute. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=394.21999999999997s)]
*  This morning, salvage ships preparing to expand their work on the Potomac river in Washington [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=402.74s)]
*  with barges en route to begin what officials called the main lifting. I believe for us [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=407.38s)]
*  to recover the rest of the remains that we are going to need to get the fuselage out [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=412.21999999999997s)]
*  of the water. At least 41 of the 67 victims have now been recovered from the wreckage [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=416.82s)]
*  of the Army Blackhawk helicopter and American Airlines regional plane that collided Wednesday [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=422.3s)]
*  night. Investigators also say the black boxes from both. I mean, dude, the plane was on [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=427.14s)]
*  dived then not this one. The previous plane accident. Like I can't, I don't think that's, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=432.78s)]
*  I don't think you can say D or even air traffic control for that one. You know, aircraft are [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=440.29999999999995s)]
*  now at the NTSB lab after they were recovered from two distinct debris fields in the river. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=446.9s)]
*  And we have a high level of confidence that we will be able to get a full download in [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=452.29999999999995s)]
*  the very near future. Meanwhile, new video, which first aired on CNN offers a clearer [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=457.78s)]
*  view of the mid air crash as President Trump again said the army chopper was flying too [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=462.5s)]
*  high. The black rock was too high. It was above the 200 livid by double. Shouldn't have [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=467.38s)]
*  been there. Investigative sources tell NBC News the helicopter may have been flying at [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=473.85999999999996s)]
*  350 to 400 ft when it crashed into the plane and the tower typically has one controller [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=478.61999999999995s)]
*  focusing on planes and a second on helicopters. But Wednesday night, only one person was overseeing [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=484.24s)]
*  both at the time of the collision after a supervisor allowed one controller to leave [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=489.6s)]
*  early, although that is allowed by FAA guidelines on any given day, some 100 helicopters fly [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=493.88s)]
*  near Reagan National Airport, many of the military flights, the AP uncovering scores [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=500.06s)]
*  of reports of near misses and warnings in DC airspace over the last two decades. The [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=505.0s)]
*  day before the crash, another regional jet aborted its landing after receiving a cockpit [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=510.24s)]
*  warning of helicopter traffic. 45 14 was a reason for the go around. We had an R. A. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=514.72s)]
*  With the helicopter traffic below us. Okay, 45 14. Meanwhile, the FAA announcing on Friday, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=520.36s)]
*  it's restricting helicopter traffic around the airport to all but emergency responders [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=525.86s)]
*  clearing the air while investigators work below. Our job is to just come out with a [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=530.6800000000001s)]
*  probable cause, but then more importantly, make recommendations so that this type of [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=536.16s)]
*  tragedy never occurs again. The NTSB also confirmed that controller interviews are underway [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=542.28s)]
*  as they really ramp up their fact finding work here. We also know that yesterday the [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=550.28s)]
*  NTSB gave a second briefing to more than 100 victim family members who are now in the area. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=554.52s)]
*  Laura, parts go out to them. Of course, Aaron, thank you. Hey, thanks for watching. Don't [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=559.88s)]
*  miss the today show every weekday at 11am Eastern. Finally getting woke out of media. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=565.76s)]
*  Oh yeah, I saw this, but the chance of it crashing in the road and not a building or [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=571.76s)]
*  something or almost zero percent is such a densely populated neighborhood, right? It's [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=576.28s)]
*  not. And I mean, it's definitely not 0%. But that also leads me to at least speculate that [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=580.4399999999999s)]
*  he might've directed it deliberately into like a street or something like as in to avoid [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=587.6s)]
*  further casualties. Does that make sense? Like there is a possibility it's not. I don't [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=593.96s)]
*  think it's like super. I don't know enough. I'll be honest with you. I don't, I don't [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=599.76s)]
*  know enough to tell you with 100% certainty whether or not he deliberately maneuvered [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=605.0400000000001s)]
*  the plane in Philadelphia directly onto the road in an effort to avoid the houses. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=610.64s)]
*  But did you watch the songbucket head plans or tick tock? No, can someone send any people [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=616.64s)]
*  have sent me this Lolo sent it to me this morning too. I haven't, I've only seen the [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=620.32s)]
*  thumbnail. Can someone link it in the chat? Is this it? Making a Hassan piker head planter. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLZrMZ_jMI&t=625.12s)]
