*  and even though [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=283.84s)]
*  one of the things I absolutely hate is when people in the chat say subtitles [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=284.8s)]
*  are there subtitles [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=288.24s)]

*  could deny people health insurance that they wanted to like pay for due to pre-existing [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=596.24s)]
*  conditions now this was such a uniquely cruel aspect of American for-profit health insurance [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=603.36s)]
*  that virtually every single Republican that is still in action aggressively railed against [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=611.6s)]

*  it is such an unimaginable cruelty that most Americans even new Republicans probably don't [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=629.44s)]
*  remember a time where pre-obamacare people used to literally have to fight tooth and nail [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=635.92s)]
*  it's a very interesting process it's a very interesting process because it's out there for [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=643.5999999999999s)]
*  those who seek it out you can go and find the very same Republicans that are still in action and the [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=650.24s)]
*  very same Republican content creators that are still in operation openly say this is socialism [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=655.12s)]
*  this is barbaric this is violent to force private enterprise to cover people with [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=662.4s)]
*  pre-existing conditions are unacceptable just remember that they lied about it they said [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=668.72s)]
*  they're gonna do panels with Obamacare they're gonna kill the old I applied for health care [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=674.48s)]
*  through Blue Cross Blue Shield and they told me that my body mass index was too high from five one [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=682.64s)]
*  I weigh 175 pounds I always thought the health insurance companies were there to help us [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=689.12s)]
*  so I posted a note on the internet asking people if they had had any similar stories about problems [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=697.52s)]
*  with their insurance company within 24 hours I had over 3,700 responses and by the end of the week [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=703.52s)]
*  over 25,000 people had sent me their health care horror stories sometimes when you hear a logical [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=711.44s)]
*  argument that Republicans make or logical sounding argument you mustn't fall victim [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=717.6s)]
*  to the alluring nature because at the time Republicans would say this is akin to ensuring [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=722.88s)]
*  a house while it's on fire okay logically it makes sense I'm sure if destiny was alive back [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=728.72s)]
*  then as a political commentator and instead of like I don't know what he was doing making [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=734.96s)]
*  eight-year-olds show their dicks on camera or some shit he probably would have made the same [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=739.52s)]
*  argument as well he would have been like arm actually how dare you force insurance providers [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=744.0s)]
*  to cover pre-existing conditions it's like forcing it's like asking for home insurance [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=749.1999999999999s)]
*  while your house is on fire remember just because something logically makes sense [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=754.4799999999999s)]
*  immediately in that in that when you first hear that argument doesn't mean that it's actually [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=759.36s)]
*  sound okay is that a real argument he made no I'm just saying that he has this nature about him [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=764.64s)]
*  where he must always defend for-profit capital capital corporations and defend the pre-existing [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=769.52s)]
*  status quo and those who are predisposed with defending the pre-existing status quo can [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=776.96s)]
*  sometimes make decent arguments that still doesn't matter because it's still operating [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=781.12s)]
*  off of a faulty premise but it still also doesn't matter because just because something on its face [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=785.84s)]
*  comes across as like logically sound it doesn't mean it's moral it doesn't mean it's righteous [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=791.84s)]
*  it doesn't mean it's just I'm saying that if you're I'm saying that if your goal is to defend [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=796.32s)]
*  the status quo you can make plenty of decent sounding arguments some of them decided not [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=801.0400000000001s)]

*  If you do not believe that people have the capacity to reform and actually fight against [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2115.68s)]

*  Oh, please. Some of you are more predisposed not with justice, but with vengeance. This is the most [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2179.12s)]
*  American mindset. You cannot have this mentality. If you want to be truly a progressive person, [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2188.24s)]
*  an empathetic person, a person who wants to make change, a person who cares about solidarity, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2195.92s)]
*  a person who cares about instilling class consciousness in others. Okay, you must always [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2201.6s)]
*  remember that just like you everyone is on their own personal journey. The system is designed to [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2208.16s)]
*  churn out results not like hers here, but results such as what she did in the past leading up to [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2214.24s)]
*  this moment. That's the reason why so many people there are still plenty of people who look to [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2220.72s)]
*  Brian Thompson as a fantastic individual as someone who gave back to their community. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2226.9599999999996s)]
*  Please. Yeah, use a bunch more big words that will convince us all. I'll use little words. Okay. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2233.04s)]
*  Every person has done something horrifying at a certain point in their lives. Okay. Or every person [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2239.04s)]
*  has in certain instances been rude or ruthless or bullied someone. Should we should we just keep you [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2245.92s)]
*  to that standard? Stop being a fucking dickhead and understand that people have the capacity to [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2254.64s)]
*  change and celebrate those who do also fuck you here. Take a permaban. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2259.6s)]
*  There you go. You get no rehabilitation. How about that? Get a little bit of your own fucking [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2268.08s)]
*  medicine. Thousands of pieces of paper on which I have written that deadly word to nod. Thank you. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2272.4s)]
*  How did we get to the point that doctors at health insurance companies actually being responsible [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2279.36s)]
*  for the deaths of patients who invented this system? How did this all begin? Where did the [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2285.36s)]
*  HMO start? Thanks to the wonders of magnetic tape, we know. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2290.88s)]
*  This is a private enterprise one. And the reason that he can, the reason he can do it, I had a [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2320.88s)]
*  professor come in and talk to me about this and I want to do it someday. All the incentives are [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2330.32s)]
*  toward less medical care because the less care they give them, the longer they go the right way. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2336.32s)]
*  I am proposing today a new national health strategy. The purpose of this program is simply [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2342.7200000000003s)]
*  this. I want America to have the finest health care in the world and I want every American [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2348.16s)]
*  to be able to have that care when he needs it. The plan hatched between Nixon and Edgar Kaiser [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2355.2799999999997s)]
*  worked. In the ensuing years, patients were given less and less care. Bigger log jams at the nearby [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2361.12s)]
*  public hospital and less quality medical care. Been here by 18 hours. What looks cramped and [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2368.56s)]
*  unsightly can also be dangerous. While the health insurance companies became wealthy, [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2375.84s)]
*  the system was broken. 37 million Americans are without protection against catastrophic illness. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2381.84s)]
*  The losers are the poor who may now postpone urgently needed health care until it's too late. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2388.1600000000003s)]
*  This went on for years until this man rode into town bringing with him his little lady. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2394.6400000000003s)]
*  Sassy. Hillary Clinton was smoking back in the day. Like I'll admit it. I fucking... [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2406.32s)]
*  Smart. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2416.88s)]
*  Sexy. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2420.96s)]
*  Some men couldn't handle it. Today I am announcing the formation [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2423.1200000000003s)]
*  of the president's task force on national health reform chaired by the first lady, [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2427.6800000000003s)]
*  Hillary Rodham Clinton. Hillary Rodham Clinton decided to make health care for everyone [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2432.88s)]
*  her top priority. Universal coverage now and will not depend upon where you work, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2438.32s)]
*  whether you work or whether you have a pre-existing condition. Health care that can never be taken away. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2444.48s)]
*  For the record, this was such a fucking massive and incredibly consequential moment for health [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2450.2400000000002s)]
*  care where a lot of people were very frustrated that the American Enterprise Institute or was it [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2456.96s)]
*  the Heritage Foundation? I always get it wrong. Actually came up with a solution called the [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2461.84s)]
*  Affordable Care Act. This solution was because they were fearful. It was still a market-based solution [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2466.1600000000003s)]
*  because they were fearful that America could wisen up and potentially advocate for socialized [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2472.6400000000003s)]
*  medicine. They did not want Medicare for all or some kind of single-player process. That would be [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2479.04s)]
*  socialism. That would be a bridge too far, which is precisely the reason why they went back to the [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2485.92s)]
*  drawing board. They basically cultivated what is known as today the Affordable Care Act. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2491.6800000000003s)]
*  I'll take it even one step further. The Affordable Care Act was first implemented at a state level [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2501.6s)]
*  by a Republican, a Republican governor of a blue state. That governor's name at the time, [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2509.28s)]
*  and he still exists, was Mitt Romney. The Affordable Care Act's originations are not only from [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2517.84s)]
*  a right-wing, a right-wing think tank as a way to try and combat as a way to say like, oh man, [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2524.88s)]
*  they're going to have, they're going to push for socialized medicine. We have to do something [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2535.68s)]
*  about that. We have to stop that. So here, here's our alternative. It was called the Affordable Care [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2540.4s)]
*  Act to maintain market-based healthcare solutions. And it was first implemented in Massachusetts, [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2545.52s)]
*  state of mass. Mass holes rise up by the, at the time, Republican governor, Mitt Romney. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2554.64s)]
*  Republicans complain Mrs. Clinton is getting a free ride because she's the president's wife. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2563.7599999999998s)]
*  It's fairly risky business, I believe, as President Clinton did to put his wife in charge of some big [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2568.0s)]
*  policy program. And while I don't share the chairman's joy at our holding hearings on a [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2573.6s)]
*  government-run healthcare system, I do share his intention to make the debate and the legislative [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2578.72s)]
*  process as exciting as possible. I'm sure you will do that, Mr. Army. We'll do the best we can. You [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2585.44s)]
*  and Dr. Kovorkian. Damn, she has swag. The Dr. Kovorkian response is crazy. I have been told about [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2592.16s)]
*  your charm and wit. And let me say the reports on your charm are overstated and the reports on [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2603.28s)]
*  your wit are understated. Thank you. Thank you very much. Dr. Kovorkian is the the fucking, [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2609.1200000000003s)]
*  the euthanizer, the OG euthanizer. She's saying you're a doctor of death. Pride of Armenia. Yeah, [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2615.6000000000004s)]
*  he aided in the assisted suicide of many. Assisted unaliving as the kids call it. Is this a safe [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2622.7200000000003s)]
*  space? Hillary used to be fine. Yeah, no, I, I agree. She drove Washington insane. Do you really [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2629.44s)]
*  want the federal government to control your health care? You won't have a choice of your own doctor. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2636.88s)]
*  Government mandates less government, more government control, more government and less control for you [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2640.64s)]
*  and your family. When your mama gets sick, she might talk to a bureaucrat instead of a doctor. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2645.52s)]
*  This is a total mess and it's about to get messier. Not this big bureaucratic, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2650.64s)]
*  socialistic plan that they have socialist takeover. Socialized man. Thank God things [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2655.12s)]
*  have changed quite a bit. Now you hear this kind of sentiment from the Democrats as well. There it is. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2660.96s)]
*  As medicine, what really amounts to a giant social experiment, [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2667.7599999999998s)]
*  socialized medicine, nothing put more fear in us than the thought of that. And the chief fear [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2672.8s)]
*  mongers against socialized medicine have always been the good doctors of the American Medical [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2678.88s)]
*  Association. This would put the government smack into your hospital, defining services, [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2685.28s)]
*  setting standards, establishing committees, calling for reports, deciding who gets in and [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2691.6s)]
*  who gets out. After all, the government has to treat everyone fair and equal. Don't you know? [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2697.6800000000003s)]
*  Take us all the way down the road to a new system of medicine for everybody. Yes, medicine for [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2702.88s)]
*  everyone. The AMA didn't want that and to drive the point home further, they held thousands of [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2709.6s)]
*  coffee clutches all over the country where they invited their neighbors to come and listen to a [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2716.4s)]
*  record made by a well- [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2722.4s)]
*  Ronald McDonald Reagan! Every fucking problem that you experience in your, in 2024, every fucking [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2724.4s)]
*  problem, it always goes back to the fucking devil. Sorry, I wanted to cut away before Michael Morris [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2741.28s)]
*  says those words. All known actor on the evils of socialized. My name is Ronald Reagan. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2749.36s)]
*  One of the traditional methods of imposing statism or socialism on a people has been by way of [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2756.4s)]
*  medicine. The doctor begins to lose freedoms. It's like telling a lie and one leads to another. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2762.32s)]
*  But doctor decides he wants to practice in one town and the government has to say to him, [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2768.8s)]
*  you can't live in that town. They already have enough doctors. You have to go someplace else. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2773.52s)]
*  All of us can see what happens once you establish the precedent that the government can determine [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2778.56s)]
*  a man's working place and his working methods and behind it will come other federal programs that [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2784.16s)]
*  will invade every area of freedom as we have known it in this country until one day we will awake to [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2790.72s)]
*  find that we have socialism. The White House said today it's time to tone down the rhetoric reacting [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2797.12s)]
*  to the burning and effigy of Hillary Rodham Clinton. The times may have changed but the scare [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2803.44s)]
*  tactics hadn't. The healthcare industry spent over a hundred million dollars to defeat Hillary's [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2808.16s)]
*  healthcare plan and they succeeded. And I want now to introduce to you the president because he [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2814.16s)]
*  loves the Easter egg roll. For the next seven years in the White House she wasn't allowed to [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2822.56s)]
*  bring it up again. A decade and a half went by and still America had no universal health plan. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2828.64s)]
*  The United States slipped to number 37 in healthcare around the world just slightly ahead of Slovenia. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2837.2799999999997s)]
*  But that's understandable because Congress was busy with other matters. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2849.3599999999997s)]
*  Mr. Speaker today I rise to offer. That was, that was 2006. Just so you understand [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2854.16s)]
*  things have gotten much worse. Offer congratulations to the confectioners at Justborn [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2860.96s)]
*  incorporated as they celebrate the 50th anniversary of one of their most recognized and celebrated [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2866.72s)]
*  products not to mention my daughter's favorite marshmallow peeps. And thus the healthcare industry [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2872.56s)]
*  went unchecked into the early 21st century. Umanna more than doubles its fourth quarter profit lifts [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2878.72s)]
*  its earnings outlook for the year as well. United Health has tripled its share price. Making obscene [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2884.72s)]
*  profits. There's a lot of really wealthy shareholders out there right now. Are they willing to [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2889.9199999999996s)]
*  actually share some of that wealth? Turning their CEOs into billionaires and skirting the law whenever [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2897.12s)]
*  they wanted. But their biggest accomplishment was buying our United States Congress. This is [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2902.8s)]
*  Washington at work. Lobbying is like so much of this is has has been like so much of this is on fire [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2908.5600000000004s)]
*  in 2006. And since then we have thrown accelerant on it. OK, because they're talking about the [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2917.2000000000003s)]
*  pervasive and negative influence of lobbying in like the 90s leading up to the early 2000s. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2925.84s)]
*  And it got so much worse, like so much unimaginably worse. OK, this is fucking pre-Citizens United chat. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2935.84s)]
*  This is before Citizens United. And they're like, man, this corporate lobbying, like if we were to [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2947.76s)]
*  go back to that time in terms of lobbying influence, in terms of money and politics, [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2955.12s)]
*  it would be celebrated as like this unimaginably socialist move. OK, understand this is pre-Citizens United. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2962.4s)]
*  Come so brazen the money is being collected. With four times as many health care lobbyists [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2973.7599999999998s)]
*  than there are members of Congress, they even managed to buy off old foes. For her silence, [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2979.04s)]
*  Hillary was rewarded and she became the second largest recipient in the Senate [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2985.92s)]
*  of health care industry contributions. We've given the entire health care system over to [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2991.52s)]
*  insurance industry. I mean, they have total control. Well, not total control. The drug companies like [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=2997.6800000000003s)]
*  to buy their members of Congress, too. Here's what it cost to buy these men and this woman, this guy, [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3004.48s)]
*  and this guy, and him too. And the biggest check was saved for last. Why did they hand out all this [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3011.52s)]
*  cash? They wanted a bill passed, a bill to help seniors with their prescriptions. Let there be no [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3021.44s)]
*  mistake about it. Republicans love their mothers and their fathers and their grandparents as much [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3029.28s)]
*  as anybody else on this hill. And we're going to take care of them in this country. Of course, [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3034.7200000000003s)]
*  it was really a bill to hand over 800 billion of our tax dollars to the drug and health insurance [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3040.48s)]
*  industry by letting the drug companies charge whatever they wanted and making the private [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3046.08s)]
*  health insurance companies the middleman. Everybody was going to get their cut and the man they [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3051.6s)]
*  appointed to get the job done was Congressman Billy Tosen. He was the right man for the job [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3057.7599999999998s)]
*  because he had a secret weapon. There's no one in this house loves their mother more than I love [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3064.7999999999997s)]
*  my mother. I challenge you on that, sir. There's nobody in this body that loves their mother anymore [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3070.08s)]
*  or any less than any one of us. I love that woman. Do you think for a second you love your moms and [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3076.0s)]
*  dads any more than we love ours? Do you think the Republicans and Democrats who will vote for you [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3080.7999999999997s)]
*  really believe that Mr. Stark? God bless you. Oh, they all love their mothers. It's just- [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3086.88s)]
*  May you and your mother burn in hell. Your mother for spawning Satan. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3094.8s)]
*  That they didn't love our mothers as much. Now I'm honored and pleased to sign [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3100.0800000000004s)]
*  this historic piece of legislation. I just want to also remind everybody in the chat that [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3106.7200000000003s)]
*  when Nancy Pelosi, for example, wishes that there was some semblance of civility, [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3112.5600000000004s)]
*  that we must return to a strong Republican party, or when Joe Biden says things of that nature, [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3118.72s)]
*  they're referencing this Republican party. How about no Republican party? How about no [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3125.92s)]
*  Democratic party? I hope that some of you that don't understand the full scope of this depravity [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3130.72s)]
*  that is American Congress, like when I get mad, when I get angry, when I yell about things, [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3139.6s)]
*  you're like, man, this is Sangai. He seems a little too angry at these statements. Like, [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3146.08s)]
*  I don't get it. Nancy Pelosi simply wants like normal, like Congress to operate in normal fashion. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3152.64s)]
*  Like that's a, that's an honorable thing to want. Or when Democrats tell you they want bipartisanship [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3158.7999999999997s)]
*  for the sake of bipartisanship, as though it is a virtue in and of itself. Remember that I know all [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3166.3199999999997s)]
*  of this and many others do as well. So they get why I'm angry, but you might not have known. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3172.72s)]
*  The Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3178.08s)]
*  What they didn't tell us was that the elderly could end up paying more for their prescriptions [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3183.4399999999996s)]
*  than they did before. Over two thirds of senior citizens could still pay over $2,000 a year. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3188.16s)]
*  And when it was all over, 14 congressional aides who worked on the bill, [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3196.64s)]
*  quit their jobs on the Hill and went to work for the healthcare industry, as did one congressman. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3201.76s)]
*  Billy Tosen left Congress to become the CEO of Pharma, the drug industry lobby, [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3212.88s)]
*  for a salary of $2 million a year. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3219.44s)]
*  Oh, it was a happy day in Washington and many Americans knew [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3224.6400000000003s)]
*  they were never going to see universal healthcare. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3229.2s)]
*  And that's why some of them decided to look elsewhere for help. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3232.9599999999996s)]
*  We're driving across the Detroit River. Back there's the Renaissance Center. You can see the [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3237.3599999999997s)]
*  Renaissance Center, General Motors headquarters, downtown Detroit, the skyline. You get a really [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3242.72s)]
*  nice view from driving over the bridge. This is Adrienne Campbell, a single mother who at [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3248.64s)]
*  the age of 22. I just did the calculations of United Health Care's market cap increased [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3255.28s)]
*  by almost 150 times. 150x since Hillary's universal healthcare plan failed in 1994. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3259.1200000000003s)]
*  Well, now you understand why we're the richest nation on earth, I think. All of that factors [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3265.6800000000003s)]
*  into that beautiful GDP baby. What are we talking about? That's how we're so wealthy, [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3270.0s)]
*  because it lines the pockets of insanely wealthy individuals. Came down with cancer. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3274.4s)]
*  I got cervical cancer and I was denied through the insurance company. They said, [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3281.44s)]
*  we're not paying for it because you're 22 and you don't have, you shouldn't be having [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3286.4s)]
*  cervical cancer. You're too young. Forced into debt, but now cancer-free, [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3290.96s)]
*  Adrienne was fed up with the American healthcare system. She had a new plan. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3297.36s)]
*  I have everything ready before I even hit the border. I got my passports ready. I got my money [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3302.72s)]
*  out for the $3.25 to get across one way. And I got everything just sitting up here on my [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3308.08s)]

*  across the border, Adrienne becomes a Canadian. How long have you been living here? Three months? [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3331.84s)]
*  Couple. But I haven't applied for the OHIP card yet. Okay. Because I still have mine. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3346.7200000000003s)]

*  law partner. I don't like to lie and I don't like liars. It's a little white lies, but it's, [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3365.1200000000003s)]
*  you know, I'm saving the money. You don't have to bring your checkbook when you go to the hospital [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3371.92s)]
*  here. It's provided to us. Something you don't have to worry about. You don't have to go out of your [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3376.96s)]

*  fucking annex your asses. And we're going to give you that sweet freedom of for-profit healthcare, [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3394.16s)]
*  whether you like it or not. We're not going to wait until every fucking locality, every province [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3400.56s)]
*  arrives at that beautiful conclusion that free market capitalism must thrive in Canada, [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3407.52s)]
*  whether you want it or not. We're not going to wait until each individual, until each individual [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3411.3599999999997s)]
*  state decides on their own voluntarily. It's going to be the 51st day, baby. We're coming. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3418.4s)]

*  Now I know Canada's moving towards privatization, but it's not moving fast enough. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3431.92s)]
*  They're calling the cops. The presence of our camera crew had alerted the clinic that [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3437.04s)]
*  something was up and I don't think I'm going to get seen now. So I have another idea. I'm going [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3441.2000000000003s)]
*  to go down to the other clinic. There's a clinic down the one that we passed. The police showed up [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3446.0s)]
*  over there. Yes, what Adrienne was doing was illegal, but we're Americans. We go into other [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3452.64s)]
*  countries when we need to. It's tricky, but it's allowed. It's kind of frustrating having, you know, [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3459.76s)]
*  I mean, you know, I just get married and I'd solve everything. It should be covered automatically. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3465.84s)]
*  Americans marrying Canadians just for the health care. Being used. Sounds like a good idea. See if [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3470.48s)]
*  it works. Start something, start a trend. In Canada, they give everybody free health care. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3476.88s)]
*  Doesn't it work up there? Well, no, unfortunately it doesn't. You wait months to get treatment. You [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3482.32s)]
*  can get it in a week or a few days here. In Canada. It's so funny because people still say this shit, [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3486.8s)]
*  like, as though you can't, you know, as though you can't find out, like you can't investigate [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3492.64s)]
*  and find out Canada wait times literally mirror American wait times. Okay. It's such a funny lie [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3497.52s)]
*  that people say all the time. It's you hear the arguments from liberals and Republicans alike [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3505.44s)]
*  that want to maintain the current, the, the current oligarchy. He'd have to wait nine to [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3511.68s)]
*  10 months for bypass surgery. Many Canadians believe it's the healthcare system itself. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3517.7599999999998s)]
*  That's truly sick. They pay their doctors less. Surgeons can only do a certain number of operations [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3523.92s)]
*  each year with only so many expensive new pieces of equipment. It's easier for your cat or dog [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3529.6800000000003s)]
*  to receive an MRI here in America. You die of cancer waiting for that chemo. Cause like all of [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3535.44s)]
*  Ottawa has one chemo machine. And if you think socialized medicine is a good one of the funniest [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3540.4s)]
*  parts about like this anger and resentment towards socialized medicine or like people saying like [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3545.28s)]
*  Canadian healthcare socks is that it is literally underfunded. The solution to that is to give it [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3551.44s)]
*  more money. Okay. That's it. Not only are they greatly exaggerating the, the horrifying nature [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3557.92s)]
*  of Canadian healthcare, but it's literally because like aspects of Canadian healthcare that are [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3565.36s)]
*  falling short happen exclusively because of underfunding. This is a mechanism to bring [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3571.12s)]
*  about privatization. They do this in the NHS in the UK as well. Three, two, two and a half decades, [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3577.76s)]
*  almost two decades or almost two decades of austerity led by the fucking Tories have crippled the NHS. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3584.2400000000002s)]
*  So what happens when the NHS is crippled because it's underfunded. Okay. Then you're like, we gotta [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3591.84s)]
*  do private substitutes. We gotta do private substitutes. We gotta bring in some private [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3596.88s)]
*  healthcare. Then slowly, but surely private healthcare takes over socialized medicine, [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3601.52s)]
*  national healthcare. The irony of course is the very same austerity measures [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3607.44s)]
*  that happen in socialized structures in an effort to privatize already are baked into the free market [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3613.28s)]
*  capitalism that we love here in the United States of America, because when healthcare is for profit, [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3618.48s)]
*  it is not, it doesn't exist in certain places. That's why God forbid you actually get into an [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3625.04s)]
*  injury in like a rural part of the country. In many of these rural parts of the country, [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3632.48s)]
*  when you get injured, you just don't even have a fucking hospital to go to because they closed, [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3638.4s)]
*  because it's not profitable, because there's no profit. Even though the damn near entirety of [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3644.4s)]
*  the American hospital system is also pretty much backed by voluntary contributions, [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3652.08s)]
*  and also a shit ton of local and federal subsidies. So we have the exact same problems that they do [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3658.0s)]
*  and we pay more. So I thought who better to ask than my Canadian relatives, [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3666.0s)]

*  Yeah, this is the reason why single payer is the way. Okay. Wait, brother. So you're saying [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3681.36s)]
*  mixed private and public health care options are not possible at all. It all just turns into private. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3687.44s)]
*  I always thought a mixed one would work. Guess not. No, that is that that is the problem with mixed [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3690.8s)]
*  with mixed healthcare, unless there is like severe, severe regulation surrounding it. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3696.6400000000003s)]
*  They will always, they will private healthcare will always inevitably be used as an alternative [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3703.2000000000003s)]
*  to public ones and inevitably used to cripple the public alternative. Look no further than the, [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3710.56s)]
*  look no further than schooling. Look no further than education. If you want to understand how [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3718.72s)]
*  damaging this is, there are certain countries that have tried to do that with education, [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3722.64s)]
*  like Sweden, for example, and they saw such horrifying results when they tried to venture [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3727.36s)]
*  into privatization that they were like, we can't do that. We can't do that. We're turning into [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3733.68s)]
*  Denmark. We have to stop it. In Canada. Now, what, what are you, what are you guys doing here? [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3738.64s)]
*  We're buying insurance. We're going over to the states. We're going to the states to see you. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3746.48s)]
*  Right. You know, it's just across the river. Yeah. You wouldn't even go over, see us over in Michigan [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3750.8799999999997s)]
*  for a couple of hours without this insurance? No, we wouldn't. We just, we're just adamant about it. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3756.64s)]
*  We would not do it if somebody punches us in the mouth or something and something like that. You [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3762.08s)]
*  don't want to get caught in the American health system. Yeah. We have nothing against Americans [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3767.84s)]
*  or America or anything like that at all. We're a nice and simple people. Well, not very simple, but [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3773.52s)]
*  do you know or understand that wait times for hospital emergency rooms in British Columbia, [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3781.2000000000003s)]
*  Canada is horrifyingly eight to 12 hours and even then no nurse might see you? [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3784.7200000000003s)]
*  Hmm. I wonder how that happened. I wonder how that happened chatter. No, [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3789.36s)]
*  get some private healthcare, bitch. You know what? You and your dad will love that. Okay. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3794.08s)]
*  Trust, trust. It's going to be so good when you get that. That's what I'm saying, dude. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3799.7599999999998s)]
*  America's coming for you. Okay. America is fucking coming for you, dude. It's coming. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3806.56s)]
*  I wonder if it's better in Turkey. Fuck. Yeah, it's better in Turkey. What the fuck do you mean? [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3813.84s)]
*  There's at least a fucking nationalized healthcare system in Turkey. Regardless of how fucking broke [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3817.52s)]
*  Turkey is, there's free college and free healthcare in Turkey. Yeah, it is. There's also a [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3821.84s)]
*  private structure on top of that, but at least there's still a nationalized system. If you have [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3828.1600000000003s)]
*  socialized medicine in your country and it fucking sucks dick, remember someone is deliberately [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3832.88s)]
*  refusing to fund it so that they can eventually, eventually privatize it. Nah, they might have a [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3839.92s)]
*  horrible take, but I still wouldn't wish you as healthcare system on my worst enemies. What are [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3846.1600000000003s)]
*  you talking about? What are you talking about, dude? It's called freedom. Freedom to choose. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3849.92s)]
*  Certainly very nice. I decided to explore their anti-American views further over some fine Canadian [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3857.36s)]
*  cuisine. We have a friend who went to Hawaii and he sustained a head injury while he was there. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3866.08s)]
*  And before he was well enough to come home, he had chalked up a bill of over $600,000. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3875.2000000000003s)]
*  So what middle-class Canadian could absorb that? I guess I feel bad. I fell off an e-scooter in [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3881.76s)]
*  Turkey, got on an ambulance ride to the closest public hospital, stayed there for two days, [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3888.96s)]
*  got multiple MRIs taken and have not paid a single lira. Food, bed, medicine, painkillers, [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3891.92s)]
*  everything was paid for by the government. The only thing that sucks with public healthcare [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3896.2400000000002s)]
*  is that the hospitals are not like fucking hotels in the way that American hospitals are like. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3901.44s)]
*  I can't speak to like hospitals in shittier areas in the country, but hospitals in Los Angeles, [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3907.84s)]
*  for example, they're like fucking hotels. They're still shitty because it's a hospital [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3914.48s)]
*  and there's this like fucked air about it. But yeah, it'll be gray. Your bed will be kind of shit. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3919.2000000000003s)]
*  The food won't be great, but guess what? It's fucking free. And I would much rather have that. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3927.6s)]
*  That you would have to worry about something like that. We're not criticizing your country. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3934.4s)]
*  We're just giving you the facts that we could not afford to be without insurance. Even for a day. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3939.12s)]
*  Even for a day. To prove their point even further, they sent me over to a local golf course to talk [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3946.24s)]
*  to Larry Godfrey, who had a golfing accident while on vacation in Florida. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3951.6s)]
*  I could hear a noise and feel a pain and the tendon snapped off this bone here that holds the [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3957.28s)]
*  bicep in place. So this bicep muscle was released like on an elastic and it ended up here on my chest. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3963.36s)]
*  Muscle came right up your arm and ended up right up in your chest? Ended up right here. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3970.8s)]
*  Like all good golfers, Larry finished his round before seeking medical attention. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3974.96s)]
*  That's when he got the bad news. I wasn't too worried because I had out of country insurance, [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3980.4s)]
*  but when he told me it was 23 or 24,000, then I... 24,000? Dollars, yes. So if you'd stayed in the [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3985.92s)]
*  United States, this would have cost you 24,000 dollars. 24,000 dollars, yes. Instead, you went [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3994.08s)]
*  back to Canada and Canada paid your total expenses. Everything. Paid for the operation. Yes. And it [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=3998.16s)]
*  cost you? Nothing. Zero. Zero. Zero. I'm wondering why you expect your fellow Canadians, who don't [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4003.84s)]
*  have your problem, why should they, through their tax dollars, have to pay for a problem you have? [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4011.44s)]
*  Because we would do the same for them. It's just the way it's always been and it's the way we hope [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4017.84s)]
*  it'll always be. Right, but if you just had to pay for your problem and don't pay for everybody [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4024.48s)]
*  else's problem, just take care of yourself. Well, there are lots of people who aren't in a position [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4029.76s)]
*  to be able to do that and somebody has to look after them. Are you a member like the Socialist [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4033.44s)]
*  Party here? No. No. Green Party? No. No, I, well, actually I'm a member of the Conservative Party. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4039.2s)]
*  Is that bad? Well, it's just a little confusing. Well, it shouldn't be. I think that, I think that [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4046.24s)]
*  where medical matters are concerned, it wouldn't matter in Canada. What party you... [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4052.8799999999997s)]
*  Oh, don't worry. Things have changed in Canada too, baby. You got a taste of that fucking freedom. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4056.7999999999997s)]
*  Oh, hell yeah, baby. Oh man, Canadians are getting a taste of that sweet, juicy... [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4062.0s)]
*  Freedom, freedom I carry. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4070.4s)]
*  You were affiliated with, if any. But to us, as we look across the river here, you know, why don't you [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4087.52s)]
*  think we believe that? What's wrong on this issue with us? I guess the powers that be don't share [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4094.64s)]
*  our beliefs that healthcare ought to be universal. I mean, Canadians didn't until we met up with a [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4102.24s)]
*  guy named Tommy Douglas, who pretty much changed everyone's mind. What do you say about the fact [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4110.16s)]
*  that specialists are flocking to the U S because salaries are way higher and they think contributes [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4117.12s)]
*  to why specialist wait times are longer in Canada than the U S. And to be honest, I don't know how [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4120.4s)]
*  to fix that for Canada. Or on the opposite. I don't know how to bring about single-payer [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4123.52s)]
*  healthcare with the U S without drastically reducing the salaries for specialists. Yeah, [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4127.120000000001s)]
*  no, it's going to happen. The AMA will be the final fucking step in that process, [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4131.280000000001s)]
*  but it's the same principle behind the housing market. No, that's not even true. No, it is true. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4135.68s)]
*  It is true to a certain degree. There is like American, American specialists do get paid a lot [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4140.96s)]
*  more. It's like very unique shit that America thrives on in terms of healthcare. Like they'll [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4148.16s)]
*  say, Oh, if you have like a unique type of brain cancer, America is the best at dealing with that. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4154.48s)]
*  Right. And that's it. It's ironic. Cause like America is cooking Canada in that regard as well, [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4161.68s)]
*  because it's just like, like the average pay for doctors is significantly higher here. My argument [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4166.16s)]
*  always has been that Medicare for all works alongside like socialized medicine works alongside [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4171.12s)]
*  socialized education. Because if you didn't, if you didn't get saddled with like a million dollars [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4176.32s)]
*  of debt to go to medical school, then you don't have to justify such higher salaries to begin with. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4184.32s)]
*  But of course that's again, there goes the song advocating for more socialism on top of the [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4193.04s)]
*  socialism that he's advocating for. And it's kind of funny cause like that's just how it works. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4199.44s)]
*  And on top of that, wait till I tell you about the additional incentives that must exist [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4204.08s)]
*  when there's need for more doctors, for example, a competent government is supposed to not only [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4209.76s)]
*  offer subsidies, but also incentivize people by paying them to go on an educational journey to [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4215.2s)]
*  become doctors. That's normally how it's supposed to work. And it does in other countries. That's [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4222.32s)]
*  how it works. The government understands that there is need for certain sectors. So they pay [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4228.16s)]
*  you to go and get to work in that sector. And once you get paid to get this education and you have [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4234.08s)]
*  to work in that sector, for example, in Turkey, if I'm not, I don't know if I'm fucking this up, [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4241.36s)]
*  but basically because education, because education is free, okay. All the way up the college level, [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4247.68s)]
*  even though there's private education as well. When you get that free education, you have to, [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4253.2s)]
*  you have to go get assigned to work by a lottery system in an underserved area. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4259.2s)]
*  Turkey is a shit hole. Why even mention it? Lamau. That's why all our doctors leave for USA Lamau. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4265.84s)]
*  One out of five Canadians don't have a family doctor. Loma fail makes zero sense. Turkey is [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4270.72s)]
*  a shit hole. Why even mention it? Lamau. See, that's the one chatter that's going to really [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4275.44s)]
*  love that private healthcare. You know what I mean? I can't wait. I can't wait for that [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4280.24s)]
*  private freedom to come to your fucking dumb ass country. Okay. Like Turkey is an incredibly poor [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4285.04s)]
*  country. Turkey is run by a corrupt autocrat who is insanely, I mean, he's a kleptocrat through [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4290.4s)]
*  and through. Okay. Yes. I'm a half. I'm a capitalist. Hopefully we get private healthcare. Oh God. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4296.8s)]
*  God. Yes, baby. Yes. Yes. Advocate for your own demise. You fucking peasant. It's great. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4301.92s)]
*  Milord ship. We must restore the monarchy. My hand for you. Good sir. I am a peasant. I advocate [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4311.68s)]
*  those who simply do not have the capacity in the mental fortitude to understand. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4321.4400000000005s)]
*  Milord ship is God's sand. He knows best. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4327.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. If we get private healthcare, more doctors will come to Canada. All our doctors leave [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4333.68s)]
*  because it's public. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Milord ship, you know, best. It's so funny because [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4336.72s)]
*  you're not factoring in that. Like even if more doctors come to your country in that process, [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4343.84s)]
*  your dumb ass is not going to be able to pay for it. Oh, so good. He's like, well, the doctors [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4349.360000000001s)]
*  are now bountiful and yet I cannot pay. The doctors are more bountiful and yet healthcare is [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4356.56s)]
*  now no longer given to people by need, but instead by those who can pay for it. And it seems I cannot [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4363.200000000001s)]
*  pay for it, but it's okay because at least I now know that there are more doctors in Canada. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4372.320000000001s)]
*  Also, remember how I said in socialized medical systems, this is born out of underfunding. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4380.320000000001s)]
*  I didn't say to get rid of public health care. I just said, it would be nice if we got private [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4386.32s)]
*  health care too, as more Canadians would have access to doctors. Yeah. No, totally. No, [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4389.04s)]
*  definitely. Considering that you're angry and not looking at the actual solution, which would be to [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4393.679999999999s)]

*  Also, I thought that you could get private healthcare in Canada. A lot of people who [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4406.88s)]
*  have money don't have family doctors. So even if you want to see a doctor, you don't, you can't see [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4410.639999999999s)]
*  one. I'm not angry at all. What do you mean fund that fund? What health care system? Healthcare is [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4415.68s)]
*  already funded. There it is, dude. Yeah. There's only a finite pool of money that healthcare can [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4419.200000000001s)]
*  be funded by. It can never be increased. The smartest, the smartest private healthcare enjoyer [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4424.400000000001s)]
*  in Canada. The smartest, the smartest private healthcare demander in Canada. I don't understand. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4431.04s)]
*  Healthcare is funded already. Don't you know finite? How was it finite? I'm being sarcastic, [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4437.76s)]
*  dumb ass. It's not, it's not finite. That's my point. You can put more money into the system. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4442.56s)]
*  Also, I'm pretty sure you guys already have fucking a private healthcare as a substitute as well. I [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4448.8s)]
*  don't know if you've ventured into that territory in that process. You can even pay doctors at even [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4454.72s)]
*  higher wage if necessary or hire more doctors or hire more nurses. It's ironic because as someone [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4459.200000000001s)]
*  who's in the pocket of big registered nurse, I am, I am very aware that these exact same problems [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4469.44s)]
*  exist in America as well. One of the most common things that nurses go on strike for is the very [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4477.919999999999s)]
*  fact that hospitals refuse to hire more nurses. And instead, whenever people go on strike, [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4482.5599999999995s)]
*  they'll just hire fucking nurses that travel traveling nurses instead to make up for the [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4489.759999999999s)]
*  work stoppage. They pay them a lot more than the actual nurses that are, you know, full-time [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4496.08s)]
*  salary staff too. So don't worry. The very same problems with socialized medicine that could be [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4500.24s)]

*  Oh, it's so funny because every Canadian in the chat is yelling at this, yelling at this Canadian [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4520.64s)]
*  for demanding private healthcare in Canada. And instead saying, no, just fucking put more money [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4526.4s)]

*  country can still do the same. Some provinces do have barriers to limit private practice. As of [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4559.200000000001s)]
*  2024, the median salary for a doctor in Toronto is estimated to be 143,000 per year. However, [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4563.92s)]
*  the salary range for doctors in Ontario can vary widely from 72,000 to 336,000 annually. The average [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4568.240000000001s)]

*  a lot are subscription based. That's not the same as seeing a doctor buddy. So you can get it. You [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4604.400000000001s)]
*  just don't want to get it. You just, you, you specifically want it to be a doctor and not a [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4609.44s)]

*  But now you're like, no, I actually have to have it not just be a private clinic, but I want it to [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4628.799999999999s)]
*  be a doctor as well. Would you rather get medical advice from a doctor or a nurse law? I mean, [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4632.719999999999s)]
*  I would rather get medical advice in a fucking socialized medicine structure. So that's it. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4637.76s)]
*  That's my, that's my choice. I advocate for that all the time. And seemingly while you live in this, [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4642.96s)]
*  while you live in this privilege, you still have the dumb ass opinion that it should be, [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4649.92s)]
*  it should be privatized. Yeah. I don't disagree with you. It doesn't seem like you agree with me, [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4655.12s)]
*  not fully privatized. No, I don't want, I don't want any sort of privatization. If it were up to [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4660.24s)]
*  me, it would be a national healthcare system. That's fully funded again. One out of five people [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4664.48s)]
*  don't have family doctors. Yeah. One out of every third American doesn't have fucking primary [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4668.0s)]
*  healthcare providers at all. So it doesn't fucking matter. Okay. That's a lot of people for 35 [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4674.48s)]
*  million people in this country. Yeah. Your tiny ass fucking country still gets it done. Okay. So [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4680.639999999999s)]
*  shut the fuck up. We have 330 million in the United States of America and one third don't have a [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4684.5599999999995s)]

*  because it's private. Yeah, that's fucked up. It's not public in the USA though, brother. You [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4692.4s)]
*  don't understand. And I don't need, I don't know if I can ever get this across your, your thick dome. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4695.839999999999s)]
*  Okay. That is what you can look forward to with private healthcare. You're like, oh, but there [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4701.2s)]
*  should be some semblance of like socialized medicine. And then also, also then, you know, [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4705.839999999999s)]
*  some private partnerships and private, private and public partnerships. Like that's the best path [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4711.759999999999s)]
*  forward. And I'm telling you, you let, instead of funding the current existing public structure, [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4717.36s)]
*  opening up ways for more privatization will unironically lead to your country looking a [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4724.639999999999s)]
*  lot like mine. That's the problem. I can't believe we're having this conversation over literally [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4730.16s)]
*  how devastating American healthcare is because it's fully private. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4736.4s)]
*  One guy. One guy. Yeah. One guy did it. He, uh, can he come over and visit us? He's dead, [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4741.52s)]
*  unfortunately. In fact, he was, he's just most recently been revered as Canada's [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4747.52s)]
*  singular most important person. We, we think so much of, of, I mean, in your history, [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4752.72s)]
*  in our history, your whole history, in our whole history, more than your first prime minister. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4757.76s)]
*  Absolutely. Yeah. Even more than Wayne Gretzky. No way. Absolutely. Great singer. More than Celine. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4761.360000000001s)]
*  More than Rocking Boatwinkle. Maybe. As the blade went through, it caught the glove that I was [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4769.6s)]
*  wearing and it sliced through the entire group of fingers and completely taken them off. And [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4774.56s)]
*  I realized that I needed help immediately. Well, obviously putting on amputated fingers or arms or [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4781.6s)]
*  limbs, one of the more dramatic things that we can do. If you're looking at five fingers, [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4786.88s)]
*  you're potentially looking at a 24 hour operation. So there actually was four surgeons, uh, as well [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4790.88s)]
*  as all the nurses, uh, two different anesthetists to carry out an operation of that magnitude. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4796.4s)]
*  When somebody like Brad came in, we didn't have to worry about whether or not he could afford it. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4802.08s)]
*  He needed help. He needed a great deal of help and we could just concentrate on finding the best way [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4806.879999999999s)]
*  to bring him through it. I met this American, uh, he cut off the ends of two of his fingers, uh, [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4811.5199999999995s)]
*  with a saw. So when he arrived at the hospital, they told him that, well, one figure is going to [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4817.839999999999s)]
*  cost you around $60,000. Uh, it was going to be $12,000. He had to choose which finger he could afford. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4821.6s)]
*  We've never told someone that they couldn't put a finger back on because the system wouldn't allow [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4832.08s)]
*  it. I'm very glad I work within a system that has allows me the freedom to look after people, [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4837.52s)]
*  not have to make choices like that. It seems that nothing we were told about the Canadian system was [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4843.6s)]
*  true. Maybe I was just in the wrong part of town. So I went across the city to a crowded hospital [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4849.2s)]
*  waiting room. How long did you have to wait here to get help? 20 minutes, 45 minutes. I got [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4854.88s)]
*  the help right away. You can see how crowded this is. They really do an amazing job. Did you have to [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4861.76s)]
*  get anyone's permission to come to this hospital? No, no, no, no. We can go anywhere we want. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4868.32s)]
*  You don't have to get it pre-approved? No, no, it just... By your insurance company? Oh, no. Oh, [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4874.32s)]
*  heavens no. Can you choose your own doctor? Oh, sure. Oh, yes. What's your deductible? Nothing. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4878.8s)]
*  I don't think we have any. I don't know. I don't think there's any as far as I know. So what did [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4884.400000000001s)]
*  this set you back? Nothing. We know like in America like people pay for their health care, but I guess [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4890.16s)]
*  we just don't really understand. Like we don't understand that concept because we don't have to [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4895.04s)]
*  deal with that. And we're dealing with Parkinson's, stroke, heart attack. We're very, very lucky. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4898.72s)]
*  Really we are. I mean we complain, you know, people complain about everything, right? Right, [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4904.48s)]
*  you're Canadian. But on the whole, it's a really a fabulous system for making sure that the least of [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4909.2s)]
*  us and the best of us are taken care of. It turns out that Canadians live three years longer than [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4916.16s)]
*  we do. That's not hard to believe when you meet fellow Americans like Eric. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4921.12s)]
*  Eric Turnbow of Olympia, Washington saved up his whole life so that he could visit the famed Abbey Road [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4926.16s)]
*  crosswalk in London. But it wasn't enough for Eric to just walk across the road like the Beatles did. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4937.28s)]
*  He had to do it his own special way. Here's Eric about to walk in his hands across Abbey Road. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4943.599999999999s)]
*  Hey! Oh, I got it then. Try it again. Oh no, I put my shoulder up. Are you in pain? Yeah. There's a hospital right there. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4949.12s)]
*  The British hospital didn't charge Eric anything for his stay and only about 10 bucks for all the [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4957.76s)]
*  way cool drugs they gave him. You all swung up as Elvis would say. I'm gonna be okay. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4963.68s)]
*  Yeah, this is the other point that's also important. I don't know if you mentioned this either, [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4969.68s)]
*  but the higher pay for American doctors doesn't necessarily attract the best doctors. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4972.88s)]
*  It attracts the ones that want to make the most money. Plenty of extraordinary doctors do work for [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4976.4s)]
*  doctors without borders or pro bono because they care about people not for money. I know, that's [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4980.32s)]
*  capitalism brain route that I forgot to address as well. The idea that like money is the only [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4984.5599999999995s)]
*  incentivization structure for anyone to do anything. But obviously we cannot rely on the [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4988.5599999999995s)]
*  magnanimous nature of humans. So I do understand that argument as well. Like that it needs to, [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4993.28s)]
*  there obviously still needs to be an incentive structure. But the solution to that is to once [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=4999.759999999999s)]
*  again fund the healthcare system adequately rather than crippling it starving the beast, [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5004.88s)]
*  if you will, only with the interests of sneaking in for profit healthcare institutions as a [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5009.6s)]
*  substitute. Doug Ford's plan to outsource surgeries to for profit clinics won't save [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5018.72s)]
*  Ontario's healthcare system, experts said at a public hearing on the bill. Investing in [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5023.28s)]
*  public hospitals, which communities have spent hundreds of years building is the answer they say. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5026.88s)]
*  Ontario. It will poach the staff from our public healthcare system. There's no magic [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5030.72s)]
*  puff of human resources. Shortages in hospitals will be made worse and hospitals will be left [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5037.4400000000005s)]
*  with all the complex cases as private clinics skim off the easiest patients. How does that make [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5044.240000000001s)]
*  sense? For a hundred years or more, literally hundreds of towns across Ontario have struggled [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5049.6s)]
*  to build works to build their local public hospitals. Those communities have donated. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5058.0s)]
*  American private healthcare is shitty. All right. But American pink colored vision of public [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5064.56s)]
*  healthcare is not counting on a lot of its own problems. I think there's need for both public [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5067.28s)]
*  and private man, man. Stop this nonsense. Okay. Only one kind of monopoly appears and start doing [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5070.32s)]
*  whatever they want. Yes. I would much rather have a monopoly that the government runs because [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5075.92s)]
*  ultimately that would actually impact American lives in a positive way in every facet, because [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5081.04s)]
*  once the government is actually paying for American welfare, then they have to, then they [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5085.92s)]
*  can no longer fucking make every American obese by having our dog shit food supply as well. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5090.32s)]
*  Okay. I hate euro chatters who fucking operate on this like mixed market economy attitude, [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5098.56s)]
*  not realizing that if it wasn't for the fucking socialists and the trade unions and the [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5105.76s)]
*  communists that fucking fought long and hard to ensure that there was at least like on some [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5108.96s)]
*  underlying infrastructure that you wouldn't even be able to say this kind of shit. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5113.12s)]
*  Okay. The instance of profiteering in every sector inevitably overtakes the not for profit [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5117.12s)]
*  public sector, no matter what. Okay. Democracy can only hold on for so long. You're already seeing [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5125.04s)]
*  you're already seeing the fucking damaging aspects of austerity with the sinister purpose of [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5132.48s)]
*  privatization happening all around Europe. And your right-wing politicians are literally pointing [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5138.56s)]
*  to Muslim refugees and shit and trans people in the same exact vein that we do here in the United [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5143.92s)]
*  States of America to make you not pay attention as they rob you fucking blind. If you're wondering [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5150.240000000001s)]
*  why the very same institution that you relied on that were publicly funded are no longer as good [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5156.64s)]
*  as they used to be maybe 10 years ago, that is the reason because ultimately they will cripple it. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5161.92s)]
*  They will under fund it. They will cripple it. And then when people get mad about the the lack [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5166.64s)]
*  of quality care, when people get mad about the wait times on public transit, for example, [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5172.72s)]
*  inevitably they will sell it off to a private corporation. And that private corporation might [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5177.84s)]
*  actually make it look good in the first couple of years when they're operating. But ultimately, [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5182.64s)]
*  they will make it so much worse. The UK learned that the fucking hard way with his railroads. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5187.6s)]
*  And then what do you have? You have no one. You have no accountability. You have people who are [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5193.280000000001s)]
*  not accountable to anyone operating under this idea that like, well, the free market will actually [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5198.8s)]
*  fix the problems. It's far too late at that point. Are you actually advocating for 100% public health [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5203.68s)]
*  is just not feasible? Yeah, I am. And it absolutely is feasible. The fuck are you talking about? [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5209.280000000001s)]
*  Like the NHS still exists, regardless of the conservative initiatives to [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5217.28s)]
*  destroy it. Okay. What do you mean it just is not 100% feasible? What are you talking about? [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5222.0s)]
*  Why do people have like, why do people just say these insane things? It has to be hybrid. No, [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5228.639999999999s)]
*  the fuck it doesn't. It literally does not. Anyway, it doesn't matter. Americans are never [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5233.92s)]
*  getting even fucking a hybrid structure anyway. So y'all dumbasses can fantasize like you're fucking [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5238.0s)]
*  European social democrats who are also volunteering away the the pre existing public [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5242.96s)]
*  services so that privatization can come through. Have fun. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5249.2s)]
*  You don't understand it has to be because if it isn't, then he would be wrong. Exactly. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5257.52s)]
*  I'm not even an advocate for single payer. I'm an advocate for nationalized health care. Okay. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5272.96s)]
*  That's my ultimate goal. But in the process, if we get the public option, or we get and then we [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5299.04s)]
*  move on to an expansion of Medicare, so that we have Medicare for all like I'll take it, [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5304.5599999999995s)]
*  I'll take anything at this point, please, for the love of Christ. People are fucking dying. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5309.36s)]
*  And for for the first time ever in American history, the one guy that died was a fucking [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5314.959999999999s)]
*  CEO of a private health care insurance company. Okay. There's a one time that all of that anger [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5319.919999999999s)]
*  and resentment is left someone so incredibly angry. It's eight pounds now fucking bullshit. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5326.48s)]
*  Okay, dude. What a what a problem. I would love for the US to have universal health care. But how [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5334.32s)]
*  do you grapple with the insurance industry stranglehold on medical care? I don't want to [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5338.5599999999995s)]
*  say what I think. stranglehold is right though. They're automatically exempt. So only a working [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5343.12s)]
*  adult who earns enough money pays the six pounds 65 an education for free. That's right. No money, [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5349.36s)]
*  no money being exchanged. There's no money being exchanged. And what's the purpose of the cash [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5355.36s)]
*  register? I'm just wondering, where's the where's the bread and the milk and the candy in here? [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5361.839999999999s)]
*  Okay, I can't pick up any laundry detergent here. No, I haven't been trained for that many years to [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5369.5199999999995s)]
*  be selling detergent. So no, I next went to a state run hospital operated by the National Health [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5375.28s)]
*  Service. I'm due in seven weeks, and I get six months off paid. And then I can have six months [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5383.04s)]
*  off unpaid as well. So I'm actually taking a year. That sounds like a lecture where I'm from. Oh, [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5391.04s)]
*  really? It's not like that in the US? No, not at all? No. So what do you pay for a stay here? [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5396.56s)]
*  No one pays. They're asking how do people pay? And I say, well, there isn't you don't you just [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5403.44s)]
*  National Insurance? Yeah, there's no bill at the end of it as it were. Even with insurance, [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5409.68s)]
*  there's bound to be a bill somewhere. So where's the billing department? [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5415.84s)]
*  There isn't really a billing department. What they charge you for that baby? [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5420.160000000001s)]
*  This story, you got to pay before you can get out of here, right? No, no, no, everything's on [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5425.68s)]
*  this is NHS. It's not America. Maybe I'd have better luck in the part of the hospital where [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5430.72s)]
*  things can get serious. Just you motherfuckers. Wait, it's coming. It's expensive. This guy broke [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5438.48s)]
*  his ankle. How much will this cost him? Sorry? The emergency room visit. You know, they have some [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5444.959999999999s)]
*  huge bill. Yeah, NHS everything is free. I'm asking about hospital charges. Yeah, you're laughing at [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5450.719999999999s)]
*  because I was never asked this question in emergency department. That's why I was starting to fall for [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5459.12s)]
*  this everything is free bit. And then I discovered this. So this is where people come to pay their [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5463.76s)]
*  bill when they're done staying in the hospital. Now, this is the NHS hospital. So you don't pay [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5471.2s)]
*  the bill. You get to just go home. Why does it say cashier here if people don't have to pay a bill? [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5475.68s)]
*  All we have is a little man who stands behind the counter and gives people money [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5482.56s)]
*  if they've had to pay for transport. Those who have reduced means get their travel expenses [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5486.88s)]
*  reimbursed. So in British hospitals, instead of money going into the cashiers window, [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5492.64s)]
*  money comes out. The criteria for letting you out of the hospital are not if you've paid your bill. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5498.8s)]
*  The criteria are are you fit to go and are you going somewhere safe? Clearly, I was just the [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5503.360000000001s)]
*  butt of a joke here. What I needed was a good old-fashioned American who would have some [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5508.64s)]
*  understanding. Well, I first came to London in 1992. And we just ended up staying and we had [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5515.04s)]
*  three children here. I had them all on the NHS, which is the National Health Service, [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5523.28s)]
*  the British National Health Service. I think like a lot of Americans assumed that socialized medicine [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5528.08s)]
*  was just bottom of the rung treatment that you know, that's the only possible way would be, [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5533.84s)]
*  you know, dingy and horrible. And it would be like the Soviet Union. I mean, that's kind of how [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5538.48s)]
*  I was terrible. But that's what I thought. That's what I thought too. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5542.8s)]
*  After having a baby, it's right back to the wheat fields. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5547.6s)]
*  And then it occurred to me that back home in America, we've socialized a lot of things. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5550.48s)]
*  God damn it. Things could be so fucking glorious, dude. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5574.0s)]
*  You know what I feel like when I see like old Soviet propaganda, I feel the same exact way that [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5577.04s)]
*  like the dumbest guy, you know, on Twitter feels when they watch like a 1950s American commercial [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5584.400000000001s)]
*  about a white family eating a burger. And they're like, Oh, we must return. Like that's how I feel [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5590.320000000001s)]
*  when I see like old Soviet posters and shit preaching unity, preaching fucking the honor [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5596.320000000001s)]
*  in labor, you know, emancipation from the chains of capital, all this shit. I'm like, we must return. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5603.84s)]
*  Could you explain why the NHS and Canadian health care system got significantly worse [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5616.64s)]
*  as a documentary was shot? Oh, no, because neoliberalism neoliberal assholes have [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5619.68s)]
*  underfunded these systems consistently with the hopes that they fucking perish. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5627.04s)]
*  I kind of like having a police department and fire department and the library. And I got to wondering, [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5633.84s)]
*  why don't we have more of these free socialized things like health care? When did this whole idea [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5651.28s)]
*  that every British citizen should have a right to health care? Well, if you go back, it all began [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5658.16s)]
*  with democracy. Before we had the vote, all the powers in the hand of rich people. If you had money, [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5663.92s)]
*  you could get health care, education, look after yourself when you were old. And what democracy did [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5671.04s)]
*  was to give the poor the vote. And it moved power from the marketplace to the polling station, [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5676.96s)]
*  from the wallet to the ballot. And what people said was very simple. They said in the 1930s, [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5684.24s)]
*  we had mass unemployment, but we don't have unemployment during the war. If you can have [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5691.12s)]
*  full employment by killing Germans, we're going to have full employment by building hospitals, [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5696.32s)]
*  building schools, recruiting nurses, recruiting teachers. If you can find money to kill people, [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5700.08s)]
*  you can find money to help people. Right. This outfit changes so funny. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5705.84s)]
*  Leaflet that was issued very, very straightforward. What year was this? This was 1948. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5712.8s)]
*  Your new national health service begins on the 5th of July. What is it? How do you get it? [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5718.320000000001s)]
*  It will provide you with all medical, dental and nursing care. Everyone, rich or poor, man, [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5723.68s)]
*  woman or child can use it or any part of it. There are no charges except for a few special items. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5730.4800000000005s)]
*  There is no insurance qualification, but it is not a charity. You are paying for it mainly as [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5737.04s)]
*  taxpayers and it will relieve your money worries in times of illness. Now, somehow that the few [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5742.8s)]
*  words sum the whole thing up. I was amazed when he said this all started in 1948. The British had [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5750.48s)]
*  just come out of a devastating experience through World War II. The country was destroyed and nearly [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5758.08s)]
*  bankrupt. They had nothing. In just one eight month period, over 42,000 civilians lost their [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5764.88s)]
*  lives. What we went through in two hours on 9-11, they went through nearly every single day. Remember [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5774.0s)]
*  how we all felt after 9-11, all of us pulling together? I guess that's how they felt. And the [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5781.2s)]
*  first way that they decided to pull together after the war was to provide free medical care [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5788.88s)]
*  for everyone. Gay, communist, why didn't they think about the for-profit interests of healthcare [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5795.2s)]
*  CEOs? Their GDP would be much higher. Stupid. Even Mrs. Thatcher said the National Health Service is [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5802.64s)]
*  safe in our hands. It's as non-controversial as votes for women. Nobody could come along and say, [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5811.04s)]
*  why should women have the vote now? Because people wouldn't have it and they wouldn't have it. Oh, [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5816.8s)]
*  don't worry. We're fixing that too soon. It takes time. Tony, Ben, don't worry with enough time, [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5820.8s)]
*  with enough time and with enough interest, it will come. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5827.2s)]
*  Britain, they wouldn't accept the deterioration or destruction of the national health. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5832.24s)]
*  If that's your Blair had said, I'm going to dismantle national health. There'd be no revolution. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5837.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Except, you know, Tony, Ben, who I believe has passed away, right? Yeah. On March [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5842.0s)]
*  14th, 2014, Tony Ben passed away. Now Tony, Ben didn't get to see, he only got to see the beginnings [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5852.16s)]
*  of this collapse. He got to experience the, the, the beautiful beginnings of austerity, [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5862.0s)]
*  which will inevitably lead to the demise of the NHS. And it will be crazy because his party will [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5868.64s)]
*  be responsible for it as well. Fun stuff to think about. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5873.52s)]
*  The report from the American medical association into the health of 55 to 64 year olds says Brits [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5883.92s)]
*  are far healthier than Americans for every illness that we looked at. Americans had more of it than [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5890.240000000001s)]
*  English. Cancer, heart disease, hypertension, strokes, lung disease, all significantly higher [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5896.72s)]
*  for Americans. Even the poorest people in England with all the environmental factors that give them [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5902.64s)]
*  the worst health in the country can expect to live longer than the wealthiest people in America. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5908.0s)]
*  I was wondering though, what's it like for the doctors here in Britain [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5919.92s)]
*  who have to live under this kind of state control? [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5924.0s)]
*  And you're a family doctor? Yeah, I suppose we'd call them GPs or general practitioners here. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5927.6s)]
*  Right. So you have like a family practice of? Yeah, it's an NHS practice. We have nine doctors [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5932.72s)]
*  within that practice. And you're paid for by the government? Paid for by the government. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5936.96s)]
*  So you work for the government? Oh yeah, absolutely. You're a government paid doctor? Absolutely. A [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5940.24s)]
*  patient comes to see you before you treat them. Do you have to call the government insurance company [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5943.52s)]
*  before you can treat them? No, I don't deal with money at all on an everyday basis. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5948.32s)]
*  Have you ever had to say no to someone who was sick and needed help? I hate this. I hate this. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5953.4400000000005s)]
*  They have no freedom. God, I hate this so much. They don't even know that they live under communism. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5958.0s)]
*  It's so sad. These poor British. They just don't understand. Like you have to you have to slap, [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5964.16s)]
*  you have to settle your fucking patients with like a shit ton of hidden fees. I don't understand. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5971.360000000001s)]
*  How are these hospitals still up and running? Well, I guess it doesn't really matter because [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5978.08s)]
*  they are no longer up and running. The conditions have worsened dramatically, like I said, because [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5984.24s)]
*  of tremendous austerity. No, never. Have you heard of anyone being in the hospital and being removed [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5988.32s)]
*  because they couldn't pay their bill? No, never. And I wouldn't want to work in that system. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=5997.5199999999995s)]
*  So working for the government, you probably have to use public transportation? [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6001.28s)]
*  No, so I have a I have a car that I use and you know, I drive an old beater. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6004.88s)]
*  You live in the kind of rough part. There you go. Another part. Another point for America. They're [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6009.28s)]
*  so lost that they're driving on the wrong fucking side of the road, dog. Classic. They don't even [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6013.76s)]
*  know you're not supposed to write on that side of the road. I'm telling you, dude, everything is [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6019.6s)]
*  wrong. Everything is wrong with this town. I mean, I live in a terrific part of town. It's called [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6023.36s)]
*  Greenwich. It's a lovely house. It's a three story house. How many other families have to [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6029.12s)]
*  live in that house with you? So we would live. That's four bedrooms, but my wife and my son, [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6034.16s)]
*  you know, it's just the three of us then. How much do you pay for that? [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6038.32s)]
*  Five hundred and fifty thousand. Yes. Yeah. So a million dollars. Yeah. You're a government [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6042.08s)]
*  paid doctor. Yes. On a national health insurance. Yeah. Shit's gotten really, I mean, so much worse [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6047.76s)]
*  on the housing side, too, for the record. Isn't it wonderful that every aspect of existence and [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6053.44s)]
*  liberal capitalist democracies have just gotten dramatically worse? It's so sick. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6058.8s)]
*  Healthcare plan here. Yes. And you live in a million. Stop preying on their downfall. Mother [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6064.0s)]
*  motherfucker. Whatever is happening to them is happening to us tenfold. At least they have [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6069.52s)]
*  some semblance of socialization that remains. You know what I mean? Any dollar home? Yes. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6073.68s)]
*  I think probably my friends think we do quite well. How well do you do? [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6082.16s)]
*  I earn around eighty five thousand including pension. Eighty five thousand pounds? Eighty [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6086.320000000001s)]
*  five thousand pounds a year. And that includes pension that they would pay. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6090.56s)]
*  In to me, they probably earn just over a hundred thousand pounds within my practice. Hundred [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6094.16s)]
*  thousand pounds. So that's almost two hundred thousand dollars. Yes, absolutely. The money that [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6098.08s)]
*  we earn, we get paid by what we do. So the better we do for our patients, then the more that we get [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6102.8s)]
*  paid. What do you mean? There's a new system. And in that new system, if the most number of [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6107.92s)]
*  your patients have low blood pressures or you get most of your patients to stop smoking or you get [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6114.88s)]
*  most of your patients to have things like mental health reviews if they're unwell or low cholesterol, [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6119.6s)]
*  then you get paid more. In other words, this year, if you get more people that are your patients to [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6123.92s)]
*  stop smoking, you'll get more money. Yes, absolutely. This year you'll earn more. Oh yeah. Remember [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6128.56s)]
*  what I told you about when the government pays for all healthcare, then they're truly invested in the [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6132.64s)]
*  public welfare of the citizenry because it is a negative incentive if they have to do more [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6138.4s)]
*  healthcare for no fucking reason. Communism. Once again, communism. OK, that's kind of literally [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6144.88s)]
*  what communism is about. But I'm saying it sarcastically. Like if you were to assume [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6151.679999999999s)]
*  communism is a pejorative and a negative, then that's like. Yeah, absolutely. So doctors in [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6156.96s)]
*  America do not necessarily have to fear having a universal healthcare. No, I think if you want to [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6163.04s)]
*  have two or three million dollar homes and four or five nice cars and six or seven nice televisions, [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6170.16s)]
*  then maybe, yeah, you need to practice somewhere where you can earn that. But I think we live [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6176.88s)]
*  comfortably here. And London is an expensive city, but I think we live very comfortably. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6181.76s)]
*  And you're getting by OK on the million dollar home, the Audi, and the flat screen TV. Yeah, [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6185.92s)]
*  we're coping with those. I think democracy is the most revolutionary thing in the world, [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6190.56s)]
*  far more revolutionary than socialist ideas or anybody else's idea. Because if you have power, [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6194.8s)]
*  you use it to meet the needs of you and your community. And this idea of choice, which [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6200.56s)]
*  capital talks about all the time, you've got to have a choice. Choice depends on the freedom to [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6206.080000000001s)]
*  choose. And if you're shackled with debt, you don't have a freedom to choose. It seems like [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6210.240000000001s)]
*  it benefits the system if the average working person is shackled with debt. People in debt [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6214.400000000001s)]
*  become hopeless and hopeless people don't vote. See, they will say should everyone should vote. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6220.0s)]
*  But I think if the poor in Britain or the United States turned out and voted for people who [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6224.96s)]
*  represented their interests, it would be a real democratic revolution. And so they don't want it [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6230.88s)]
*  to happen. So keeping people hopeless and pessimistic. See, I think there are two ways [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6235.68s)]
*  in which people are controlled. First of all, frighten people. And secondly, demoralize them. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6240.32s)]
*  An educated, healthy and confident nation is harder to govern. And I think there's an element [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6246.96s)]
*  in the thinking of some people, we don't want people to be educated, healthy and confident [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6252.88s)]
*  because they would get out of control. The top 1% of the world's population own 80% of the world's [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6257.84s)]
*  wealth. It's incredible that these guys in old school Keynesian and social democrat, the perfect [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6264.8s)]
*  example of a European politician offering more for their populace because of the tantalizing ideology [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6268.72s)]
*  of the USSR. Yeah. If there were more, I mean, he's a democratic socialist, by the way, he's not, [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6272.48s)]
*  he's not a social Democrat. But also if there were 100 Tony Benz in America, we would literally have, [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6278.08s)]
*  I mean, we would have, it would be like having is the equivalent of having [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6287.44s)]
*  a hundred Bernie Sanders's. I don't give a shit if they're not card carrying Marxist Leninist or [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6291.839999999999s)]
*  whatever. It doesn't matter. People put up with it, but they're poor. They're demoralized. They're [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6298.08s)]
*  frightened. And therefore they think perhaps the safest thing to do is take orders and hope for the [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6304.72s)]
*  best. And hope for the best is what we do. Right from the moment we're born, we've got the worst [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6310.24s)]
*  infant mortality rate in the Western world. A baby born in El Salvador has a better chance of surviving [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6315.6s)]
*  than a baby born in Detroit, but it gets better when we go to school. Classrooms with 40 students, [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6321.6s)]
*  schools with no science labs. No wonder the majority of our young adults can't find Britain [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6327.04s)]
*  on the map, but that's okay. There's always college. And by the time we graduate, our ass [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6331.44s)]
*  is so in hock, we're deep in debt before we even have our first job. I'm at about, we'll say about [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6336.16s)]
*  $35,000 in debt for, and that's for my third year in college. That's 2007, baby. That shit is like [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6341.76s)]
*  nothing now. Can you imagine being only in $35,000 in debt? Are you fucking kidding me? That way [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6347.84s)]
*  you'll be the kind of employee they're looking for. One who needs this job. 3,904, 3,905. And what [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6355.12s)]
*  employer wouldn't want to employ someone thousands of dollars in debt because they won't cause any [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6361.599999999999s)]
*  trouble? In addition to having to pay off your college debt, you need a job with health insurance. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6366.24s)]
*  It would be horrible to lose that kind of job, wouldn't it? You can always quit, you know. There's [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6371.12s)]
*  no law that says you have to work here. And if that one job doesn't pay all the bills, don't worry, [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6376.08s)]
*  you can get another one and another one and another one. I work three jobs and I feel like [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6381.68s)]
*  I contribute. You work three jobs, three jobs. Yes. Uniquely American, isn't it? I mean, that is [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6387.76s)]
*  fantastic that you're doing that. Yeah. Fantastic. Fucking asshole. He was shocked. Motherfucker, [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6393.92s)]
*  you're the president. How was that a good thing, dog? That's horrifying. Like if given the option, [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6400.72s)]
*  I saw a TikTok about how like the average European workday, someone was like making a joke about how [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6405.6s)]
*  like, oh, you know, I'm going to disco party later tonight. So I asked my boss if I could come in at [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6412.400000000001s)]
*  1pm, rather than the normal 11am that I come into the workplace. And I was just like, I was [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6422.88s)]
*  thinking in my mind, like it would be infinitely more preferable to actually only work the ridiculous [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6433.2s)]
*  hours presented in that fucking TikTok meme and have a much lower GDP overall. Okay. And also have [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6441.599999999999s)]
*  like, like all, all salaries go down across the board, but social programs make up for the broad [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6449.2s)]
*  majority of things that cause. Okay. This is a day in the life of European people. Yeah. So like, [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6457.12s)]
*  no, this isn't what I was looking for, but America is objectively a poorer country by default, [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6463.280000000001s)]
*  but everyone individually becomes wealthier. It's so much better. It's so much better for the planet. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6470.4800000000005s)]
*  It's so much better for the welfare of every single American citizen. Oh, no, it wasn't Nick Kroll. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6477.360000000001s)]
*  You suffer from excessive worry. You could be suffering from generalized anxiety disorder. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6492.8s)]
*  It could be adult ADD. Talk to your doctor. Ask your doctor. Ask your doctor. Ask your doctor. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6497.280000000001s)]
*  Ask your doctor. Yes. Ask your doctor and ask them for more drugs. That should keep you pretty [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6501.76s)]
*  doped up until it's time to retire. Did I say retire? Well, if you do make it to AD, I'm sure [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6506.8s)]
*  your pension will still be there. Unlike the new employees for these companies who will never see [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6511.6s)]
*  a pension, but don't worry. I'm sure our kids will take care of us considering the great life [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6515.12s)]
*  we've given them. Oh, and remember, let's defeat the terrorists over there so we don't have to [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6520.16s)]
*  fight them here. Kaiser Permanente is the largest HMO in the country and Don L. Keyes was fortunate [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=6524.8s)]

*  cancer vaccine well america has issues with lung cancer i'm sure that i'm sure that it's [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=8853.52s)]
*  readily available in the united states of america right right wait the united states embargo against [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=8859.84s)]

*  to tell me that cuba in spite of the profit incentive was able to wait wait it's against the [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=8876.16s)]
*  law to seek out this lung cancer vaccine i'm sure it's incredibly costly right i wonder if this [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=8885.519999999999s)]
*  article will mention how expensive it is it's got a it's probably like a million dollars right like [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=8894.56s)]
*  i assume like it's got to be it's got to be super expensive it costs approximately one u.s dollar per [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=8900.08s)]
*  shot to manufacture you know i'd rather die of lung cancer than get this goddamn socialist [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=8906.56s)]
*  medication okay that's what i say it's given by nurse practitioners so it doesn't even count [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=8913.439999999999s)]
*  china now has a diabetes vaccine slash cure i wonder if there's some kind of correlation i thought [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=8919.84s)]
*  that they were also doing i just yeah you might as well die a true american then fucking go to cuba [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=8923.36s)]
*  i asked them to give us the same exact care they give their fellow cuban citizens [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=8931.04s)]
*  no more no rather than profit incentive the reason in the u.s because drug development is super [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=8936.480000000001s)]
*  costly so companies need to oh no way dude dude companies need to offset the risk that's so crazy [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=8940.720000000001s)]
*  drug development is famously not costly anywhere else why didn't i think of that dude why didn't i [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=8947.84s)]
*  think of that it's not actually the profit motive it's the thing that we're saying is not the profit [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=8953.6s)]
*  motive as a substitute for the profit motive even though it is the profit motive it's those pesky [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=8958.64s)]
*  regulations it's just crazy because uh it's still publicly funded research that these guys uh get [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=8963.04s)]
*  the patents from but you know a lot of the novel chemical compound discovery actually happens in the [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=8968.960000000001s)]
*  publicly funded research side but i guess there's got to be some reason for why there's so much r&d [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=8975.359999999999s)]
*  spending happening in the pharmaceutical industry outside of the publicly funded uh labs oh that's [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=8981.68s)]
*  right they're doing research and development to develop new ways to juggle patents to ensure that [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=8990.32s)]
*  they continue sitting on patents extending it by seven years year over year to ensure that there's [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWpDOBzTAI&t=8995.439999999999s)]
