# NOPD vs Unarmed Civilians - Danziger Bridge - 19th Years Later - Sept 4. 2005 | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY)
*  of something bad happening to you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=0.0s)]
*  Okay? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  If police and police presence disproportionately harm people of color, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  there is a high likelihood of an interaction turning south with a cop, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  especially when these structures have allowed a police officer to do whatever they want to you. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=14.6s)]
*  Okay? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=20.8s)]
*  From the city, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=21.8s)]
*  New Orleans Police Department versus unarmed civilians, the Danzinger Bridge, 19 years later. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=27.200000000000003s)]
*  New Orleans. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=33.0s)]
*  If you want to understand what the looting panic turns into, here is a terrifying story. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=34.8s)]
*  Nearly empty, still partly underwater, and waiting for life and hope to return. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=41.400000000000006s)]
*  Welcome to another episode of InRange. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=46.8s)]
*  Yes, this is a repubblication of a video that I filmed nine years ago. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=49.2s)]
*  I sat on this footage for four years and wasn't sure what to do with it, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=53.0s)]
*  and published it in realizing that these things needed to be talked about more, not less, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=56.2s)]
*  especially with the events going on in that year. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=59.6s)]
*  And this video is being republished on the 19th anniversary of the events discussed in this video. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=62.6s)]
*  And 19 years later, it's hard to look around and say that anything's really gotten better. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=67.60000000000001s)]
*  All the men that were ostensibly police officers that killed these people and maimed a family, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=72.0s)]
*  are now out and free. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=77.8s)]
*  And situations like this are recurring over and over and over again. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=80.2s)]
*  And if another disaster like Katrina were to happen again today, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=84.0s)]
*  I don't think it would be any different. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=87.0s)]
*  And that's a problem. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=89.0s)]
*  And that's an issue we need to face. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=90.0s)]
*  And a situation in which we have to understand that there's something wrong [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=91.8s)]
*  when agents of the state can come and kill you based on your color, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=95.0s)]
*  your identity, whether or not you own a gun, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=99.8s)]
*  whether or not they think you might have had a gun or not, whether you do or don't. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=103.0s)]
*  And then do things like try to cover it up with, quote, a ham sandwich or a drop gun. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=106.0s)]
*  Or worse, don't even try to cover it up and realize that qualified immunity and the system will protect them. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=111.0s)]
*  Don't be afraid to be in suit. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=117.0s)]
*  Everybody gets sued. Just a chance for overtime. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=118.2s)]
*  Colology. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=120.4s)]
*  Now, did some of these men serve some time in prison? Yes. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=122.0s)]
*  Did they serve the time that you or I would have received for doing what they did? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=125.8s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=129.6s)]
*  So in this instance, when we hear Lieutenant Colonel Grossman talk about how they are the samurai. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=131.4s)]
*  Well, he's right. They are held at a higher rank than the rest of us. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=136.20000000000002s)]
*  I saw on Twitter that your house burned down. Is that true? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=140.8s)]
*  What do you think? Does it look like it's burned down? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=143.0s)]
*  Am I streaming for the from the ashes? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=146.0s)]
*  Civilians here in this country and the militarization of the police [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  and the situations that are occurring within it and the systemic problems that are occurring because of it continue 19 years later. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=153.6s)]
*  I hope you watch this video. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=160.4s)]
*  I hope you think about the fact that this is still going on today and take a moment to remember the lives lost on that day on September 4th, 2005, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=162.20000000000002s)]
*  when people were just trying to find some water in a natural disaster that was actually manmade [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=170.4s)]
*  due to the inefficiency of the U.S. government in protecting the city with its levies [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=176.4s)]
*  and corporations allowing derricks to crash through levies and flood entire neighborhoods here. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=182.20000000000002s)]
*  If you want to learn more about that, check this video above regarding the Battle of New Orleans. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=187.8s)]
*  Anyways, a somber note on a somber day 19 years later, please watch. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=193.4s)]
*  Thank you for tuning in to an episode of InRange. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=199.10000000000002s)]
*  This is a difficult topic today. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=201.60000000000002s)]
*  During Katrina, we were out of power and listening to a radio news report from a NG helicopter flying over NOLA. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=204.20000000000002s)]
*  The reporter was talking about the floods until we heard shots. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=210.10000000000002s)]
*  And one of the NG goons said, I got that and the broadcast cut out stuck with me to this day. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=212.8s)]
*  And the footage you're going to see was filmed four years ago. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=218.70000000000002s)]
*  Yes, four years ago. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=222.3s)]
*  And the reason I've been sitting on this video content is because I haven't been sure when I could publish it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=225.0s)]
*  The reality is that I've been waiting for an opportunity to publish this video in which it would not be seen in the light of the current situation or current events, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=230.5s)]
*  because people would think that I'm publishing this in response to a current event. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=239.1s)]
*  And the reality is there's never been a chance in four years to publish this video where it wouldn't see. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=243.5s)]
*  You said the fear of living your day to day life is dumb. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=250.1s)]
*  That why do you talk about how systemic racism still exists, which people fear any interaction with a cop, which definitely isn't healthy. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=253.1s)]
*  OK, I don't think you understand. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=259.5s)]
*  Think about it like the statistical likelihood of something bad happening to you. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=262.20000000000005s)]
*  OK, if police and police presence disproportionately harm people of color, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=269.20000000000005s)]
*  there is a high high likelihood of an interaction turning south with a cop, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=275.5s)]
*  especially when the structures have allowed a police officer to do whatever they want to you. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=280.90000000000003s)]
*  OK, on the other hand, given that you are surrounded by hundreds of thousands of people living in a densely packed city environment on a day to day basis, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=287.3s)]
*  the likelihood of you being a victim of a crime is infinitely lower in any random interaction. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=297.9s)]
*  There is a there is a reasonable fear to have or a reasonable assessment and an unreasonable one. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=305.59999999999997s)]
*  That's the argument that I'm making. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=311.9s)]
*  OK, you're more likely to be struck by lightning. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=314.20000000000005s)]
*  They get killed by a cop. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=316.40000000000003s)]
*  That's really interesting that you said that because I wasn't talking about a police just killing you. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=317.5s)]
*  OK, that's not what I was stating. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=322.20000000000005s)]
*  Do you understand? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=324.1s)]
*  Also, how many people die by lightning every? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=325.1s)]
*  Wait, there is no way that's true. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=328.20000000000005s)]
*  How many people die by lightning every year in the US? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=330.5s)]
*  Because chatter, you are so incredibly wrong. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=337.20000000000005s)]
*  OK, you are 100 times you there are 100 times more people that die in the hands of cops every year than get killed by lightning. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=341.5s)]
*  Why did you say that 20 people die by lightning every year in the United States of America? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=353.0s)]
*  Two thousand people die by cops or maybe not 2000. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=359.3s)]
*  What is it? Let's see police killings in. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=363.0s)]
*  Oh, it's not because of race. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=367.1s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=369.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=370.2s)]
*  So you just put forth a completely ridiculous number and then immediately got disproven and then moved on to say, oh, that's not the case. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=370.7s)]
*  I say it's just stupid. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=379.7s)]
*  Stop. It's not about race. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=381.2s)]
*  It's not about race at all. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=382.5s)]
*  It's not 2000. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=383.8s)]
*  It's 1000. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=384.8s)]
*  I apologize. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=385.8s)]
*  So not 100 times more likely, but 50 times police kill around a thousand people. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=386.8s)]
*  Give or take every single year, the 50 X multiplier. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=393.5s)]
*  Listen, bro, as far as violence goes, an estimated 250,000 civilian injuries are caused by law enforcement officers annually. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=398.40000000000003s)]
*  Fifteen percent of civilians who experienced police threat of use of force during legal interventions are injured. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=406.3s)]
*  250,000 civilians are injured by law enforcement officers annually. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=412.1s)]
*  It's not just about if someone dies of a police attack is likely not because of race. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=417.8s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=423.2s)]
*  Yeah, there are races of cause. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=424.8s)]
*  I don't know why you're in here trying to argue something that I wasn't even saying. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=426.0s)]
*  This is like what you are trying to argue. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=430.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=433.6s)]
*  Police are disproportionately more like police have a higher likelihood of targeting you and even apprehending you and arresting you. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=434.40000000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=445.1s)]
*  If you are not white, that's it seen as a commentary on a current event. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=445.7s)]
*  So I'm going to give up on that idea because it's never going to happen. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=452.1s)]
*  And I'm going to publish it because I think it's important to be published. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=455.4s)]
*  One of the topics that I, Carl, cover here on InRange TV, are issues of historical significance that I believe are intentionally left out of the general populations narrative. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=458.9s)]
*  Culturally lost, whether it is Old West or modern, things that have been intentionally left off of the general understanding is something that I believe should be brought to light [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=468.7s)]
*  because it's those topics that really give us insight into society, whether it's historical or current. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=478.0s)]
*  And the one that I'm covering today is about the number of innocent and unarmed civilians on Danziger Bridge, September 4th, 2005, just a few days after Hurricane Katrina. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=484.09999999999997s)]
*  And while you are inevitably going to paint this in the light of whatever current event is going on today, whether you're watching it right now in May of 2020 or watching it in November of 2025, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=495.29999999999995s)]
*  I have an unsettling feeling that there'll be something going on in this country that will make you think that this video was published in response to that. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=506.1s)]
*  And that is not the case. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=513.3000000000001s)]
*  I also am going to dub in moments through this video, things that I have been able to find out more after the fact and hopefully correct the narrative. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=515.2s)]
*  The other thing that I do want you to understand is that this is wholly my work. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=521.4s)]
*  Okay, I'm not going to watch this whole thing. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=526.2s)]
*  It's about... [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makbG9TfkkY&t=528.3000000000001s)]
