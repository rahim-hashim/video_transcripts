**HasanAbi:** [September 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk)
*  Yes, yes, yes. Oh my God. Yes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=0.0s)]
*  That I am entirely supportive of is the pause that we put on the end. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=3.24s)]
*  So there is some leverage that we have had in used. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=8.36s)]
*  What? Ultimately, the thing that is. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=12.08s)]
*  Everything else in that region is getting this deal done. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=15.44s)]
*  Kamala's talking about right now, really? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=25.68s)]
*  For Israel to defend itself. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=27.72s)]
*  Yo, all right, we're going right into it. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=29.96s)]
*  I'm blasting off at odds with what Benjamin Netanyahu has said [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=32.24s)]
*  is their right to defense. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=36.4s)]
*  If it matters, as you say, how Israel defends itself, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=39.08s)]
*  where do you see the line between aggression and defense [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=42.96s)]
*  and our power as Israel's ally? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=46.4s)]
*  Such a good question to to do something. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=48.56s)]
*  Oh, oh, oh, oh, unpacking what you just said. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  So let's start with this. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  I absolutely believe that this war has to end [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=55.16s)]
*  and it has to end as soon as possible. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=60.12s)]
*  And the way that will be achieved is by getting a hostage deal [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  and the ceasefire deal done. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=67.72s)]
*  And we are working around the clock to achieve that end. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=69.52s)]
*  Stepping back October 7, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=73.52s)]
*  1200 Israelis were slaughtered, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=76.44s)]
*  but actually in some Americans, by the way, in that number, slaughtered. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  Young people who are attending a concert, women were horribly raped. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=85.28s)]
*  And yes, so I have said Israel has a right to defend itself. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=90.32s)]
*  We would. And but madam, but let me finish. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=93.92s)]
*  I ask is that no, no, no, no aggression and it's important to put it in. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=97.16s)]
*  Yeah. What is going on? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=100.88s)]
*  Dude, ABC has been correct on this, bro. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=102.64s)]
*  ABC is kind of out of control far to that's the ABC woman, right? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=105.52s)]
*  Palestinians have been pushing women and get her ass. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=110.16s)]
*  Oh, my God. Oh, my God. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=113.64s)]
*  Oh, my God. David Muir and the entire cast, the ABC [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=116.32s)]
*  journalists, I will kiss all of you in the mouth. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  Bro, she just keeps repeating the same line. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=131.76s)]
*  I'm going to lose. I'm losing my mind. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=134.0s)]
*  Bro, she's such a robot. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=143.28s)]
*  She's such a robot, dude. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=144.92s)]
*  Have self-determination and dignity. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=146.6s)]
*  This is literally like Joe Biden level dementia to support Palestinians [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=149.2s)]
*  in their right to self-determination. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=154.16s)]
*  And is it even possible as Israel's ally? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=157.16s)]
*  Well, absolutely. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=160.16s)]
*  I will tell you, I have been actively involved [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=161.92s)]
*  in, for example, meeting not only with. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=167.32s)]
*  I'm not going to. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=170.24s)]
*  I'm not going to use this one yet. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=171.0s)]
*  Hold on to talk about how we can construct a day after scenario [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=172.96s)]
*  where we participate in ensuring those exact goals that I outlined, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=180.92000000000002s)]
*  including as part of the principles that should be applied to those goals, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=187.24s)]
*  that there be no reoccupation of that, there be no changing of the territorial [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=191.88s)]
*  lines, that there be an ability to have security in the region for all concerned [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=196.68s)]
*  in a way that we create stability and let us also recognize in a way that ensures [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=206.6s)]
*  that Iran is not empowered in this whole scenario in terms of the peace [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=212.24s)]
*  and stability of the region. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=217.44s)]
*  This is as. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=218.56s)]
*  Absolutely. The United States of America. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=219.32s)]
*  This is as. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  Which is why we have been. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=223.64s)]
*  She's filibustered. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=224.79999999999998s)]
*  With the Qataris and the Egyptians around attempting to. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=225.84s)]
*  Oh, my gosh, she's so bad at this. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=229.32s)]
*  And get it done as quickly as possible. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  She's so bad at this. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=233.04s)]
*  To follow up really quick. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=234.35999999999999s)]
*  But is there a specific policy change that you as president of the United States [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=235.28s)]
*  would say you would do that? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=240.4s)]
*  Here, we're blasting off. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=242.04s)]
*  Let the people know. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=243.35999999999999s)]
*  For emphasizing the humanity of Palestinians. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=244.4s)]
*  But what I often hear from folks is that there's no policy change that would [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=247.84s)]
*  that that either you or the president, President Biden, have gone and said [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=252.8s)]
*  they would do. Is there a specific policy change as president that you would do [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=256.64s)]
*  in our helping of Israel? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=260.16s)]
*  We need to get this deal done and we need to get it done immediately. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=262.16s)]
*  And that is my position. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=266.48s)]
*  And that is my policy. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=267.68s)]
*  We need to get this deal done. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=269.2s)]
*  But in the way that we send in the way that we interact as their ally. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=270.52s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes, yes. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=273.64s)]
*  Well, you do, for example, yes. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=275.28s)]
*  Oh, my God. Yes. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=276.72s)]
*  That I am entirely supportive of is the pause that we've put on the [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=278.08s)]
*  and so there is some leverage that we have had in use. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=282.32s)]
*  What? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=286.24s)]
*  Ultimately, the thing that is. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=287.44s)]
*  Everything else in that region is getting this deal done. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=290.0s)]
*  And I can I'm not going to disclose private conversations, but I will tell you, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=293.76s)]
*  I've had direct conversations with the prime minister, with the president of Israel, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=298.96s)]
*  with Egyptian leaders and with our allies. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=306.4s)]
*  And I think we've made ourselves very clear this deal needs to get done in the best [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=310.08s)]
*  interest of everyone in the region, including getting those hostages out who I mean, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=316.24s)]
*  we saw the latest example of what happened with the six most recently, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=322.32s)]
*  one of whom was an American citizen. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=328.0s)]
*  But what do you say to those that say that's not enough, that stopping the 2000 [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=330.08s)]
*  upon the one time wasn't enough, that this administration and your possible [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=334.12s)]
*  administration have to do more? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=338.16s)]
*  Well, we are doing the work of putting the pressure on all parties involved to get the deal done. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=340.24s)]
*  But let me be very clear also, Israel is right to defend itself. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=347.52000000000004s)]
*  Support Israel's ability to defend itself. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=352.0s)]
*  Yeah, I called it. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=355.12s)]
*  I support the need for Palestinians to have dignity, self-determination and security as we move [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=357.12s)]
*  forward and get a two state deal done. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=366.56s)]
*  But right now, the thing we need to get done is this hostage deal and the ceasefire deal. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=370.08s)]
*  We need a ceasefire. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=374.8s)]
*  We need the hostage deal. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=375.76s)]
*  I want to switch gears to racial justice, Madam Vice President. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=377.36s)]
*  Last month, you eulogize Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=380.88s)]
*  Jackson Lee's signature bill, one of a few was H.R. 40, which would create a commission [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=384.88s)]
*  to study the history of US slavery and study the issue of reparations. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=391.44s)]
*  She introduced H.R. 40 every session of Congress, taking up the mantle from Congressman John [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=395.76s)]
*  Conyers. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=400.71999999999997s)]
*  This is a bill that you have co-sponsored as a US Senator. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=401.68s)]
*  Yet, this has, despite the fact that this has been, similar commissions have been created [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=404.71999999999997s)]
*  on the state level and on the local level, it's yet to pass in Congress, let alone come [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=410.56s)]
*  out of committee. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=415.03999999999996s)]
*  Congresswoman Jackson Lee, Congresswoman Barbara Lee and other advocates have called [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=416.24s)]
*  for President Biden to take executive action to create this commission. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=420.56s)]
*  Would you as president take executive action to create this commission, or do you believe [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=426.64s)]
*  that it should happen in Congress? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=432.88s)]
*  Well, first of all, as you mentioned, Sheila Jackson Lee, she was an extraordinary leader [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=434.48s)]
*  who we just recently lost. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=440.08s)]
*  And she was a friend and a real champion for so many issues. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=441.68s)]
*  So I feel compelled to say that about her. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=447.36s)]
*  On the issue of what we need to do. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=451.12s)]
*  I'm telling you, I've had multiple people who know better than me that she's gagged [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=454.16s)]
*  by the state at the moment. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=456.96s)]
*  No. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=458.24s)]
*  No, she's a bot, dude. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=458.88s)]
*  No way. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=460.96s)]
*  No way. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=462.32s)]
*  She just repeats the same over and over again. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=462.8s)]
*  And she wanted to be like, oh, pause on. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=464.8s)]
*  We did that once. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=467.52s)]

*  Arrogant history. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=469.44s)]
*  No way. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=470.32s)]
*  In terms of the generational impact of slavery, the generational impact of redlining, of Jim [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=470.8s)]
*  Kroll, I could go on and on and on. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=478.16s)]
*  These are facts that have had impact. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=480.24s)]
*  And we need to speak truth about it. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=483.52s)]
*  She's off script. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=486.8s)]
*  She's ass, by the way. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=488.40000000000003s)]
*  Straight up. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=489.84000000000003s)]
*  And frankly, I think that we, and part of that is studying it to figure out exactly [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=490.72s)]
*  what we need to do. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=496.48s)]
*  But part of what we can do is- [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=497.52s)]
*  It's alarming how bad she is off script. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=499.68s)]
*  In terms of building an opportunity economy, which is addressing explicitly the obstacles. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=502.0s)]
*  No, it's not ABC. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=508.40000000000003s)]
*  It's not. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=509.44s)]
*  I thought it was the ABC Journalist. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=510.08s)]
*  But Eugene Daniels is the goat that was pushing. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=511.68s)]
*  And Tanya Mosley asked some pretty good questions, too. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=516.24s)]
*  What we need to do in terms of dealing with an issue that I have championed for years, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=519.92s)]
*  black maternal mortality, which is the fact that black women are three to four times [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=525.2s)]
*  more likely to die in connection with childbirth than other women. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=529.28s)]
*  And we know that the reasons for that include disparities that pre-exist her premise. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=533.12s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=540.56s)]
*  I never thought someone from the Y network and Politico would be the most adversarial [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=541.28s)]
*  questions that this administration has faced thus far on Israel. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=549.92s)]
*  It's literally like Joe Biden doing a complex interview and then getting questions about, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=554.48s)]
*  like, not even complex because like Politico is obviously a very serious like institution. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=559.6s)]
*  It's just they're very right wing, which is why it's shocking to me that a Politico journalist [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=566.4s)]
*  did that. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=572.3199999999999s)]
*  And I think that was part of the spirit behind the congressional action thus far to ensure that [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=575.68s)]
*  everyone can participate in this conversation in a way that why is, why is the, is the affiliate, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=582.64s)]
*  right? Like I think for a second, I thought why was O W N, but I think why Philadelphia is the [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=588.56s)]
*  public media for Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey. Like, that's not a joke. That's like, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=596.3199999999999s)]
*  that's that's public radio. So-called leaders that's solid. So that's not surprising that it's [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=600.2399999999999s)]
*  Tanya Mosley was the one who was like asking those, those questions, but like Politico is [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=605.92s)]
*  pretty right wing. You know, I want to move to Springfield, Ohio and what's when are they [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=610.64s)]
*  right wing? Not my experience actually curious. Fuck you me. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=614.8s)]
*  ...the home because of conspiracy theories that I will repeat here, but they have been repeated by [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=618.24s)]
*  leaders on the Republican side, President Trump, Vice President, excuse me, former President Trump, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=625.5999999999999s)]
*  Vice and Vice Presidential nominee, JD Vance. From your perspective, is this just a case of [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=631.8399999999999s)]
*  irredeemable that can't be mitigated by any rational action or is this a situation which [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=637.92s)]
*  a federal response could help this community heal? Resources and- [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=644.08s)]
*  Well, I'll let you finish and then I'll speak. It's a crying shame. I mean, my heart breaks. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=650.1600000000001s)]
*  Say you're the daughter of immigrants. Say immigrants are the backbone of this country. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=656.48s)]
*  Please say anything. Please. Elementary school children who it was- [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=659.36s)]
*  Bro, this dude is cooking by the way. They both are. Eugene and Tanya, you are my goats. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=665.0400000000001s)]
*  Going to school on picture day. Oh, he follows me. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=671.12s)]
*  Who are dressed up in their best, got all ready. I'm going to DM him right now. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=675.52s)]
*  The night before and had to be evacuated. Children, children, a whole community put in fear. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=679.36s)]
*  And I'll say a couple things about it. One, you know, I learned a long time ago in my career, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=687.36s)]
*  having a background- I just DM them to say thank you. That's it. That's all I said. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=693.28s)]
*  When you have these positions, when you have that kind of microphone in front of you, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=697.04s)]
*  you really ought to understand at a very deep level how much your words have meaning. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=701.68s)]
*  I learned at a very young stage in my career that the meaning of my words could impact whether [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=706.16s)]
*  somebody was free or in prison. As attorney general, I was of California, fifth largest [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=712.48s)]
*  economy in the world. I was acutely aware that my words could move markets. When you are- [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=718.48s)]
*  This is the most boring way to tackle the subject matter. Okay, notes on this. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=724.0s)]
*  This is so boring. Just say this is a goddamn pogrom. Okay? They are doing blood libel. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=729.04s)]
*  Please just say they're being ridiculous. They're being weird. They are trying to [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=737.04s)]
*  invoke hate. They want you to hate your neighbors. And then flip it back to [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=742.88s)]
*  remember the past. A lot of people forgot what it felt like in your heart to live under the Trump [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=752.9599999999999s)]
*  administration. We still obviously don't like Trump. A lot of Americans don't like Trump. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=758.56s)]
*  But people forgot how frustrating it was for millions of people with no sense of reality [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=766.56s)]
*  to feel so emboldened in this way. That's the worst angle. Who gives a fuck about cops, man? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=776.48s)]
*  Oh my God. These are people. They're black people too. Like you're a black woman. You are the [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=795.2s)]
*  daughter of immigrants. They are trying to incite a race riot against black immigrants. Please. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=803.28s)]
*  Who gives a fuck about the police resources? This is not new. This is not new in terms of these [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=811.4399999999999s)]
*  tropes. This is not new in terms of where it's coming from. And whether it is refusing to rent [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=816.72s)]
*  to people, rent to black families, whether it is taking out a full page ad in the New York Times [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=825.04s)]
*  against five innocent black and Latino teenagers, the Central Park Five calling for their execution. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=832.48s)]
*  What are you doing? Oh my God. She's literally a bot, bro. She is actually a bot. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=839.12s)]
*  Whether it is referring to the press in the United States with a lie, birther lies. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=844.0799999999999s)]
*  And look. Talk about the current. Talk about the current. Talk about the current. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=848.3199999999999s)]
*  I do believe more. Talk about the current shit. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=852.0s)]
*  I do believe that. I know. I know. The vast majority of us as Americans know we have so much more in [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=854.4s)]
*  common than what separates us. I know that. She cannot. She cannot gun to her head, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=861.76s)]
*  say she wants to defend immigrants. She can't. She cannot. That's why she's talking about like, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=869.04s)]
*  oh, Trump is being, remember when he did the Central Park Five ad? That's from like 1994, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=875.28s)]
*  man. What the fuck are you talking about? That you cannot be entrusted with standing behind [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=880.96s)]
*  the president. Say it. Engaging in that hateful rhetoric that as usual is designed to divide us [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=886.3199999999999s)]
*  as a country. Verbatim repeating debate lines like and trying to fit them into this conversation, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=898.16s)]
*  a dynamic conversation with journalists who are obviously very smart and very thoughtful. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=904.9599999999999s)]
*  This is not going to fly. For chatters who are saying like she's a fascist, she believes this. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=911.1999999999999s)]
*  Now come on, bro. No. Don't be deluded. Okay? Like, again, she is not Hillary Clinton. Okay? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=919.76s)]
*  She is literally a black woman. Of course, she is not like straight up genuinely a firm believer [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=929.12s)]
*  that like immigrants are causing like massive problems in this country. Are you insane? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=936.24s)]
*  Her father and her mother are immigrants. What the fuck? It doesn't matter that she was a prosecutor. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=943.28s)]
*  Come on, dude. There are certain parts of your identity and your development that are so formative [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=948.08s)]
*  that like you're not going to deny it. Like she's not Candace Owens. Okay? Calm down. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=953.6800000000001s)]
*  Okay. That's what it is. This isn't like genuinely, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=958.24s)]
*  Kamala Harris is a firm believer that Haitians are eating cats. That's why she can't talk on it. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=968.72s)]
*  No, she's a coward. That's why she won't talk on it. No, it's not. It's much more frustrating. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=973.04s)]
*  I promise you it's much more frustrating. Okay? She's weakest on this issue because she's scared. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=979.36s)]
*  Okay. Look at how decisive she is on this. Look at how decisive she is on assault. Okay? Look at [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=987.68s)]
*  she stands on business when it comes to that the Democratic Party as a machine have decided are [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=998.2399999999999s)]
*  our issues and we're going to assume a position on this and we're going to hammer it. Think about [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1005.28s)]
*  the difference in the energy between this and the last statement. I don't believe for a moment [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1013.84s)]
*  that she gives a **** about Palestinians. Okay? If you were to ask me like secretly behind closed [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1024.16s)]
*  doors, is she like super pro Palestine and can't say it? No, I don't think she gives a single [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1029.04s)]
*  goddamn shred of a ****. Okay? But on the issue of migrants, like bro, she's literally the product [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1033.3600000000001s)]
*  of migrants. There is zero percent chance that she genuinely believes that like immigrants are [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1039.12s)]
*  doing. She doesn't believe it. She doesn't believe it, but she's too much of a coward to openly say [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1043.52s)]
*  it. Why? Because she saw the polls. She saw the polls where 60% of Americans want mass deportations [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1049.36s)]
*  and she is terrified and her handlers have told her never to make a single peep about this. Do [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1056.8s)]
*  not come across as though you're pro immigrant. This is going to be the massive issue that the [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1063.52s)]
*  Republicans will clobber you on. Be as right wing as possible on this issue. That is a mistake. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1067.68s)]
*  That is a mistake that the Democratic Party has been repeating over and over and over and over [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1073.1200000000001s)]
*  again. These are lies. Okay? The Republican Party is lying. Please talk about the Lebanon attacks. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1076.88s)]
*  I'm going to literally explode my pager. Okay? I'm going to go purchase a pager and except [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1084.8s)]
*  we're going to obviously get to it. Okay? So you're raising a very important issue that has [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1089.92s)]
*  many facets, including what we need to do in terms of reasonable gun safety laws and what we need to [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1096.8s)]
*  do around crime prevention. Also the top of the hour ad break is about to explode in your face [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1104.3999999999999s)]
*  unless you subscribe. Homicide cases for $3. She doesn't seem to care about the polls. Yeah, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1109.44s)]
*  there's a higher order there. There's a higher priority there, which is the State Department [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1115.36s)]
*  interest, which is obviously the interest of money donors that are donating to the Democratic Party. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1121.12s)]
*  The fact that she's terrified of the media will actually push back on her if she were to switch [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1129.28s)]
*  positions on like those are all things that she thinks will rock the boat. I am telling you those [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1136.24s)]
*  things would rock the boat in a positive direction, not in a negative direction, but it doesn't fucking [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1143.36s)]
*  matter. Okay? It's real. It has had a profound impact in terms of trauma that for the most part, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1148.08s)]
*  here's the three minute ad break now. The trauma that exists in communities. I get what you're [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1156.0s)]

*  Nah. That's not true. Every adult in this country that is invested in politics knows that it's a lie, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1164.48s)]
*  the idea that migrants are doing an insane amount of crimes is a lie. They just know that [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1174.24s)]
*  anecdotes are very powerful and they can't deal with it. Okay? They can't deal with those [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1179.68s)]
*  anecdotes that are too good. They're too good for political messaging. Same happened with crime, dude. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1185.44s)]
*  Same exact shit happened with crime. We were able to pass the first meaningful gun safety [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1191.04s)]
*  legislation in 30 years. And part of what that involved was millions and millions of dollars [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1197.6s)]
*  to put more mental health counselors in public schools, right? Because we know that there is an [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1205.12s)]
*  aspect of this. But you think she's just scared until she's liked it now and, and dealing with it [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1211.52s)]
*  at it. Chat, you need to understand something. Democrats don't legislate a more progressive [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1216.6399999999999s)]
*  agenda than they claimed when they're running. They do the exact opposite. Okay. They, they actually, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1221.12s)]
*  they actually legislate in the opposite direction. They legislate to the middle and they still lose [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1229.1999999999998s)]
*  resources into community based intervention that is requiring on the good people in the community [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1233.28s)]
*  to volunteer to do the intervention, but actually paying people to do it. Cause it's a full-time job. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1239.28s)]
*  It's about understanding what we need to do to again, understand that to your point, we have to [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1244.72s)]
*  have a holistic response to this issue and prioritize it instead of reacting to the tragedy that sadly [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1252.24s)]
*  they are too predictable. Let's all agree enough of that. There are very few solutions that we [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1259.6000000000001s)]
*  haven't thought of. We need to put the resources into them. Madam vice president, we want to move [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1264.88s)]
*  to the topic of reproductive access, something that you have worked and leading on both for the [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1269.84s)]
*  administration Democrats and, and now the top of the ticket. You've said that as president, you [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1274.0s)]
*  would want to codify a role. If it came to your desk, you would sign a bill that did that. Role [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1278.64s)]
*  protected access until fetal viability, which it also says is quote at about seven months, but it [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1283.2s)]
*  may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks. So do you similarly support also codifying roles restrictions, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1289.6s)]
*  which allowed States to ban abortion in the third trimester of pregnancy unless necessary to save [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1296.24s)]
*  the mother's life? We need to put the protections of Roe v. Wade back into law. And when that bill [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1301.6s)]
*  gets passed by Congress, I will proudly sign it into law. Understand what is happening in our [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1306.48s)]
*  country. Over 20 States have passed what I call Trump abortion bans because I understand how we [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1312.56s)]
*  got here. The former president handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court with [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1318.0s)]
*  the intention they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. They did as he intended. And in state [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1322.1599999999999s)]
*  after state, laws have been passed criminalizing health care providers. I don't know if anyone [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1327.6s)]
*  here has heard most recently the stories out of Georgia. Tragic story about a young woman who died [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1332.08s)]
*  because it appears the people who should have given her health care were afraid they'd be criminalized [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1338.48s)]
*  after the the Dobbs decision came down. Laws that make no exception even for rape or incest, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1345.52s)]
*  which means that you're telling a survivor of a crime of a violation to their body [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1351.4399999999998s)]
*  that they have no right to make a decision about what happens to their body next, which is immoral. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1356.1599999999999s)]
*  The an approach that doesn't take into account that most people I think agree you don't have [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1362.1599999999999s)]
*  to abandon your faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1366.9599999999998s)]
*  what to do with her body. If she chooses she will talk with her pastor, her priest, her rabbi, her [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1372.7199999999998s)]
*  imam, but it should not be the government or Donald Trump telling her what to do about her own body [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1378.0s)]
*  in her life. So that's where I stand. We need to put back in place the protection of Roe v. Wade [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1384.32s)]
*  and put that into law. And those restrictions that are also in place. We need to put back in [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1390.0s)]
*  place the protections of Roe v. Wade and let an individual in consultation with her doctor [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1395.28s)]
*  make the decision based on what she can determine because she's smart enough to know [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1401.9199999999998s)]
*  what's in her best interest instead of having her government tell her what to do, [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1406.08s)]
*  especially a bunch of people in these state capitals who think they're in a better position [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1409.4399999999998s)]
*  to tell her what to do than she is to know what's in her best interest. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1412.96s)]
*  Before we conclude, Madam Vice President, Joyful Warrior has been used to describe your campaign. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1416.16s)]
*  You didn't see that just a minute ago. Okay, back to my Joyful Warrior. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1421.2s)]
*  And your opponent and Republicans have at times weaponized you laughing in campaign ads, for [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1425.1200000000001s)]
*  example. Why is joy important to you to insert into this election? And what do you make of [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1433.6000000000001s)]
*  Republicans using that as a way to suggest that you're not a serious candidate? [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1441.68s)]
*  Well, sometimes I think, and I'll say to whoever the young people are who are watching this, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1446.72s)]
*  there are sometimes when your adversaries will try and turn your strength into a weakness. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1451.44s)]
*  Don't you let them. Don't you let them. I find joy in the American people. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1456.4s)]
*  I get the haters, but there's no shot. You can expect Trump not to exponentially make everything [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1462.0s)]
*  worse in terms of foreign policy and women's rights. Man, I'm sick and tired of having this [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1466.56s)]
*  conversation every goddamn election cycle. A lot of you say, oh, we want to vote for the Democrats [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1470.32s)]
*  because at least they'll listen to you when they're literally in the process of not listening to you. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1475.6s)]
*  Okay, shut the fuck up. Just say you want your team to win and you don't actually give up and you have [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1480.3999999999999s)]
*  no like ownership stake over what happens in this country. And you're just going to wake up one day [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1484.72s)]
*  and we're going to be doing not 99% Hitler, but 100% Hitler. And you're going to be like, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1490.48s)]
*  how did this happen? Okay, that's it. I'm not having a conversation about harm reduction right [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1495.28s)]
*  now. Okay, yes, Trump will make things exponentially worse. I know he already is making things [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1501.36s)]
*  exponentially worse and he's not even the president right now. Why what I demand, what I demand from [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1506.3999999999999s)]
*  the counterbalance to that is an adequate defense against like racial animus that the Trump [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1512.3999999999999s)]
*  Republicans are running on right now. You want to give us some intel? I checked. Dude, dude, dude, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1518.8s)]
*  Biden is president. Like we had four years of the Democratic establishment running the show and [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1527.2s)]
*  that's when the abortion rights were taken away. Okay, how do you not see that like the machine is [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1532.6399999999999s)]
*  spinning in this direction? Where they are openly being like, listen, it's a big temp party, but [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1538.72s)]
*  you're not in it. Okay, you're not in the tent. What are you going to do? Not vote for us? Suck [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1543.52s)]
*  my that's basically the opinion that the Democratic Party has in terms of like, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1547.84s)]
*  people who are just like, please fight back against it. What are you doing? [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1552.8799999999999s)]
*  January 6, your vehicle was allowed to kind of pass the Bible. We've seen no I was in the building [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1557.4399999999998s)]
*  you in the building. I've never said that it wouldn't be good for Trump to lose. By the way, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1563.1999999999998s)]
*  you are making a point that I've never made. I despise Donald Trump. Okay, you are trying to [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1568.24s)]
*  actively make a point that I'm not making, because you don't want to address the point that I am [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1575.2s)]
*  making. You're sidestepping the actual point. And instead, focusing on a thing that I never said. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1580.8s)]
*  Okay, that's it. That's not what I'm talking about right now. Also, that's why I always reiterate to [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1587.28s)]
*  all the liberals in the chat. Don't worry, Kamala Harris most likely is going to win anyway. Okay, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1593.04s)]
*  because the Trump campaign is objectively bad, like they're running a bad campaign. They are not [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1598.56s)]
*  doing a good job. Okay. They're doing a really bad job. Trump losing and conservatives being less [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1605.1200000000001s)]
*  would actually be really good for minorities. I'm sorry, but it's crazy to say it wouldn't be good [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1610.88s)]
*  for him to lose is idiotic. I never said that. Okay. Lift people up and not beat people down so [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1614.16s)]
*  they feel alone and are made to feel small and made to feel like they're somehow [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1620.16s)]
*  not a part of it or us. Madam Vice President, thank you so much for your time. Thank you. Thank [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1625.52s)]
*  you. I've appreciated it. Thank you. Thank you. Anyway, like the one here, I'll tell you this much. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1632.72s)]
*  In terms of her like scared posture. Listen, as a Hassan contracted RFK brain worm, what are you [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1639.6000000000001s)]

*  wow. Great point, man. Thanks. So true. A song. Great point. What is happening? Are you the one [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1652.0s)]
*  with the brain run? All you were doing is just asking Democrats to be more proactive on progressive [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1656.3200000000002s)]
*  issues and appropriately combat talking points. I don't know how this is so hard for some chatters [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1660.4s)]
*  to understand because American politics, unfortunately, okay. The reality is American politics [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1664.0800000000002s)]
*  is ultimately a game of team sportsmanship. There is no real like material change happening. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1672.24s)]
*  The only thing you can hope is the expectation that like you maybe push the actual pain four [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1680.4s)]
*  years down the line. Okay, that's it. So the people that are hyper focused on politics [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1687.92s)]
*  are all are almost always going to are almost always going to talk about like the minor [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1694.0s)]
*  differences in between either party, because it's just ultimately powerless. Like you're not vote, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1700.48s)]
*  not a single person in this chat is voting for Kamala Harris, because they think that like the [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1706.88s)]
*  $50,000 in tax cuts that she will offer to startups is phenomenal. And that's like what [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1714.0800000000002s)]

*  reason. They are voting against Donald Trump. They are voting against the Republican Party. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1725.2s)]
*  Okay, this puts the Democratic Party on unstable ground. Okay, you cannot always run against the [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1731.36s)]
*  Republicans, you have to run or you have to run for things if you want to win decisively, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1741.9199999999998s)]

*  so frustrated about Kamala Harris being, you know, a serial under performer, or being legitimately, [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1754.88s)]
*  like genuinely bad on certain issues is at the behest of the Democratic Party launching a [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1763.3600000000001s)]
*  convincing program, okay, launching a convincing narrative against the Republicans. And it's not [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1770.48s)]
*  even it's not necessarily just that I want them to do this because there is also a positive for [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efed-qP8ynk&t=1779.28s)]
