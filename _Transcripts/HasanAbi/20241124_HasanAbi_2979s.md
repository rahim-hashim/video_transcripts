# Online Gambling Is Dangerous | Hasanabi Reacts to Drew Gooden
**HasanAbi:** [November 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s)
*  If I'm being honest, I think this was actually best case scenario for me. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=0.0s)]
*  I consider myself lucky that the few times I've tried gambling, it has. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=3.5s)]
*  I low key think this is exactly what happened to me too. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=7.54s)]
*  First year that I'm working at the young Turks, I get a graduation present of, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=10.78s)]
*  I believe $2,000. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=16.78s)]
*  If I'm not rem, if I'm not misremembering from an uncle of mine, not jank. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=18.48s)]
*  Alright, let's do online gambling. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=30.9s)]
*  To celebrate my friend's birthday, I went on a victory casino cruise. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=32.5s)]
*  And not only did everyone get seasick almost immediately, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=36.5s)]
*  but we also lost all the money we brought in to gamble with. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=39.6s)]
*  It was one of the best days of my life. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=43.0s)]
*  For a good portion of the past century, getting on a boat that reeks of piss [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=44.7s)]
*  and wobbling your way out just far enough into the ocean so that laws don't exist anymore, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=48.3s)]
*  was one of the only ways to legally gamble in the United States. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  It had such a convoluted barrier of entry that most people could go their entire lives [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=57.2s)]
*  without ever being tempted to do it. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=62.2s)]
*  Just don't go to Nevada and you'll probably never see a casino. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=64.2s)]
*  In 2024, this is no longer the case. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=67.8s)]
*  This shit is so bad, bro. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=76.0s)]
*  I keep, I keep talking about this and I know like, and I say this is someone who has gambled himself, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=77.7s)]
*  like who, you know, enjoys the process for sure. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=82.9s)]
*  But this shit is so fucking bad, dude. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=86.8s)]
*  You say Polymarket? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=91.2s)]
*  Yes, as you guys know, I am such an anti-gambling crusader that I said no to Polymarket, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=92.2s)]
*  offering me one million fucking dollars as a starting point to the negotiations to, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=96.7s)]
*  to, to fund my election day, my election day stream, my election day broadcast. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=104.5s)]
*  Like that was their entry point in the conversation. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=111.0s)]
*  Like as in, you know, they start with a million, we say two, and then we move on from there type shit. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=113.3s)]
*  Having said that, while I understand the entertainment value of gambling [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=118.8s)]
*  and as, and have participated in the act myself, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=122.6s)]
*  I think that there needs to be safeguards and we just do not have it at all. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=126.39999999999999s)]
*  And it's gotten worse and worse and worse as time has passed. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=131.9s)]
*  And I don't know, not gonna lie, I hate gambling, but I still would have taken it [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=136.7s)]
*  because it's such a life-changing amount. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=140.4s)]
*  Brother, I have more money than I know what to do with it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=141.7s)]
*  And also I have editorial independence. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=144.5s)]
*  That's actually not true. I still, you know, I get to waste it on causes that I care about, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=147.2s)]
*  spending on shit that I care about, people that I care about. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=153.0s)]
*  But also besides the point, like I said, I have subscribers. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=156.0s)]
*  I have you, so it doesn't really matter. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=159.2s)]
*  It was also one of the funniest ways in which, you know, I, not only did I never really entertain it, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=165.7s)]
*  but it's so funny because if I did, I might have actually gotten like involved in this f****** FBI raid. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=171.6s)]
*  It's so funny that my morals have kept me out of these weird predicaments over and over again. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=179.9s)]
*  Taking that deal with immediately undermine yourself. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=188.1s)]
*  Yes, 100%. Bruno Korea, they give it the five, give the subs. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=190.2s)]
*  Next time they ask you about sponsors, refer them to me. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=194.29999999999998s)]
*  I got it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=197.1s)]
*  Ori Hope. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=198.1s)]
*  I'll be like, hey, Polymarket, listen, I know you want to give me a million dollars as a starting point, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=200.1s)]
*  but I'll have you know, there's a chatter in here that's willing to take that million dollars off of your hands instead. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=205.29999999999998s)]
*  I worked in casino industry for 10 years and I hate online slash mobile gambling. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=212.1s)]
*  The casinos in my state have to contribute to the problem. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=214.89999999999998s)]
*  Gambling programs. Oh, have to contribute to problem gambling programs and provide information on how to reach out to them. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=217.6s)]
*  Players also have the option to borrow themselves on the properties if it gets too bad. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=221.89999999999998s)]
*  Online spaces rarely have these resources. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=225.2s)]
*  Yeah, and shit is still fucked up even at that point. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=227.3s)]
*  Okay, like things are bad even in that point because for a lot of people, especially as time passes, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=230.20000000000002s)]
*  especially as especially as like people's living circumstances worsen, people unironically think like this is how I'm going to make money. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=236.0s)]
*  Like they legitimately think they're going to make money gambling. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=244.5s)]
*  It is so fucking stupid. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=246.9s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=248.8s)]
*  Do you thinking Mr. B's gambles? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=249.9s)]
*  I know he does. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=251.5s)]
*  He gambles like crazy, but that's not why he's rich. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=252.3s)]
*  You crazy. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=255.20000000000002s)]
*  Chatters gambling only works in one direction. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=256.2s)]
*  Okay, and no you do not make money gambling. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=259.5s)]
*  You lose money gambling. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=263.3s)]
*  That's it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=264.4s)]
*  Which is why I remember you talking about refusing Saudi money when you were still broke. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=265.9s)]
*  True way back when when I was broke as fuck Kingdom of Saudi Arabia reached out to my manager, not even my current manager, my former former manager. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=270.4s)]
*  When I was at the Young Turks, I just started doing Twitch streams and I was like, no, I don't want to do that. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=279.59999999999997s)]
*  Good amount of money. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=285.9s)]
*  Anyway, let's keep going. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=287.29999999999995s)]
*  Your family's never been broke, but people say broke. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=291.79999999999995s)]
*  What? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=294.9s)]
*  Bro has a thousand hot dogs. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=295.79999999999995s)]
*  He'd offer 10,000 hot dogs says no, I am not golden. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=297.09999999999997s)]
*  Your family's never been broke, but people say broke when they mean they don't personally make money, but real broke ain't nothing like that. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=300.4s)]
*  First of all, no, there was definitely a time when I was definitely that 100% was broke. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=307.09999999999997s)]
*  What the fuck are you talking about? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=311.29999999999995s)]
*  Also, what are we doing broke Olympics? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=312.59999999999997s)]
*  Like what the fuck? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=314.29999999999995s)]
*  Oh, I'm sorry. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=315.1s)]
*  Yet. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=315.70000000000005s)]
*  My family wasn't like homeless if that's what you mean. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=316.0s)]
*  Like, yeah. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=318.70000000000005s)]
*  Also the point that you just said is exactly what I was saying. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=320.5s)]
*  I said, I personally said I have a thousand hot dogs, which is why, you know, when I get offered 10,000 hot dogs, I say no, that's that was my point. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=324.1s)]
*  You're reiterating my point back to me, which is what is odd. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=333.8s)]
*  Like I'm I literally personally said that of course it is much easier for me to say no to shit. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=336.90000000000003s)]
*  Even though most people would never say no to it. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=342.6s)]
*  That's the point. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=344.4s)]
*  Oh, you don't understand the thing is your dad was a billionaire that had to flee Turkey. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=345.29999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, that's always funny. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=347.9s)]
*  I take care of my parents chat and I'm very proud to do so and part of that is because of all the people that subscribe for sure. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=349.29999999999995s)]
*  Like that's how I'm able to do it. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=356.2s)]
*  But you know, my dad's a billionaire. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=357.59999999999997s)]
*  If you watch any sports at all ads for sports betting have become inescapable. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=361.29999999999995s)]
*  Even if you muted every commercial and closed your eyes until the game came back on it's still plastered everywhere. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=365.79999999999995s)]
*  DraftKings promos pop up in the middle of a play. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=372.0s)]
*  There's bet MGM billboards behind home plate and dual logos on the court on the microphone. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=375.2s)]
*  They come at you from every angle pepper spraying you in the face. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=381.1s)]
*  So you don't notice they just pulled your pants down. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=384.2s)]
*  They've made it so watching sports and betting on sports are just two sides of the same coin. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=386.4s)]
*  Like you can't have one without the other. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=391.6s)]
*  It's become so normalized that it might be easy to forget that gambling can be kind of bad actually about 10 million people in the US alone [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=393.5s)]
*  struggle with gambling in some way a good portion of which are under the age of 25 gambling addicts attempt suicide at a rate 15 times higher than the general population. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=401.9s)]
*  The average debt of a gambling addict can range from 15,000 to $90,000. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=410.9s)]
*  But where most people would see this as a problem a few people saw it as an opportunity all that extra money that could be siphoned from struggling families and into the pockets of like 12 CEOs. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=415.7s)]
*  And we're not doing that because so in 2018 the Supreme Court overruled the federal ban on sports betting and since then Americans have collectively lost over 245 billion dollars on it. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=426.90000000000003s)]
*  That's almost a thousand dollars per person and that number was from last year. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=440.20000000000005s)]
*  But the bombardment of playful advertising filled with famous celebrities would make you think it's just a harmless fun game. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=445.1s)]
*  Kevin Hart, Post Malone, Chris Rock, LeBron James, Kevin Hart, Peyton Manning, Jamie Foxx, Eric Andre, Patton Oswalt, Vanessa Hudgens, the guy from that Kendrick Lamar song, Kevin Hart. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=452.4s)]
*  Even the Talk To A podcast is sponsored by Better. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=464.29999999999995s)]
*  Why is it always the people you trust the most? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=467.29999999999995s)]
*  Dude, that's crazy. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=479.29999999999995s)]
*  That's so gross. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=481.4s)]
*  Like, yeah, you don't even know all about sports, baby. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=483.2s)]
*  Just put your money in and you'll make more. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=487.5s)]
*  Just bet stupid. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=491.5s)]
*  What's wrong with you? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=494.29999999999995s)]
*  It's good. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=496.2s)]
*  It makes you feel good. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=497.4s)]
*  Ooh, a bold way to advertise your product. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=499.9s)]
*  You don't have to know anything about sports in order to bet on them. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=504.09999999999997s)]
*  In fact, we would prefer you didn't. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=507.2s)]
*  Look, this guy's just chilling in a hot tub. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=509.2s)]
*  He doesn't even know what sport he bet on and he won money. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=511.0s)]
*  So go ahead, just open the app and start mashing buttons. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=514.2s)]
*  I don't know, like, where do you think they got all the money to shell out to these celebrities? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=517.5s)]
*  Could it be that maybe prize picks isn't the secret gateway to riches beyond my wildest imaginations? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=521.8s)]
*  And maybe they're just trying to get my debit card number so they can take all my disposable income. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=528.1s)]
*  Whether or not you think sports betting should be illegal, and I'm not even necessarily saying it should be, the fact that they're allowed to advertise it like this is f***ing insane. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=531.7s)]
*  Imagine a cigarette commercial that was like, oh my God, this is so good. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=540.7s)]
*  This is the best I've ever felt in my life. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=545.7s)]
*  I'm on top of the world. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=548.1s)]
*  Typically the only tobacco ads you see are like anti-vaping PSAs. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=549.8000000000001s)]
*  And I hope there's a future where advertising for betting apps is regulated in a similar way. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=554.2s)]
*  You can still bet on sports. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=559.2s)]
*  You can still smoke cigarettes if you want to. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=560.5s)]

*  They offered me a... [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=621.8000000000001s)]
*  I think it was $800,000 for a poker. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=622.7s)]
*  Streaming, I was like, no, I'm good. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=626.1s)]
*  Yeah, bitch. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=627.6s)]
*  Six years since the federal ban on sportsbooks was overturned, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=629.3000000000001s)]
*  technology has already evolved well beyond what was available at the time. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=632.7s)]
*  And now the gambling has gone from being in a place you have to go to to do it, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=636.8000000000001s)]
*  to being accessible on your phone at any moment. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=641.2s)]
*  There's nothing stopping these apps from trying to lure you in constantly, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=644.2s)]
*  and they're really good at doing that. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=648.0s)]
*  Addiction is intensified, he says, by how much the gambling companies know about each user. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=649.7s)]
*  That data was used to tailor offers and push notifications to keep the guy in action. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=654.9s)]
*  They knew the life state, the customer life stage he was at, so win back, they described it. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=659.8s)]
*  So people that have given up gambling for a while, and they're trying to get them to come back. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=663.6999999999999s)]
*  Just by using these apps, you're giving them data about your gambling habits, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=667.4s)]
*  which they can then weaponize against you. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=671.3s)]
*  If they realize around 2 p.m. every Sunday is when you're most likely to interact with the app [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=673.5s)]
*  because you're watching 19 games at once and you're starting to get a little restless, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=677.6s)]
*  they can tailor make a push notification just for you. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=680.6s)]
*  Maybe they'll boost the odds of a third quarter Tyreek Hill touchdown, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=683.4s)]
*  or they'll show you a parlay that 50,000 other people have bet on, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=687.3s)]
*  and that many people can't all be wrong. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=690.9s)]
*  Let's talk about parlays for a second, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=692.6999999999999s)]
*  because I think that's one of the biggest contributors to the exponential rise of sports betting. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=694.1s)]
*  It's parlay time. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=698.0s)]
*  Put simply, a parlay is when you combine multiple bets into one bet, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=699.0s)]
*  significantly decreasing the odds of it hitting, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=702.6s)]
*  but massively boosting the payout you'll win if it does. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=704.9s)]
*  It's basically the difference between winning a few dollars for correctly calling one coin flip, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=707.4s)]
*  or winning thousands of dollars if you can get that coin to land on heads 12 times in a row. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=711.6s)]
*  You're so distracted by the possibility of how much you could win [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=716.3000000000001s)]
*  that you're not even considering the fact that you definitely won't. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=719.3000000000001s)]
*  Parlays are the lottery ticket of sports betting, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=722.2s)]
*  and these apps have made it so easy to make one whenever you want. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=724.4s)]
*  The only thing stopping you from putting together a parlay [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=727.8000000000001s)]
*  that frankly doesn't even make sense is your own imagination. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=730.3000000000001s)]
*  Because of parlays, I think for a lot of people gambling has become death by a thousand paper cuts. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=733.5s)]
*  Maybe instead of losing a lot of money all at once, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=738.2s)]
*  you're just losing a little bit of money all the time. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=740.8s)]
*  Sometimes you'll even lose money in a way that feels like you almost won. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=743.5s)]
*  Ah, five out of six. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=746.8s)]
*  I was so close, but that means I'll definitely win next time. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=748.0999999999999s)]
*  My only personal experience with online sports betting was a couple years ago [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=751.6999999999999s)]
*  when I saw Underdog Fantasy was offering to match your first deposit up to $100, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=755.0s)]
*  and I thought, okay, I'll give it a try. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=759.5s)]
*  I watch a lot of football. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=761.1999999999999s)]
*  Maybe I can finally make back some of the money I've spent over the years supporting my stupid shitty team. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=762.1999999999999s)]
*  So I put in a hundred bucks. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=766.5s)]
*  They doubled it. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=767.5999999999999s)]
*  And slowly, over the course of the next two months, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=768.1999999999999s)]
*  I lost $25 every week until it was all gone. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=770.4s)]
*  Now, if I'm being honest, I think this was actually best case scenario for me. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=773.6s)]
*  I consider myself lucky that the few times I've tried gambling, it ha- [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=777.1999999999999s)]
*  I low-key think this is exactly what happened to me too. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=781.1999999999999s)]
*  First year that I'm working at the Young Turks, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=784.5s)]

*  I lost it all on Blackjack. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=834.9s)]
*  I love Blackjack. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=836.6s)]
*  I still play Blackjack. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=837.7s)]
*  Okay? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=839.6s)]
*  At the age of 22, I lost it all and it broke me. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=840.2s)]
*  It broke me. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=844.9s)]
*  And I played by the book too. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=846.7s)]
*  It's not like I was fucking around, but I was insanely unlucky. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=848.0s)]
*  Now listen, that was the moment where I was like, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=851.5s)]
*  damn, this shit fucking sucks. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=855.1999999999999s)]
*  Now I look back at that fondly because if I did not have that experience, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=859.8s)]
*  if I had actually turned around and made that $2,000 into $4,000, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=864.5s)]
*  I probably wouldn't be here right now. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=868.5999999999999s)]
*  I'd be on Kick.tv, baby. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=869.8s)]
*  Whoo! [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=871.9s)]
*  Hanging out with Drizzy Drake. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=873.0999999999999s)]
*  Let's fucking go. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=875.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=877.9s)]
*  Come on. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=879.5s)]
*  Everybody gets to be rich. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=881.0s)]
*  Come on. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=882.1999999999999s)]
*  Don't get it twisted. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=883.9s)]
*  Honestly, straight up. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=885.3s)]
*  I think at that point it was just like so devastating to have so much money, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=886.9s)]
*  more money than I know what to do with. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=890.7s)]
*  Okay? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=893.4s)]
*  At the age of 22, I'm 33 now, but at the age of 22, 23, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=894.2s)]
*  I'm fucking sitting there staring at $2,000 and then it peepee poofs. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=900.3s)]
*  Okay? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=905.2s)]
*  It perishes. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=905.6s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=907.0s)]
*  When I tell you how fucking devastated I was, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=909.7s)]
*  that I had done this like insanely stupid thing. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=913.5s)]
*  Okay? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=917.8s)]
*  Now I'm talking about not taking on $800,000 for fucking playing poker [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=918.4s)]
*  for an hour. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=924.9s)]
*  And I guess, you know, it's because I don't want you to also go down that fucking round [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=925.8s)]
*  and potentially go in the opposite direction. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=930.2s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=931.8s)]
*  Was your uncle mad at you, Lamau? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=932.8s)]
*  I never told him. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=934.2s)]
*  Okay, man? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=935.2s)]
*  I never told anybody. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=936.2s)]
*  The shame I felt in that moment was that I was so pissed off. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=937.4s)]
*  I felt in that moment is instrumentals. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=942.2s)]
*  Casinos don't actually make money off of serial gamblers who spend $25 here and there. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=946.9000000000001s)]
*  That stuff is good. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=953.8000000000001s)]
*  But the way casinos actually make money is off of whales. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=954.9000000000001s)]
*  Okay? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=958.7s)]
*  And you can become a whale by just being rich and not giving a shit and, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=960.0s)]
*  you know, not giving shit about like losing $250,000 over a weekend or whatever. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=965.2s)]
*  Or you can become a whale by losing everything. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=969.8s)]
*  Okay? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=974.4s)]
*  Basically not having $250,000 and losing it regardless. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=975.6s)]
*  So that's how casinos actually make their money. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=979.5s)]
*  And what they're doing with the $100 giveaway is to basically see, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=982.3s)]
*  because everyone has some nascent gambling addiction, like addictive attitudes, right? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=987.9s)]
*  They're trying to figure out who is the gambling addict. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=993.1s)]
*  And they're trying to basically cast as wide an end as possible to just create new lifelong gambling addicts. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=995.9s)]
*  They'll lure you in with an offer that seems too good to be true, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1004.6999999999999s)]
*  because all of that is pennies compared to what they're raking in from the people who are hooked. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1007.6s)]
*  They give you free money to start with. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1011.5s)]
*  They'll let you try again if your first bet doesn't work. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1013.1999999999999s)]
*  They'll let you throw in one leg of a parlay that has essentially a 100% chance of hitting. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1015.6999999999999s)]
*  They are desperate to make sure you have a good time. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1020.4s)]
*  They want every time you see that app icon on your phone to think about the rush you felt when you turned $5 into $100. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1022.8s)]
*  This is also very important. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1029.5s)]
*  The way the gambling addiction works is not actually about winning money, necessarily. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1030.6s)]
*  That's a good way to draw you in originally. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1034.3s)]
*  But the dopamine hit you get is actually from the moment of like finding out whether you won or you lost. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1036.5s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1042.1s)]
*  So you still have that dopamine receptor tickled every time you lose. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1043.0s)]
*  Because it's not about winning or losing. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1047.8s)]
*  It's the high that you reach at the point of anticipation. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1049.3s)]
*  It's the buildup and the revelation. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1052.7s)]
*  That is what gambling addiction is all about. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1055.2s)]
*  100. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1058.7s)]
*  So you keep chasing that feeling forever. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1059.2s)]
*  I just managed to outsmart them by being so unbelievably bad at sports betting that I never even came close to winning. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1061.5s)]
*  But because I was curious to see how much online sports gambling has evolved since I tried it a couple years ago, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1068.7s)]
*  and because I would never leave a stone unturned in the pursuit of research, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1073.7s)]
*  I decided for this video I should try it one more time. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1076.8999999999999s)]
*  So I signed up for the only legal sports book in my home state of Florida, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1079.5s)]
*  which I assume is named after famous internet sex symbol Hard Rock Nick. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1082.6s)]
*  Balls tugged on one by one. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1086.6s)]
*  Their introductory offer is that they'll give you another chance to bet if your first one doesn't win. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1088.5s)]
*  On the surface, that almost sounds like free money, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1093.5s)]
*  but it's not like you can bet once, lose, and then just take your money back. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1096.0s)]
*  You still have to give them the money. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1100.3999999999999s)]
*  You're probably just going to lose twice for the price of one. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1102.3999999999999s)]
*  But hey, check this out. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1104.7s)]
*  I've already unlocked a 1x multiplier, which means for every dollar I earn, I walk away with one dollar. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1106.1s)]
*  I spent the next 12 minutes hard at work, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1113.2s)]
*  concocting the smartest and most guaranteed parlays the world has ever seen. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1115.9s)]
*  With all my bets placed, I could finally sit back, relax, and enjoy a stress-free Sunday afternoon. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1121.0s)]
*  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1127.1s)]
*  Why did I bet on Sam Darnold? [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1129.3s)]
*  Why did I bet on Kirk Cousins? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1131.0s)]
*  Why did I take the over on Curtis Martin rushing yards? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1132.5s)]
*  He retired in 2007. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1135.5s)]
*  The next few hours felt like a roller coaster, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1137.0s)]
*  but in spite of it all, I was determined to come out on top. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1139.6s)]
*  Guess who has two thumbs and just won $9.52? [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1143.4s)]
*  This guy. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1148.4s)]
*  My other thumb's holding the phone. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1149.9s)]
*  I was down but now I'm up. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1151.5s)]
*  And since I only lost five other bets, I was just $61 from breaking even. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1154.0s)]
*  Now I know what you're thinking. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1158.8s)]
*  Drew, how could you have possibly known the bills were going to beat a team significantly worse than them? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1159.7s)]
*  What are you, some kind of genius? [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1164.7s)]
*  No. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1166.2s)]
*  I prefer savant. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1167.2s)]
*  The truth is, none of this would have been possible without my good luck charm, Michael McCorkle Jones. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1168.7s)]
*  You can look it up. That's his real name. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1174.2s)]
*  Ever since I saw him hit the gritty at the Pro Bowl a few years ago, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1175.9s)]
*  I knew I needed a metal poster of him to hang up on my wall. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1179.2s)]
*  And thanks to today's sponsor, Displate, that's finally possible. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1182.5s)]
*  Are you tired of waking up to your boring, empty walls? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1185.0s)]
*  You tried to hang up posters, but your hammer didn't come with instructions, so you don't know how to use it. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1188.4s)]
*  Well, why don't you go ahead and throw that thing in the trash? [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1193.3s)]
*  Because you don't need one to hang up a Displate. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1195.8s)]
*  Displates are high-quality metal posters that help you show off all your favorite interests, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1197.8s)]
*  whether it's Elden Ring, Halo 3, or a minion from the movie Minions. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1201.5s)]
*  And the best part is you can hang them up in a matter of seconds without any tools and without putting any holes in your walls. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1205.3s)]
*  Displate has over two million artworks to choose from, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1210.5s)]

*  They've even got a product called Textra that brings your posters to life with tactile textures and 3D contours. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1218.7s)]
*  Finally, a poster that's fun to touch. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1224.2s)]
*  If you've been procrastinating your holiday shopping, there's never been a better time to snag a Displate. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1226.5s)]
*  Not only are they great gifts for anyone in your life, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1230.4s)]
*  but they're celebrating Black Friday with their biggest discount of the year. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1232.2s)]

*  Thank you so much to Displate for sponsoring today's video, which unfortunately will now continue. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1242.1000000000001s)]
*  All right, so I've been using this app for a little over a week now, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1246.1s)]
*  and even though I did win a few more bets, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1248.8s)]
*  all I've really managed to do is turn my initial $100 into zero. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1251.6999999999998s)]
*  It's all gone. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1257.3s)]
*  I think they know they're on the verge of losing me. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1258.3s)]
*  Really ramping up the notifications. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1260.8s)]
*  Most days, I'm getting at least one every hour. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1263.1s)]
*  They even offered me another second chance bet, this time up to $500. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1266.5s)]
*  They are so confident, based on everything I've shown them so far, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1271.5s)]
*  that it seems they're willing to give me any amount of money, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1275.0s)]
*  because it doesn't matter. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1277.8s)]
*  I'm just going to lose it all anyway. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1279.1s)]
*  Even in my very limited time using this app, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1281.1s)]
*  I can already see the traps they're setting for me, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1284.0s)]
*  and I am falling for them. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1286.6s)]
*  For some reason, I've done multiple parlays that are contingent upon something happening at the beginning of a game. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1288.4s)]
*  They offer a bunch of bets that are based on first quarter stats, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1294.8s)]
*  and I realized firsthand why they do this. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1298.2s)]
*  Because that one leg can cook your entire parlay immediately. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1300.8s)]
*  But at that point, you've already committed to betting on this game, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1304.4s)]
*  and there's so much more game to bet on. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1307.4s)]
*  So you do. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1309.9s)]
*  And before you know it, you're betting on Keishon George to make five threes? [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1310.9s)]
*  Why did I do that? [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1315.4s)]
*  I don't even know who that is. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1316.9s)]
*  Why did I think Jake Paul was going to knock out Mike Tyson? [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1318.2s)]
*  That fight was never ending, and in a knockout, they punched each other like four times. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1321.7s)]
*  Obviously, they were just in it for the money, and I knew that going into it. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1325.8000000000002s)]
*  I only did this bet because they boosted my odds, and they only- [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1330.0s)]
*  I think it's also actually crazy that you can bet on stuff like the Jake Paul-Mike-Tyson fight, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1333.8s)]
*  which I think is like, you know, it's cooked already from the start. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1341.3s)]
*  Like, that was a scam to begin with. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1345.1999999999998s)]
*  The problem is like, we gamble on Twitch on dumbass bullshit that happens on the stream. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1347.8s)]
*  The difference, however, is that that dumbass bullshit is, you know, has no bearing on the real world, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1352.8999999999999s)]
*  and it also is betted on with fake points. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1358.3999999999999s)]
*  Like, it doesn't do anything. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1362.6s)]
*  We don't use real money. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1364.0s)]
*  So, I don't know. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1365.3s)]
*  I just think it's ridiculous that this is so commonplace. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1366.3999999999999s)]
*  Only boosted my odds because they knew it wasn't going to happen anyway. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1371.1999999999998s)]
*  It's 2024. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1374.8999999999999s)]
*  How am I still getting scammed by Jake Paul? [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1376.5s)]
*  And on the flip side, when I do win a bet, sometimes I'm not even that happy about it [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1378.8s)]
*  because I'm just like, ugh, I should have bet more. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1383.6s)]
*  You start getting carried away doing the math. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1385.6999999999998s)]
*  I turned $10 into $30, but I could have turned $100 into $300, $1,000 into $3,000. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1388.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1394.4s)]
*  It's infinite money. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1395.5s)]
*  And I think that's one of the most dangerous things about gambling, is that sometimes it works. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1396.6s)]
*  It's a hobby that technically could go well for you if you get very lucky and quit at the exact right time, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1401.4s)]
*  which you won't, and the casinos are banking on the fact that you won't. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1408.6s)]
*  Problem gamblers aren't just chasing a feeling. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1412.2s)]
*  They're chasing this idea that maybe they'll win the lottery. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1414.7s)]
*  A lot of gamblers can recognize that they have a problem, but see the problem as the way out of the problem. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1417.6s)]
*  I think the feeling at the time was, if you can just get lucky here somewhere, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1424.3s)]
*  then potentially there's a way of making this all go away. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1428.3999999999999s)]
*  I suppose the flip side to that as well, Aaron, is it was enabling me to just gamble as much as I wanted as well. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1432.1999999999998s)]
*  If I just have one good day, I can win it all back. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1436.6s)]
*  Yes, I've dug this huge hole for myself, but if I just keep digging, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1439.6s)]
*  I might be able to find that diamond I've been desperately searching for. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1443.6s)]
*  But the sad reality is, even if you find the diamond, you're just going to feel so good doing it [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1447.2s)]
*  that you'll probably dive right back into the mines looking for another one. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1452.8s)]
*  The truth is, if I'd have had that big win, I would have just spent it anywhere. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1456.2s)]
*  A lot of the higher-ups at these companies will refuse any responsibility for creating new gambling addicts over the past few years. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1459.8s)]
*  They'll make the argument that they're just addicted to their phone, and our app just happens to be on it. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1467.6000000000001s)]
*  I don't believe that there is an addiction to mobile betting any more than there is an addiction to utilization of your phone for any other reason. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1473.8s)]
*  You don't think adding a layer of betting makes the phone more addictive than just tooling around Instagram? [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1481.8s)]
*  No, there is problem gambling. It is a real problem. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1487.3999999999999s)]
*  Whether it's gotten bigger or it's just become more noticeable because sports betting is legal, I think is an unknown. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1491.0s)]
*  No, it's not. Demon, dude. Demonic. Demonic. This shit is crazy. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1500.4s)]
*  Hey, they'd be gambling anyway. Whether it's on our app that sends 30 push notifications a day and is linked to their bank account [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1507.4s)]
*  or only available in a state on the other side of the country is totally irrelevant. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1515.4s)]
*  And while there are obviously some people for whom that is true, you cannot deny the fact that making it so goddamn easy [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1519.4s)]
*  to bet anything at any time is leading to more people gambling who wouldn't have otherwise. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1527.8000000000002s)]
*  Your dangle and explode in popularity at almost any point of any day. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1533.8000000000002s)]
*  You can go to the slots tab on kick.com and see someone who is zonked out of their mind. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1538.8000000000002s)]
*  Eyes bloodshot red 12 hours into nonstop slot spins, desperately trying to win back all the money. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1544.8000000000002s)]
*  Oh my God. Oh my God. They're using he's using togy. The absolute. Oh my God. The absolute best possible. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1552.2s)]
*  The absolute best possible example of a person who's like destroyed their lives. Yeah, I know they're talking about cake. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1561.2s)]
*  You got to rewind. No, I know. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1567.2s)]
*  Every aspect of our lives only gives more power to those with influence. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1569.2s)]
*  It creates a financial incentive for spreading deliberate misinformation. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1573.2s)]
*  It can make you question the motive behind everything you see and hear. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1577.6000000000001s)]
*  But on the other hand, XQC lost seven hundred thousand dollars betting on the election. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1581.6000000000001s)]
*  And that's really fun. If you don't know who XQC is, he's a streamer who, at least in every clip I've seen of him, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1587.6000000000001s)]
*  seems to be speaking a language he invented and no one else can understand. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1593.6000000000001s)]
*  Game government and no one in the mass sample. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1597.6000000000001s)]
*  What do I do with that? [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1600.6000000000001s)]
*  What do I do with that? I was also one of the many streamers who've massively increased their wealth over the past few years [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1603.0s)]
*  by taking sponsorships from offshore crypto based online casinos, helping them and the website they stream. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1609.0s)]
*  Yeah, I gave up. I don't know how to fucking I don't know how to translate that one. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1616.0s)]
*  It on explode in popularity at almost any point of any day. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1620.0s)]
*  You can go to the slots tab on kick dot com and see someone who is zonked out of their mind. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1624.0s)]
*  Look at Togi's wall behind him. I wonder I wonder how that happened, dude. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1631.4s)]
*  XQC's Canadian boomhouser. I mean, it makes sense. He's he is from level. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1635.4s)]
*  Oh, Jesus Christ. My Jews are doing these slots are worse than the sports gambling stuff. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1640.4s)]
*  I don't like sports gambling either. But yes, the slots are demonstrably worse than the sports. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1646.4s)]
*  The sports gambling stuff. I am in no way, shape or form promoting sports gambling when I say this. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1651.4s)]
*  I'm not saying that sports gambling is bad, but like sports gambling has there are limiters that are in place for sports gambling. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1657.8000000000002s)]
*  Like, if you know what the fuck you're doing, you can actually leverage your bets in a way where you can always make money. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1664.8000000000002s)]
*  And if the actual bookies figure out that you're doing that, they can just stop you from gambling. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1669.8000000000002s)]
*  Like there is a thing in sports gambling where if you're actually too good at gambling, the casino just stops you. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1676.8000000000002s)]
*  Also, same with fucking counting cards, actually. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1684.2s)]
*  But if you're too good at blackjack, the casino can legally just stop you from entering the casino, which is crazy. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1688.2s)]
*  Like, how are you at that point? It's like you need to understand. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1697.2s)]
*  Like, no, man, the shit is stacked against you. Okay, they don't want you to win. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1700.2s)]
*  It's like it's basically illegal for you to win consistently. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1704.2s)]
*  They come up and kindly tell you don't come back here. We know what you're doing anyway. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1709.2s)]
*  That's not how it works with sports betting, bro. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1712.6000000000001s)]
*  How does it work with sports betting? You're going to you're going to explain to me what I just explained and using different different words instead. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1715.6000000000001s)]
*  And then you're going to act like we have a serious disagreement. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1723.6000000000001s)]
*  They usually just stop you from playing blackjack, but we'll still let you lose money on other games. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1727.6000000000001s)]
*  Well, yeah, the point is, the sports betting is still unpredictable, obviously, and I don't recommend it at all. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1731.6000000000001s)]
*  And I never said that like the average person can successfully gamify it. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1739.0s)]
*  But even those who are capable of doing that still get clapped. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1744.0s)]
*  And ultimately, ultimately, it's still gambling and it's still bad. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1749.0s)]
*  It's bad for your health. It's bad for your brain chemistry. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1753.0s)]
*  I think it makes you it makes you just it causes you to not enjoy anything. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1756.0s)]
*  Well, you just keep chasing that fucking high that you get from hoping that I will play the fucking stupid ass Korean dating sim that everyone wants me to play and keep writing in the chat over and over again. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1761.4s)]
*  Maybe I'm chasing this high. It's not even about the Korean dating stream at all. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1775.4s)]
*  It's more so on me being annoying in the chat and just writing it in the chat with the hopes that the uncertainty is what keeps you going. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1780.4s)]
*  Is he going to play today? Is he not going to play today? [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1789.8000000000002s)]

*  Shut the fuck up. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1792.8000000000002s)]
*  Guys, bloodshot red 12 hours into nonstop slot spins desperately trying to win back all the money they've lost so far. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1794.8000000000002s)]
*  Oftentimes in a situation so dire that even the chat with no personal stakes involved and only there for entertainment is begging them to stop. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1801.8000000000002s)]
*  But they can't. They're on autopilot. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1810.8000000000002s)]
*  Every loss is money that needs to be won back and every win is just more money to gamble with. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1812.8000000000002s)]
*  I randomly opened this guy's stream one day and watched in real time as he won almost $100,000 and then say this. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1817.8s)]
*  95k! That's fucking huge. We're a tenth of the way back. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1827.2s)]
*  A tenth? This dude was down a million dollars on Big Bass Bash? [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1830.2s)]
*  To most people watching, it's pretty easy to say, hey man, you should probably quit while you're ahead. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1837.2s)]
*  No, a hundred thousand isn't a million, but it's a lot more than zero. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1842.2s)]
*  The problem is someone in this state of mind isn't capable of seeing it that way. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1847.6000000000001s)]
*  He's not even in Thursday afternoon with the rest of us. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1851.6000000000001s)]
*  He's still on the tail end of Wednesday night. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1854.6000000000001s)]
*  So the rational part of his brain, too subdued to muster anything more than a mumble, asks his chat if he should end it there. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1856.6000000000001s)]
*  Who's that guy? He's Togi. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1863.6000000000001s)]
*  He is the number one steroid influencer for the youth. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1865.6000000000001s)]
*  Gotten many a youthful minds, deeply and helplessly addicted. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1870.0s)]
*  AdiQ. He's very funny, but he's also a fucking massive degen. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1876.0s)]
*  We have the better leaves. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1881.0s)]
*  But there's nothing he can do to stop the momentum. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1900.0s)]
*  I have to quit at a certain point. I have to give up. At a certain point I gotta give up. Oh my God. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1903.0s)]
*  At a certain point I gotta give up. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1908.0s)]
*  Dude, that dog demolished the balance. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1910.0s)]
*  Oh my God. That's crazy. Lost over a million dollars today. There's nothing in there. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1913.0s)]
*  All he can do now is sit in the reality of what just happened. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1920.0s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1924.4s)]
*  Beautiful girl. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1925.4s)]
*  Dude. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1926.4s)]
*  Come to terms with the fact that despite his and everyone else's better judgment, he got doghoused. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1927.4s)]
*  Doghouse is what did it. Doghouse is what defeated me. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1933.4s)]
*  I got doghouse. I got doghouse. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1937.4s)]
*  I got a full doghouse. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1940.4s)]

*  Dude. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1947.4s)]

*  Keno, listen. Cinema. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1949.4s)]
*  Okay. I'm sorry. It's perfect. It's perfect. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1952.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1956.8000000000002s)]

*  I don't know, actually. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1960.8000000000002s)]
*  The thing is, it's hard to take streams like this at face value. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1962.8000000000002s)]
*  There's a very well-documented history of streamers on kick, high stakes gambling, with money that was given to them by the website they're playing on. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1965.8000000000002s)]
*  So not only are the stakes not high, but it's technically not even gambling. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1974.8000000000002s)]
*  It's just promotion. The entire goal of these streams is just to make the people watch. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1978.8s)]
*  Wasn't there like a lot of drama surrounding this? [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1982.8s)]
*  I think like even Trane was accusing the website of of like changing the not only giving money to certain gamblers, certain gambling streamers, but also like changing the outcome of the gamble itself to get like these massive fucking wins. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=1984.8s)]
*  Juicing the juicer. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2002.2s)]
*  Charlie Kirk is a legend for that. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2003.8s)]
*  Who's fucking who are we watching? [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2005.6s)]
*  Someone in the chat said Charlie Kirk is a legend. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2008.6s)]
*  Yeah, they just hate Trumpo. Trump's a cunt. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2011.0s)]
*  Charlie Kirk has been known so many times on all these all those sit downs. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2013.3999999999999s)]
*  Trump's fucked and he's just going to blame cheating. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2016.6s)]
*  I'd rather deadass vote for Biden senile ass over Kamala. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2018.8s)]
*  Bro, stop talking about Trump. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2022.3999999999999s)]
*  Stick to your specialty of black cocks. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2023.8s)]
*  I'm not gonna lie, dude. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2026.1999999999998s)]
*  I shelter you so much from how fucking awful how insanely awful the rest of the online space is. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2027.3999999999999s)]
*  Like if you if your only interaction if your only interaction revolves around just like being here with like the streaming space, you have a very very different understanding of how this shit looks. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2036.8s)]
*  Watching them think they too can go win life changing money on ask coin dot com all bullshit. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2051.2s)]
*  Maybe the only real thing about these streams are the holes he punched into the wall behind. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2057.2s)]
*  Maybe he'll miraculously be back in a couple days. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2061.9s)]
*  That's why you should think twice before shitting on the mods. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2064.8s)]
*  The suspiciously large balance after seeming to lose everything. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2067.0s)]
*  But clips like this are just the flip side of an online ecosystem currently doing everything it can to convince impressionable teenagers scrolling through tick tock and YouTube shorts that gambling is awesome. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2070.8s)]
*  Actually, and you got to start doing it. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2081.9s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes, yes. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2084.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2085.2000000000003s)]

*  That's a great feeling. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2089.0s)]
*  Now some people have accused these websites of rigging the odds in favor of this dude. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2092.6s)]
*  My favorite. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2098.8s)]
*  My favorite was Nick Murs talking about how shitty Call of Duty is and how fraudulent Call of Duty is while he was gambling on like Rubit or something. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2099.6s)]
*  He was like just no self-awareness whatsoever. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2111.8s)]
*  He is just sitting there being like Call of Duty is fraudulent. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2116.8s)]
*  Okay, it's fucked up is fraudulent and fucked up. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2120.5s)]
*  It's a bad game. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2124.4s)]
*  Nobody should play it. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2125.4s)]
*  That's why I gamble. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2126.8s)]
*  You'll never guess what XQC is doing right now. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2128.9s)]

*  Here it is. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2133.0s)]
*  Here's one aspect of his hangout session with Drake. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2134.1000000000004s)]
*  This is XQC real streaming legend me. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2136.8s)]

*  I'm so corny. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2157.8s)]
*  He's just like dude. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2159.5s)]
*  You are a quintillionaire dude. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2161.1s)]
*  I mean you guys both have so much money. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2164.0s)]
*  It just doesn't make sense why you would literally on top of the fucking piles of gold that you have you're like. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2166.6s)]
*  Working at the behest of a crypto casino like working at the behest of a crypto casino where your goal is to get other people to be your goal is to get other people to just like fucking also gamble their life away people that have so much less than you. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2175.7s)]
*  I will never understand it. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2190.2s)]
*  What's Drake going to do when he's at the Super Bowl and the entire stadium calls him a pedophile? [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2191.5s)]
*  I don't think he's going to the Super Bowl. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2194.9s)]
*  This explains XQC's behavior. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2196.5s)]
*  Wait, this is the Laval flag for real. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2198.7999999999997s)]
*  That's kind of cool though. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2202.0s)]
*  I mean it's weird but unexpectedly cool. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2203.4s)]
*  It's easier for them to farm these clips and as far as I'm aware, there's no proof of that. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2206.8s)]
*  I think the misrepresentation of odds here is simply due to the fact that these websites can just keep depositing money into their accounts whenever they lose giving them unlimited funds to play with. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2211.3s)]
*  Unless Ruba is going to give me free money. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2222.2000000000003s)]
*  I think that's like actually it really just need a highway to give us a ton of free money. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2224.1s)]
*  If you're given infinite money, you can just keep betting until you hit a jackpot. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2228.3s)]
*  For them, there's no such thing as rock bottom. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2233.6000000000004s)]
*  A philosophy that very much does not translate to real life. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2236.0s)]
*  In real life, you can hit. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2239.8s)]

*  It's going to be tough to take these creators seriously when Call of Duty is their main thing and only thing is hard to take their opinion is bond when they're being paid in one way or another. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2250.7000000000003s)]
*  It's going to be really tough to take any of these creators seriously, especially like like swag Tim any type of like Call of Duty primary creators like like duties on the room bed, dude. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2257.6s)]

*  What are you saying? [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2273.1s)]
*  Like when when when Call of Duty is their main thing and their only thing, it's hard to take their opinion as as bond because look, they're they're being paid in some way or the other. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2274.4s)]

*  It's always the same shit. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2327.9s)]
*  It's the same shit. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2329.9s)]
*  Is it not like every Call of Duty? [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2331.2999999999997s)]
*  They all say it's going to be the best year the biggest year. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2333.0s)]
*  This is going to be crazy. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2336.5s)]
*  I came back from the last Call of Duty thing and I said that the game was going to be good. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2337.5s)]
*  But I didn't say anything close to what these other motherfuckers were saying. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2343.2999999999997s)]
*  Oh, he's like I was doing it too. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2346.2s)]
*  It's funny because he's not wrong as far as like Call of Duty just bringing out the same fucking slop year over year. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2348.1s)]
*  It's just funny because he's also admitting to doing it back when they also had his skin saying, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2356.2999999999997s)]
*  I mean, they are all the best Call of Duty, their best war zone for zones back. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2361.3999999999996s)]
*  I'm like, what? [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2364.7s)]
*  And I mean, I showed that Call of Duty next. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2366.2999999999997s)]
*  I took over man. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2368.0s)]
*  We got the first win. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2368.8999999999996s)]
*  I mean, it was a fucking party, you know, but that was when we were full swing playing Apex. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2371.2s)]
*  I'm hoping for a good day for Call of Duty. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2376.7999999999997s)]
*  You know, I really fuck him. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2378.6s)]
*  I just think it's really the juxtaposition gets me. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2380.2999999999997s)]
*  It rock bottom and when you do there's no texting Howie to get yourself out of it. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2383.2999999999997s)]
*  What's especially concerning about these kinds of streams is that while sports betting apps are at least targeting mostly grown man, [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2387.7s)]
*  the majority audience for a lot of these streamers are teenagers and young adults. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2395.2999999999997s)]
*  People whose brains have not finished developing yet people who would have a harder time distinguishing between entertainment [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2399.7s)]
*  and real life and have less of an ability to evaluate risk compared to people much older than them. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2406.3999999999996s)]
*  It is statistically proven that people who are exposed to gambling at a young age are more likely to develop problems with it later in life. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2411.7999999999997s)]
*  So maybe don't do this. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2419.2999999999997s)]
*  Is that too much to ask? [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2422.1s)]
*  Now there are a few different types of gambling stream. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2423.2999999999997s)]
*  The answer is yes. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2425.3999999999996s)]
*  I did do this and and and I will tell you okay as someone who did do this for quite a long time. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2427.6s)]
*  I made some very wealthy enemies. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2435.8s)]
*  Okay, very very wealthy and increasingly less popular but at the time very popular enemies and let me tell you. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2438.5s)]
*  Okay, their fans were not happy. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2448.3s)]
*  Okay, they were not happy at all. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2451.1s)]
*  And you know, it's definitely definitely a continued fire hose of hate that I receive regularly. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2454.3s)]
*  There are the ones like Aiden Ross who have been very transparent about the fact that money is the only thing that matters to them [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2464.1000000000004s)]
*  and there's no line they would be unwilling to cross in pursuit of it. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2471.1000000000004s)]
*  Then there's streamers like Steve will do it who admitted in an interview with coffeezilla that the only reason he started taking these [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2474.3s)]
*  was because he used to have a gambling problem and it was a way for him to continue to gamble without having to use his own money. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2482.1s)]
*  In other words, he knows from personal experience the harm a gambling addiction can cause but he has no problem promoting that to other people [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2490.1s)]
*  as long as it's not his money they're losing. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2498.1s)]
*  But then there's also plenty of streamers that don't seem to think they're doing anything wrong. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2500.2999999999997s)]
*  They put their head in the sand and make excuses because the money's too good for them to turn down. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2504.9s)]
*  Take Nick Merckx for example, Nick gets pretty defensive when people question the fact that he spends one week out of every month spinning slots on kick.com. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2509.3s)]
*  Oh yeah, man. Sorry. Forgot a bunch of children watch my stream. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2517.9s)]
*  Like dude, you spent the past six years streaming Fortnite and Call of Duty. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2521.5s)]
*  If you don't think the majority of your audience is young men, I don't know what to tell you. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2526.3s)]
*  And don't even- [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2531.1000000000004s)]
*  Okay, I'm gonna defend Nick Merckx here. I feel like his audience is both young men and also divorced cops. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2531.7000000000003s)]
*  Okay. I think he probably has a decent amount of, you know, divorce cops that are in his audience as well. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2538.3s)]
*  Still a lot of still a lot of young men there too, but I was about to fucking freak out on you. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2544.3s)]
*  Wait, what? A lot of divorce cops. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2549.5s)]
*  You're gonna get me started on Drake. I know a large port- [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2553.3s)]
*  Take Nick Merckx for defunding the police by directly, directly taking, directly giving cops a lifetime of crippling gambling debt. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2556.1000000000004s)]
*  Okay, my man is doing wonders. A lot of you guys say, A-Cab, Nick Merckx is living it. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2566.3s)]
*  Okay, do you understand? Not many of you do the praxis. You just read the theory. Nick Merckx out there doing the praxis. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2572.7000000000003s)]
*  Chill, chill on Nick Merckx, okay? [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2580.3s)]
*  A portion of his audience is underage because those are the people he's trying to fuck. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2582.5s)]
*  So while obviously these websites who use decentralized currency and are based out of a small island country with laughably loose gambling restrictions in order to skirt federal regulations [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2586.1000000000004s)]
*  are mostly to blame for the damage they've caused. These celebrities and streamers who've helped popularize them are very much complicit. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2595.3s)]
*  When you build an audience online, whether you like it or not, there is a parasocial element. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2602.5s)]
*  Like that's the thing I don't understand. Like I guess is a matter of gamifying the situation, but it's like, [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2607.9s)]
*  what's the difference between making 50 million dollars and making 150 million dollars? [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2612.7000000000003s)]
*  Okay, people like, you've already maxed out dude. You've won. Okay, you have fuck you money. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2618.7000000000003s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like what like what? Why? Why? Like, what do you need? [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2625.1s)]
*  Like at that point, the difference is basically there is basically you either get one Bugatti or fucking 10 Bugattis. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2630.7s)]
*  What are you going to do? What are you going to do with 10 Bugattis? [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2640.7s)]
*  You can only drive one at a time. Who cares? [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2643.5s)]
*  I just I don't know. Maybe they're saving up the Biosports team Lamount. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2646.1s)]
*  No, because other rich people make them feel poor. So they never feel is enough. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2649.7s)]
*  I just I don't know. I don't understand it. You can drive two very carefully. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2654.3s)]
*  I think a lot for a lot of people is just like gamifying making money. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2659.5s)]
*  I think that's what it is. I think it's just like bigger number more, you know, more win more victory. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2664.7000000000003s)]
*  I genuinely feel like for a lot of people. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2671.3s)]
*  It's just about it was just about the feeling of like winning more. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2673.9s)]
*  It has to be sounds like something someone with nine Bugattis would say. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2677.9s)]
*  I know my broke ass with my nine Bugattis. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2681.4s)]
*  To it there are people in your fan base who look up to you and trust you and every time you sell something to them. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2683.7s)]
*  You are leveraging that parasocial relationship in order to financially benefit and I'm not gonna act like I'm perfect. I sell merch. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2689.6s)]
*  I have sponsors. I just did an ad read like three minutes ago, but my god. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2695.8999999999996s)]
*  I feel like the bare minimum with the sponsorship is does this product actively hurt the people that use it? [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2699.5s)]
*  Yes, then I'm not gonna do that. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2706.54s)]
*  I get that it can sting to turn down a lot of money and if the numbers people have floated around are accurate. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2709.2s)]
*  It is a stupid amount of money. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2715.2999999999997s)]
*  But for some of these people who could already live 10 full lifetimes without ever having to worry about bills ever again. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2717.0s)]
*  When is it enough? It's just great. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2724.3999999999996s)]
*  I mean the hundred million also is because he is gambling. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2726.2s)]
*  That's the reality. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2729.1s)]
*  Well, you would not have been a hundred mil contract if it wasn't for gambling. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2730.5s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2733.7s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2735.1000000000004s)]
*  Easy to me. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2737.1000000000004s)]
*  It's like thank you to everyone who supports what I do. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2737.7000000000003s)]
*  You've given me my dream job this life of luxury. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2740.8s)]
*  I'm so lucky to have and in return I give to you a crippling addiction. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2743.8s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2749.6000000000004s)]
*  I wanted to buy a house in Mexico. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2750.1000000000004s)]
*  We got another place because you can't do it in America. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2751.5s)]
*  You have to go somewhere else. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2754.0s)]
*  So we went somewhere else and we got another place. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2755.3s)]
*  Call me dramatic, but I'm a little concerned where this is all headed. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2758.0s)]
*  People like to talk about iPad. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2761.1000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2762.5s)]
*  Drew cooked on this like big time. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2763.6s)]
*  Okay, big time cook. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2766.1s)]
*  Babies who are burning all their dopamine receptors before they even reach preschool. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2767.8s)]
*  But what is a slot machine if not just a giant iPad? [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2771.6s)]
*  Scientifically engineered to be as mesmerizing as possible. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2774.3s)]
*  So you don't even realize what you're letting it take from you. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2777.5s)]
*  Thousand dollars in fast spins at $50 a spin. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2779.9s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2782.4s)]
*  $194,000 grand. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2782.7s)]
*  That thing is due. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2785.0s)]
*  Well, that's a thousand dollars. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2786.8s)]
*  Gambling can be addictive enough on its own even before you add in all this social pressure. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2787.9s)]
*  The transition from casual gambler to full-blown addict can happen so gradually. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2792.3s)]
*  A lot of people don't even realize it's happened to them until it's too late. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2797.2000000000003s)]
*  And when everyone around you from celebrities and commercials to all your favorite streamers [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2800.7000000000003s)]
*  are just making it seem like it's no big deal. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2806.3s)]
*  It's fun. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2808.5s)]
*  Everybody does it. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2809.2000000000003s)]
*  Can you truly recognize the seriousness of what you're getting yourself into? [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2810.2000000000003s)]
*  I think all we can really do for the time being is try to fight back against the normalization of gambling. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2814.1000000000004s)]
*  So what do you say we all get together and call a timeout? [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2819.7s)]
*  So how does this change your views on LeBron being complicit in promoting gambling? [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2823.2s)]
*  Are you ready to declare Michael Jordan the goat yet? [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2826.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2829.2999999999997s)]
*  Famously, Michael Jordan hates gambling. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2830.2999999999997s)]
*  He's done a lot of anti gambling initiatives. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2834.3999999999996s)]
*  Google Michael Jordan gambling for more information. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2836.6s)]
*  Out. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2839.8999999999996s)]
*  What's that? [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2840.7s)]
*  They already tried that for hate. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2842.0s)]
*  We need to stop it. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2843.0s)]
*  So let's take this moment. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2844.6s)]
*  To change the momentum. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2846.0s)]
*  And call a timeout. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2847.1s)]
*  On Shades. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2847.8999999999996s)]
*  Together. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2848.5s)]
*  And it's not working. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2849.8999999999996s)]
*  Even though they got Shaq. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2851.7s)]
*  Well, that's not good. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2852.6s)]
*  That's kind of the only idea I had. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2853.6s)]
*  Gambling is not new. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2855.3999999999996s)]
*  For as long as there's been man, there's been the primal desire to bet it all on red. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2856.7999999999997s)]
*  But what is new is the way technology has evolved to prey on these urges in the most efficient and targeted ways possible. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2861.3999999999996s)]
*  Using AI to send push notifications at the precise moment they know they're most likely to be open. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2867.7s)]
*  Using a constantly evolving algorithm to offer bets that are so time sensitive, [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2873.0s)]
*  you have to commit to it before you even have a chance to think about it. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2877.6s)]
*  These apps didn't invent gambling addiction. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2880.4s)]
*  They've just made it more accessible. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2882.5s)]
*  You combine all of that with a system in which most people aren't paid nearly enough money for the amount of work that they do [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2884.1s)]
*  and might see gambling as one of the only ways out of that situation only to end up exacerbating their problems. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2888.9s)]
*  And you end up with the unmitigated economic disaster we're in now. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2894.4s)]
*  Forgive me for using the c-word, [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2897.9s)]
*  but we stumbled into this stage of capitalism where every dollar must be profited by any means necessary [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2899.2s)]
*  and forgoing any chance to do so would simply be seen as a missed opportunity. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2904.7999999999997s)]
*  Advertisements in between the game? [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2908.8999999999996s)]
*  Not enough. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2911.0s)]
*  No, they're a part of the game. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2911.7999999999997s)]
*  A mini fridge in the hotel that I can store my leftovers in? [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2913.0s)]
*  No, we should be filling every square inch of that thing with $12 Coke cans [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2915.7s)]
*  that'll automatically charge your credit card even if you're just moving one out of the way. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2919.5s)]
*  A YouTube outro that's just a few seconds of peaceful music and no call to action? [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2922.7999999999997s)]
*  You wish, bozo. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2926.3999999999996s)]
*  Please go listen to the song I made with my friend Sam. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2927.5s)]
*  I wrote the guitar for it and I think it's pretty good. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2929.6s)]
*  Thanks for watching. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2931.7s)]
*  What a great video. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2934.7999999999997s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2936.1s)]
*  No notes. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2937.1s)]
*  Like I said, I am a person who enjoys the act of gambling. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2939.0s)]
*  Okay, I do. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2944.2999999999997s)]
*  It's not like the best experience overall, but the way I see it, [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2946.7999999999997s)]
*  I have a host and I get a lot of freebies and I try to at least gamble away the amount. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2952.2s)]
*  Whatever the actual amount of those freebies would look like. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2960.2s)]
*  Free rooms, free entertainment, that sort of shit for myself and my family. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2963.2s)]
*  And I want to show them a good time. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2967.6s)]
*  And but even with all of that, like I just think that there needs to be severe restrictions [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2969.1s)]
*  on being able to do it, you know, geo locking it to a certain degree. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnG6fhEZ00s&t=2974.7999999999997s)]
