# Hasan's PSA Episode Hits #1 On The Charts | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [November 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM)
*  Am I doing any podcasts while I'm in England? I don't know. I don't know if I have the time. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=0.0s)]
*  A bunch of people have reached out to do stuff, but I'm pretty, I'm, I'm in and out in England [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=5.86s)]
*  and I'm going to be constantly moving. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=11.72s)]
*  PSA is the number one episode at the moment. Wait, what? This is the number one episode [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=14.24s)]
*  right now, bro. What is happening, bro? They bro. My podcast on pod save America is right [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=27.08s)]
*  now the number one episode I saw, bro. I saw this. I saw the, the, the pots of America [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=34.839999999999996s)]
*  episode already passed. I saw the pod save America episode that we did already passed [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=41.16s)]
*  the one that they did with the, with the consultants, which I thought was really funny because it's [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  like, this is objectively a more important, more newsworthy episode. This is the first [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=52.04s)]
*  time that they like the Kamala Harris campaign. This is the first time that the Kamala Harris [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=58.76s)]
*  campaign has actually like been on the record defending their own positions and doing a [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=63.4s)]
*  spectacularly bad job at it. But like the fact that my episode with jump Favreau past [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=69.28s)]
*  there, that episode is insane to me already in one day. But yeah, honestly, like I said, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=77.0s)]

*  Okay, hold on. If you would have shown me at the DNC Kamala would have won maybe. Yeah. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=126.12s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. I should have, I should have just like shown me beforehand. Also today [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=131.48000000000002s)]

*  killed that, but someone bought merge to give away to random chatter. So we can give away [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=216.84s)]
*  for that one. Now you want to do that now or a bit later. I don't know how to do that. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=221.24s)]
*  Like I don't know. Do I, you guys can, can you guys handle it? I don't know. Like, I [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=225.36s)]
*  don't know how to do that. Okay. You got control over it. All right. You, you do it then. Yeah. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=229.84s)]
*  People, people can also gift. I don't exactly fully understand how that works, but like [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=234.32000000000002s)]

*  Thanksgiving. So far. I've heard that some people do Thanksgiving on Friday as well. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=329.84s)]
*  Like they do a both on they do it on Thursday and they do it on Friday. That's what I've [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=335.11999999999995s)]
*  heard. I've heard some people just doing that. Especially if they have like, you know, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=339.47999999999996s)]
*  like divorce families or whatever. But for me one day is enough. You know, I'm back to [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=343.08s)]
*  business baby. We're done. Okay, where are you going? Kaia? What is what the hell? That's [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=347.23999999999995s)]
*  crazy. She's acting brand new. She's like LA Times is here. I can do what I want. I'm [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=355.16s)]
*  queen. I'm the queen. They're continuing to pump out your pod save clips. Keep up the [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=359.96000000000004s)]
*  good work. Yeah, hell yeah. For every single person, including the people that voted for [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=364.44s)]
*  Donald Trump. One of the funniest aspects of the tariffs conversation that's happening [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=369.24s)]
*  right now is that Donald Trump is going to implement broad tariffs on 45% of all trade [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=372.64000000000004s)]
*  that comes in and out of the United States of America, Mexico, Canada and China comprise [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=378.48s)]
*  of all trade. He wants the tariff every single one. Tariffs are obviously an entry fee that [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=384.23999999999995s)]
*  the American corporations are going to be paying. None of the countries are going to [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=388.59999999999997s)]
*  be paying for these tariffs. It's a policy that's going to destroy drop shippers, which [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=391.44s)]
*  overwhelmingly vote for Donald Trump and the Trump merchandise industry. So that's pretty [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=395.91999999999996s)]
*  funny. But having said that, it's going to be devastating for the economy. Now, what [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=400.88s)]
*  do I think Trump will do in the process? He'll obviously use tariffs to basically get corporations [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=405.55999999999995s)]
*  and industries and sector leaders on board with his agenda. So when he says jump, they [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=410.8s)]
*  say how high or I'm going to slap you with tariffs and it's going to actually punish [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=415.32s)]
*  you. It's going to hurt your bottom line. And I think that's part of the reason why [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=419.2s)]
*  they're going to do that. The other reason is a regressive tax is a broad sales tax on [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=423.12s)]
*  all consumers that disproportionately affects the working poor. And we're hoping he's loved [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=427.32s)]
*  that shit. He also at times, I think, will just institute the Defense Production Act [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=431.40000000000003s)]
*  or something like we'll see it. We kind of saw it in COVID as well when it was a necessity. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=436.76s)]
*  But that's the thing. The American government is powerful. All governments are powerful, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=440.76s)]
*  but the American government is especially powerful. It's the wealthiest nation on the [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=444.96s)]
*  planet. And the way that it runs is basically it's like 50 companies in a trench coat. We [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=448.92s)]
*  are working at the behest of corporations. We feed them with our tax dollars that turn [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=454.5s)]
*  into subsidies for them. They utilize those subsidies to, I guess, lower production costs. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=458.96s)]
*  But then they use that to increase their profit margins and engage in what used to be illegal [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=463.71999999999997s)]
*  pre Ronald Reagan, you know, stock buybacks and the like market manipulation of all different [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=469.55999999999995s)]
*  sorts. And we're constantly deregulating the economy. It's not just about having a populist [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=473.52s)]
*  message. It's about actually implementing said populist message and show who your real [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=478.91999999999996s)]
*  enemies are. Am I doing any podcasts while I'm in England? I don't know. I don't know if I [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=482.79999999999995s)]
*  have the time. A bunch of people have reached out to do stuff, but I'm pretty I'm I'm in and [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=488.55999999999995s)]
*  out in England and I'm going to be constantly moving. So there's a lot to figure out. Alex [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=493.44s)]
*  Connor. I would potentially do one with him. I just don't know how I would even reach out to [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=500.24s)]
*  him. Honestly, I don't know. Like what was his name? Cosmic skeptic, right? Is that what it is? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=506.4s)]
*  Yeah, I have no, I have no way of reaching him. So come to your son, please. Are you live [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=511.76s)]
*  from your talks in the UK? Yes, I'm planning on doing that. Yes. Too accurate. What is this? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=517.36s)]
*  Grandma, you're looking lovely tonight. Look, you guys. Look, you guys. I just think health [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=523.92s)]
*  care is a universal right? Cousin John, you're a fascist and the revolution will not spare you. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=528.56s)]
*  Yeah. What's the occasion in the UK? Don't worry about it. Do you want to do giveaways at set time [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=532.64s)]
*  so it doesn't interrupt? Also let chat know also zero D B P won the last giveaway. Congratulations [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=537.12s)]
*  of zero D B P. No, but on there, it is my mom. Are you debating Jordan Peterson? Finally? No. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=544.88s)]
*  Come to slow is beautiful. This time of year. That sounds like that sounds awful. That sounds [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=551.2s)]
*  like an awful place. You know what it reminds me of? Where did I go? I went to Birmingham. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=556.88s)]
*  No, not Birmingham. Where did I go? That was like, so it was like, it was at Birmingham. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=563.28s)]
*  It was like one mall. That's the only thing they had there. And I didn't even go to the [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=568.24s)]
*  mall. No, not Brighton. Brighton is fine. I think it was. It was, I think, Birmingham. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=572.88s)]
*  Brighton was all right. It's just like everything is so gray in the UK and [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=577.84s)]
*  Brighton's like, come see our beaches. We've got nice beaches and then they have no beaches. Like [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=582.4s)]
*  it's crazy. Anyway, yet more anti Scottish by not visiting there. Yeah. Birmingham is great fellow. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=587.52s)]
*  Brew me. Nice. Only UK frogs are chirping. What's wrong with Brighton man? What the no, I said [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=594.4s)]
*  Brighton is nice. Tubbo. I gotta hit you up to ask for advice on how to live stream these [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=602.24s)]
*  two events that I have where like, I don't know. I need your, I need your expertise on this. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr40eM3E2lM&t=609.6s)]
