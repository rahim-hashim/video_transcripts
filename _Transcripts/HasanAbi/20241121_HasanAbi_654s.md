*  president like Donald Trump said it was definitely social issues like trans rights and immigration [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XaKDr0ToOQ&t=632.64s)]
*  that made them support the seemingly anti-union candidate. Good luck to them. What is this? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XaKDr0ToOQ&t=636.64s)]
*  Another one. Oh, I saw this one. This is really funny to my fellow men. We all need to, I love [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XaKDr0ToOQ&t=641.52s)]
