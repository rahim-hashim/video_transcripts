# Hasan's Perspective On The Blake Lively And Justin Baldoni Drama |  HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [December 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms)
*  First of all, what views need to be reassessed though? What was the problem to be as charitable [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=0.0s)]
*  as physically humanly possible to people that are mad? It's probably because I even brought [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=5.28s)]
*  up the fact that like Blake Lively's marketing initiatives were, were, were bad. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=12.700000000000001s)]
*  Hey Hassan Abiy, I saw a thread talking about your misogynistic blind spots and biases when [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  the Blake Lively smear campaign and Justin Baldoine getting exposed to predator situation. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=29.0s)]
*  I honestly watched Caroline covering and I think you need to reassess some things, please. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=33.44s)]
*  There are fans defending you blindly thinking it's thinking of it as a personal attack on [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=36.76s)]
*  you to criticize you. I can't begin to explain to you how little I care about this. I'm going [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=40.72s)]
*  to be honest 100% like yeah, Caroline's coverage. I saw at least some parts of it was quite [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=45.64s)]
*  similar to mine, which is that like it doesn't matter what Blake Lively did. Her vibes are [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=51.76s)]
*  the is completely irrelevant to the valid claims that she made on set being made uncomfortable [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=57.44s)]
*  and the like. Didn't you not even want to cover it? I didn't. I didn't because I'm sorry, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=64.32s)]
*  but the the the highest level of mental illness is like radfem accounts that that perceive you [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=68.72s)]
*  as like someone who is secretly misogynistic who, you know, has this like dormant misogyny that [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  must be erased from your commentary. Even if the overarching point that I kept hammering on over [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=82.0s)]
*  and over again is that like Blake Lively's valid claims Blake Lively does not have to be like a [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=88.32s)]
*  perfect victim and that her vibes overall are irrelevant to the valid claims that she had made [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=95.04s)]
*  and that supercharged misogyny is being utilized by PR firms in an effort to basically vilify [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=102.64s)]
*  any woman with a valid claim in general. If you have a disagreement with that, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=109.52s)]
*  if you have a disagreement with that in any particular way, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=113.84s)]
*  because you got primed off of like a Twitter thread that you watched or a Twitter thread [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=118.24s)]
*  that you read that hyper focused on any of the instances where I've talked about Blake Lively's [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=122.24s)]
*  like bad vibes overall and not necessarily the broader point. I don't know what to tell you. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  Okay, think about it. Think about it. 80 minutes of coverage on a particular issue. I'm covering it [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=133.04s)]
*  up and down. Okay. It's relegated to a 10 tweet Twitter thread. What do you think? Do you think [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=139.44s)]
*  that this is the entirety of my coverage? Do you think that it had or do you personally think there [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=147.52s)]
*  is no reason to ever even bring up any number of different things that Blake Lively might have done [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=152.24s)]
*  because it played a formative role in the smear campaign in general responding to people in the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=158.72s)]
*  chat clips out of context? Yeah, that's true. The reason why I usually don't respond to this stuff [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=163.44s)]
*  is because I don't necessarily give a shit. It's ultimately unproductive and most people just turn [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=168.56s)]
*  around and say, well, you and then they clip my response to it to be like he's doubling down. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=173.12s)]
*  He's a misogynist, which is fine. If you want to, if you want to think that they go ahead. I mean, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=179.44s)]
*  look, if I was a misogynist, I would be an infinitely more popular person online. Let's be real. Okay. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=184.48s)]
*  It's not, I love you in this community, but please stop calling any criticism of this or like the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  herd trial of some rad fam. It's just that thread is getting blasted by people with feminism far [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=193.6s)]
*  from their chief concerns. I know it's okay. I mean, we can have disagreements. That's also [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=197.68s)]
*  another part of this issue. Like we can have disagreements on this. If you think that like [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=204.56s)]
*  the way I'm covering this stuff is bad, then yeah, you can get it elsewhere. Caroline is a much better [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  person at covering these kinds of issues. You know, I recommend Caroline's coverage on this matter [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=215.84s)]
*  rather than mine. It's also something that I just don't give a shit about overall, other than the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=222.08s)]
*  fact that, like I said, people are really leaning on pre-existing systemic biases that, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=226.56s)]
*  pre-existing systemic biases like misogyny, supercharged misogyny, in an effort to smear [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=233.76s)]
*  anyone with a valid, any woman with a valid claim. That is my overarching assessment of this [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=238.72s)]
*  situation. That's the same thing with Megan Thee Stallion as well. It's something that I have [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=243.28s)]
*  talked about quite a bit. Now, the point, the point here is this, okay? The point here is this. Do you [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=248.24s)]
*  disagree with that overarching assessment? Do you disagree with that at all? Or is it simply aesthetic? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=254.88s)]
*  Is the disagreement you have with me on my main point? Do you agree with what I'm saying? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=262.8s)]
*  Or is the disagreement my aesthetic, the way I'm covering a story? What is it? They clipped out [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=267.84s)]
*  your main points so they don't even know it. That's what I'm saying. You and Caroline literally said [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=274.0s)]
*  the same thing. This is literally just chatters who wait till you say something for it to become [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=277.36s)]
*  their opinion rather than forming one of their own. Yeah. The thread literally said you just [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=280.32s)]
*  lacked tact. The thread was all about aesthetics. Yeah. This is, I think, a weapon for me. Me lacking [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=284.16s)]
*  tact and me having jagged edges in my commentary might not come across as aesthetically pleasing [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=291.76000000000005s)]
*  to you. And it does it like, I don't know, babies being brutalized in f**king Gaza. And it's just [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=299.52000000000004s)]
*  impossible for me to do that. It's never going to happen. Okay? That's it. If you are, if you don't [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=304.72s)]
*  like the overarching way that I cover certain stories, maybe it's just not for you. Do you [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=311.04s)]
*  understand what I'm saying? I'm not going to do a performance for you is what I mean. And I'm not [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=315.76000000000005s)]
*  going to be able to change the way I cover certain things. Isn't it just another case that when you're [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=320.0s)]
*  talking about black issues, you're not talking to black chatters. When you're talking about trans [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=324.08000000000004s)]
*  issues, you aren't talking to trans people exactly. And when I'm talking about like a f**king [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=326.8s)]
*  supercharged misogyny being utilized by PR firms to vilify women, when they make valid claims, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=331.76s)]
*  like valid harassment at the workplace claims, I'm not talking to women, but it doesn't matter. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=338.4s)]
*  It is just like, it doesn't f**king matter. Everybody thinks, no, you have to serve me with [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=344.79999999999995s)]
*  the content. You know what I mean? You have to serve me. And it's like, no, it's not for you. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=349.91999999999996s)]
*  It's not for you. You are not the target. And that kind of hurts people's feelings. I think [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=355.12s)]
*  they just want me to like, change my commentary or the way I talk about certain subjects in a way [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=360.4s)]
*  that like suits your own individual aesthetic purposes. And that's not the case. Chatter saw [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=367.2s)]
*  a single Twitter thread and think you're doing PR. The Twitter thread is nothing. And if you weirdo [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=375.2s)]
*  drama freaks would stop going insane over every single bit of drama, this wouldn't even be a thing. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=379.28s)]
*  The best part are people coming out of the woodwork saying how vindicated because they always knew I [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=382.96s)]
*  was a s**t this misogynistic pig. Yeah. I mean, that's it. That's it. I should be, I should be [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=386.56s)]
*  outwoking them by saying I'm autistic. And that's why I talk about things in a blunt way. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=391.28s)]
*  And you're being ableist. You know what I mean? Hit him with that, hit him with that counter. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=396.56s)]
*  Now, having said that, does this mean I'm leaving the left? No, of course not. You know, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=401.59999999999997s)]
*  you can suck my d**k. I'm not going to change my attitude. I'm not going to change my opinion. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=406.32s)]
*  Many, many different groups from marginalized backgrounds have spoken out about the, the ways [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=410.08s)]
*  in which I cover certain topics that pertain to their own personal marginalized identity and have [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=418.55999999999995s)]
*  said that I am not good in my coverage or I'm not thoughtful in my coverage. And I think I need to [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=424.64s)]
*  hold a space for queer media in my coverage or the right. All this stuff is silly and it doesn't work [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=433.12s)]
*  and it's not going to work here. This is the package. If you don't like it, well, you don't [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=439.52s)]
*  like it. There's not really much I can do about it. So yeah, it's mainly by the reason these [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=443.76s)]
*  talking boys about Blake lively or even out there is because of the PR campaign and you reinforce [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=447.36s)]
*  the points every time you deflect to them. Okay. Once again, the main point is none of that matters. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=450.72s)]
*  Her claims are valid. None of that matters. Okay. If you can't comprehend that, I don't know what to [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=456.56s)]
*  tell you. This is not just for you. Not everyone is like, baby, is there ever a time when someone [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=462.16s)]
*  is not canceling you? Yeah. You have to remember it might not be for you. It might not be for you. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=466.08000000000004s)]
*  If you hear me say something that comes across as though it is hyper focusing on a aspect of the [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=472.88000000000005s)]
*  story that you think is wrong to hyper focus on, it might not be for you. It might be for others, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=480.48s)]
*  for example, that don't know what the is going on with the Blake lively situation. Maybe they saw [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=488.08000000000004s)]
*  the clips. Okay. And why is it on the for you page? Hmm. Yeah. Well, it is definitely for a lot of [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=492.24s)]
*  you. You just vaguely talk about rap fans and sometimes it feels like this is a term to paint [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=498.8s)]
*  all women who disagree with you. Yeah, it is. Okay. It is. That's what I'm doing is because [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=502.32s)]
*  it's not the secrets out guys. I don't like women. Okay. The secrets out this entire time, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=507.84s)]
*  this entire time I was actually trying to make the world a more tolerant space or at least the [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=515.6s)]
*  community that I have cultivated a more time space so they could inevitably make it harder for me [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=523.1999999999999s)]
*  to be misogynistic. Even though there are literally podcasts out there where the dumbest [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=529.4399999999999s)]
*  ugliest cretins on the planet could just get a sure Mike and just go women are bitches. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=536.8s)]
*  They're as they should. I hate them and get like a million views. So why the would I find a weird [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=542.8s)]
*  space for myself where I am cynically secretly in talking about talking about patriarchal constructs [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=550.9599999999999s)]
*  and things of that nature so that I can secretly turn around and make, you know, play misogyny on [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=559.68s)]
*  new game plus difficulty. Why would I do that? A question that should be on everyone's minds is [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=566.32s)]
*  that if I am this secret misogynist, why wouldn't I just be out with it? When it's literally a [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=572.24s)]
*  marketing technique, Andrew Tate straightforwardly became one of the most famous people on the planet [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=579.36s)]
*  by just doing that, just hitting that note over and over again, women are bitches. Like that's what [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=585.6s)]
*  he said over and over again. And he women are bitches his way into massive fame. Why would I [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=590.56s)]
*  do that? Okay. Women are bourgeoisie anyway, yet to get more sex. Okay. First of all, I don't need [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=596.4799999999999s)]
*  to fake. I don't need to fake male feminist myself to get sex. Okay. Your mother gives me plenty. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=604.3199999999999s)]
*  Just so you understand also more sex. How about any sex people are so funny when they hit like [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=612.0s)]
*  the 2016 lines, brother, first of all, what views need to be reassessed though? What was the problem [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=617.12s)]
*  to be as charitable as physically humanly possible to people that are mad? It's probably because [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=623.44s)]
*  I even brought up the fact that like Blake Lively's marketing initiatives were bad in general, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50KYbEtGms&t=630.8s)]
