# Biden Is Still Alive | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM)
*  The fact that this has 13,000 viewers is shocking. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=0.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=4.0s)]
*  You might say, Oh, Cory Booker got a hundred thousand. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=5.2s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=7.2s)]
*  Like, but the very fact that this has more than 10 viewers is on ironically, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=7.68s)]
*  yet another instance where I don't have a lot of, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=14.24s)]
*  I don't have a lot of faith in the democratic party's base of support. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=18.96s)]
*  We want to turn now to more news. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=22.72s)]
*  Speaking of old school, cartoonishly evil sleazeballs. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=29.84s)]
*  Here's an old school, cartoonishly incompetent geriatric man, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=32.72s)]
*  Joseph Robinette Brandon. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=36.64s)]
*  You might've forgotten about him. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=37.68s)]
*  You might've thought he was. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=39.04s)]
*  It seems he is back. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=39.76s)]
*  He is back. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=41.599999999999994s)]
*  Biden prepares for first post presidency speech. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=42.4s)]
*  This afternoon, President Biden set to make his first, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=46.08s)]
*  one of his first public appearances since leaving office. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=49.36s)]
*  He's scheduled to deliver remarks on social security in Chicago. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=52.24s)]
*  This comes as Democrats, one of the Trump administration is making cuts [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=56.400000000000006s)]
*  at the agency that provides those benefits. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  The president has repeatedly said he won't touch social security benefits. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=61.92s)]
*  So we want to bring in ABC news, political director, Avery Harper, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=65.36s)]
*  with all of this and Avery, this is an interesting first event back for president Biden. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=68.48s)]
*  Why choose this event? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=74.4s)]
*  And what do we expect him to say? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=76.32000000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=78.08s)]
*  Well, this is going to be at a conference that is for an advocacy group that is [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=79.44s)]
*  about strengthening and protecting social security. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=84.39999999999999s)]
*  We know that for Democrats, that has been a strong part of their messaging. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=87.75999999999999s)]
*  The concerns that they've. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  I really hope he says he's running. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=92.96s)]
*  He's going to run again because his job in Israel is not done. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=94.8s)]
*  This Trump guy, he didn't do enough Israel and he didn't do NATO. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=98.63999999999999s)]
*  Look alive. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=104.24s)]
*  Watch me. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=105.91999999999999s)]
*  I am alive and I'll be back. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=106.8s)]
*  I'm back again. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=111.67999999999999s)]
*  Going to protect Israel. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=112.96s)]
*  Going to protect Ukraine. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  I'll show that thug Vladimir Putin what's what. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=117.6s)]
*  I'll do NATO. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=122.96s)]
*  I'll do NATO 10 times over. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=124.8s)]
*  I'll make Ryan Routh's legacy a long lasting one. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=127.6s)]
*  I have it on good authority. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=133.44s)]
*  I got a thousand NATO trained Afghan troops ready to go in my command. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=134.72s)]
*  Took them over from my favorite supporter, Ryan Routh. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=141.44s)]
*  I guess both Trump and Biden have called the president of Ukraine a dictator for [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=144.16s)]
*  different reasons. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=150.4s)]
*  Trump, because he loves Vladimir Putin and Biden because his brain was melting [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=152.64s)]
*  and he was like president of Ukraine, Vladimir Putin. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=158.4s)]
*  I'm raised about what the Trump administration could do to social security, especially some [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=160.96s)]
*  of those concerns that there are about doge cuts, things like the possibility of office closures, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=169.76000000000002s)]
*  changes to how people have to verify themselves in order to receive their social security [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=175.44s)]
*  benefits. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=179.84s)]
*  Those are concerns that folks say could impact how people receive those benefits. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=180.8s)]
*  We expect to hear President Biden and former President Biden speak to that tonight. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=186.72s)]
*  Also interested to hear what more he might say about this current administration. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=191.51999999999998s)]
*  We know that President Trump has said a lot about former President Biden and his administration [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=196.48s)]
*  and about what it meant for the current state of this country. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=203.04s)]
*  So interested to see what he will have to say about this current administration. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=206.0s)]
*  Avery, you and I talked on the air yesterday about those events we've seen from Bernie [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=209.68s)]
*  Sanders and AOC in these events. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=213.76s)]
*  I did the nativization of Finland. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=216.32s)]
*  Man, I miss doing the Brandon voice chat. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=220.0s)]
*  Have y'all noticed? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=223.28s)]
*  I really miss doing Brandon voice. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=225.44s)]
*  It's been so long. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=227.6s)]
*  I'll do 9-11, Jack. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=228.95999999999998s)]
*  I'll do 9-11, nine times over. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=231.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's like grandpa. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=233.51999999999998s)]
*  He's going to tell us how he did August, dude. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=235.76s)]
*  I can't wait for him to talk about five eyes. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=237.92s)]
*  Watch me. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=240.79999999999998s)]
*  Events to combat what they say are quote unquote fighting oligarchy. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=241.84s)]
*  They are much younger. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=246.48000000000002s)]
*  They are fiery kinds of events. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=247.92000000000002s)]
*  You see some images there. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=249.76000000000002s)]
*  Does that stand in contrast to what we expect to see from Biden? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=252.4s)]
*  And hopefully his defense of social security is as passionate as the defense of the state [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=255.36s)]
*  of Israel. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=258.64s)]
*  Nothing will be as passionate as his defense of Israel. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=259.76s)]
*  I'm telling dude, Trump likes Israel because Sheldon and Mary Maddison give him money. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=263.84000000000003s)]
*  It's that simple. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=269.68s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=271.68s)]
*  If there was an equivalent to Sheldon and Mary Maddison that had that level of motion, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=273.2s)]
*  that level of power and was like, you are going to dismantle design as entity piece by piece. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=279.68s)]
*  Sure. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=284.72s)]
*  He wouldn't be able to go up against all of the institutional power that Israel has in [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=285.04s)]
*  the State Department interest, but he certainly wouldn't be this aggressively in favor of Israel. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=290.32s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=296.56s)]
*  Biden is a die in the wool, straight forward ultra Zionist, which is extra crazy because [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=297.52s)]
*  he's f**king Catholic, which means he out of all the Christians is the least likely [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=305.04s)]
*  to be Zionist. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=310.88s)]
*  It makes no f**king sense. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=312.24s)]
*  I will never understand the amount of the amount of support that Biden has in his heart [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=314.56s)]
*  for Israel. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=322.56s)]
*  Not true, dude. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=323.36s)]
*  Come on. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=324.48s)]
*  In comparison, Catholics, an Irish Catholic in comparison to the average American evangelical, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=325.04s)]
*  the average American evangelical outflanks Jews in Israel about what Israel should be doing. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=331.44s)]
*  Mike Huckabee is more radical in support of Israel than the average median Israeli Jewish [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=337.84000000000003s)]
*  voter in Israel. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=345.20000000000005s)]
*  This isn't to say that the average median Jewish voter in Israel is not Hitlerian in [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=346.48s)]
*  their policies. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=350.48s)]
*  It's just that's how insane Mike Huckabee is. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=351.20000000000005s)]
*  In comparison to other Christian sects, like Catholics are not supposed to be this die [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=354.88s)]
*  hard for Israel at all. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=359.92s)]
*  The Pope literally called it a f**king j**t side. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=360.88s)]
*  What are we talking about? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=362.8s)]
*  He's Irish Catholic too on top of everything else. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=364.08s)]
*  It makes no goddamn sense. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=366.24s)]
*  His faith and loyalty to Israel is insane. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=367.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=370.48s)]
*  It's real. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=371.68s)]
*  Today, again, what does it say to you about the different elements in the Democrats? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=374.64s)]
*  Well, listen, I mean, Bernie Sanders is just about the same age as President Biden, but [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=378.96s)]
*  we do see him and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez bringing out progressives across [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=384.0s)]
*  the country as they make their stop. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=391.12s)]
*  I like that they're basically saying like, yeah, he's just stealing Bernie's shtick. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=393.52s)]
*  On that tour, the last stop was in Idaho and where they brought out thousands of people [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=398.32s)]
*  to come and listen to their speech there. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=403.76s)]
*  And it's important to note that that is a state where Trump won by more than 30 points. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=405.68s)]
*  So there are people who are coming out to hear these messages. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=409.84s)]
*  I think the big question is if this could be a sustained movement. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=414.4s)]
*  A one-day event is very different than keeping people encouraged and encouraging them to [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=418.71999999999997s)]
*  come out to vote next year in midterms and beyond. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=423.59999999999997s)]
*  So we'll have to wait and see what happens there. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=426.24s)]
*  Avery Harper, my friend, thank you as always. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=428.64s)]
*  Now to President Trump's tariffs. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=431.03999999999996s)]
*  The administration taking steps to implement new tariffs on semiconductors and pharmaceuticals. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=432.64s)]
*  Our senior political correspondent, Richard Scott, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=437.44s)]
*  is at the White House with the details for us. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=439.2s)]
*  Good morning, Rachel. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=440.96s)]
*  Michael, good morning. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=442.71999999999997s)]

*  to impose new tariffs on semiconductors and on pharmaceuticals. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=447.84s)]
*  This could have a big impact on Americans across the country. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=451.59999999999997s)]
*  Semiconductors, traditionally made outside of the United States, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=454.8s)]
*  are used to power everything from cars to smartphones. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=457.76s)]
*  And on pharmaceuticals, the raw ingredients used to make most medicines are also made [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=460.71999999999997s)]
*  overseas. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=465.76s)]
*  Experts warn that could drive up the prices on over-the-counter drugs like ibuprofen. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=466.64s)]
*  But the president is insisting that all of that needs to be made here in the United States. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=471.12s)]
*  And some tech companies, including NVIDIA overnight, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=475.84s)]
*  have responded to his demand for manufacturing here in the United States. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=478.32s)]
*  But it will take time for those productions to get up at the White House, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=482.15999999999997s)]
*  the Trump administration, continuing these negotiations on trade with other countries. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=485.36s)]
*  The vice president says there is a good chance that the U.S. will reach a trade agreement [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=489.36s)]
*  with the U.K., but not at the negotiating table is China. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=493.76s)]
*  Those 145% tariffs on Chinese imports are still in place, Michael. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=497.04s)]

*  Exactly, Michael. Now, this time it is a group of small businesses that are suing the Trump [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=507.84000000000003s)]
*  administration over these tariffs, saying the president does not have the power to impose them, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=512.08s)]
*  calling his reasoning that this is a national emergency, a quote, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=517.12s)]
*  figment of his imagination. Now, the White House is pushing back insisting that. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=520.16s)]
*  Uh oh. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=524.7199999999999s)]
*  Folks, you know, it's no surprise that he did a hell of a job when I asked him to be [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=525.68s)]
*  commissioner of the Social Security. And the reason I did that is not an ordinary transition [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=531.4399999999999s)]
*  for a government. Bro, he looks so damn. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=536.7199999999999s)]
*  I mean, this is from the bottom of my heart. I mean. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=538.88s)]
*  I knew he was someone with some guts and toughness who would fight for every single penny that was, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=541.12s)]

*  Means a great deal. You're in the front lines every single day. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=560.0s)]
*  You're helping. You're advocating for your fellow Americans, Americans with disability. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=564.08s)]
*  It's a big deal. We talk about what happened in the physical side of it. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=569.6800000000001s)]
*  We didn't have some security. Think of what the psychic calm gives so many people [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=573.28s)]
*  who just don't know where to go. Don't know how to traverse what they need to be done. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=580.72s)]
*  Or alone. Last fall on the White House lawn, we celebrate the anniversary of the Americans [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=585.92s)]
*  with Disabilities Act. As United States Senator 400 years ago, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=591.6s)]
*  I was looking back on it. God almighty, I've been doing this 50 years. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=598.48s)]
*  It's held turned four years old anyway. But back in the year 1990, I was the co-sponsor [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=602.32s)]
*  of the Americans with Disabilities Act as a United States Senator. In my view, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=609.44s)]
*  and I suspect many of you, it was one of the most consequential civil rights laws [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=617.52s)]
*  in American history. That's what got me involved in politics in the first place. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=623.6s)]
*  Delaware, like Maryland, was one of those states, a slave state. We had all the vestiges of what [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=628.32s)]
*  was going on back in the day. We were one of those states that still, I remember moving from [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=633.0400000000001s)]
*  Scranton, Pennsylvania down to Wilmington, Delaware, and Cole died. My dad moved back to where he had [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=639.0400000000001s)]
*  we could get a job. I remember I pulled into my mom and driver's son in Philadelphia, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=644.32s)]
*  and she we lived in an apartment complex. And she'd drive us only about, it was only about [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=650.8800000000001s)]
*  half a mile to Holy Rosary School in Claremont. But it was so dangerous she actually wouldn't let [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=657.52s)]
*  us walk up because of Access Road. I remember pulling in, pulling into the parking lot. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=663.28s)]
*  Dude, this is crazy. I'd never seen hardly any black people in Scranton at the time when I was [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=670.4s)]
*  only going to fourth grade. And I remember seeing the kids going by at the time called colored kids [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=677.1999999999999s)]
*  on a bus going by. They never turned right to go to Claremont High School. I wondered why. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=682.96s)]
*  I asked my mom, why? So in Delaware, they're not allowed to go to school, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=687.76s)]
*  in public school, with white kids, honey. That sparked my sense of outrage of the kid, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=693.2s)]
*  just like it does, I mean, and these young kids right here can tell you things affect them when [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=699.84s)]
*  they learn about something that's really just unfair and unjust. You know, my dad, my dad was [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=704.64s)]
*  an honorable man. And my dad used to have an expression. He said, Joey, your job is about a [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=711.44s)]
*  lot more than a picture. How is he not dead yet? I don't understand. I really thought he would have [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=717.6s)]
*  been dead by now. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, honey, it's going to [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=721.5200000000001s)]
*  be okay and mean it. That's what you're all about. That's what the legislation is about. It's about [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=726.8800000000001s)]
*  dignity. Simple dignity. Everyone, everyone deserves to be treated with dignity, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=734.32s)]
*  regardless of their standard, regardless of their economic status, regardless of who they are. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=743.36s)]
*  Making sure that more than 60 million Americans who are living with disabilities are treated [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=748.96s)]
*  with dignity is who we are as Americans. That's what it's about. I mean it. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=754.24s)]
*  We're dignity at work, at school, in their communities, in every corner of American life. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=764.6400000000001s)]
*  Laws like the ADA need advocates like you. You're the ones that keep it going, God love you. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=773.2s)]
*  You fight like hell every single day to make sure the law is respected and your clients' rights are [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=779.6800000000001s)]
*  protected. So from the bottom of my heart, I mean this, I give you my word as a Biden. From the bottom [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=786.24s)]
*  of my heart, I say thank you. Thank you for what you're doing. Thank you for your commitment [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=791.52s)]
*  to the dignity of all Americans because that's what all the legislation is about. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=797.4399999999999s)]
*  Folks, today I want to talk to you about an issue that's front and center right now for millions [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=802.24s)]
*  of Americans. Social Security. You know, some of you may know the Democrats have declared today the [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=809.6s)]
*  Save Social Security National Action Day. National Day of Action, I should say. We know just how much [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=817.76s)]
*  social security matters to people's lives. Everyone in this room fights for people with [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=823.68s)]
*  disabilities who rely on social security to survive. To survive. Not just the physical side, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=829.36s)]
*  it's the mental side. It's the mental side. You make sure folks get the benefits they earn [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=836.48s)]
*  after a lifetime of hard work. The work they do is more than just a profession. What you do, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=843.12s)]
*  it's a calling. It's not just a profession. And social security is more than a government program. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=849.28s)]
*  It's a sacred promise. We made it today. A sacred promise. 73 million Americans receive social [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=855.36s)]
*  security. From the first paycheck through their entire life, they pay into social security. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=863.92s)]
*  And in return, they count on social security to be for them when they're going to need it. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=871.28s)]
*  Folks must never ever betray that trust or turn our backs on an obligation. That's why during [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=877.4399999999999s)]
*  my presidency, we protected social security and made it stronger. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=884.88s)]
*  His audio dial is busted. He just keeps yelling randomly or whispering, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=888.88s)]
*  so it's impossible to fucking regulate the audio. She referenced it. Lowest staffing levels in 50 [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=892.96s)]
*  years. And demand is going through the roof because of my generation and the baby boom generation, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=898.96s)]
*  reaching the retirement age. So the demands on social security increased significantly. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=907.28s)]
*  Our administration secured nearly $2 billion to reduce the black backlogs and improve customer [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=912.88s)]
*  service. We slashed wait times for folks in need who were calling the 1-800 number. We got it down [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=923.76s)]
*  to under 13 minutes. It used to be three times that long we took office. Made it easier for people [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=932.24s)]
*  to get help with their claims online. Reduced how long it takes to review a case. We fixed the [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=937.52s)]
*  appeal system to make it uniform in all 50 states, which made a difference. We strengthened the [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=946.3199999999999s)]
*  anti-fraud measures to protect people's identities and to make sure benefits are going to people [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=953.68s)]
*  actually they belong to. By the way, those 300-year-old folks getting that social security, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=959.52s)]
*  I want to meet them because I like to figure out how they live out. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=964.48s)]
*  A hell of a thing, man. I'm looking for longevity because it's hell when you turn 40 years old. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=968.5600000000001s)]
*  But as a result, by the time we left office, we had improved every single line of customer service [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=976.0s)]
*  from applying for disability to filing an appeal to reporting fraud. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=982.48s)]
*  It all became more efficient and more effective. And I'll bet it made your jobs easier, too, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=988.08s)]
*  in the process. Now, these achievements— [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=994.0s)]
*  —these achievements may not sound so glamorous to most people, but you know, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=997.36s)]
*  they're absolutely essential. And it might be one of the most important jobs of any elected official [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1005.52s)]
*  is to make sure the government works for the people, works for all people. It's understandable [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1012.16s)]
*  they can understand what it is. And we keep our promises to the people, to all the people. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1018.16s)]
*  That's exactly what we did, thanks to all of you. Also signed in law the Social Security Fairness [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1026.24s)]
*  Act. What's the point of this speech? Literally nothing. It's an exercise in masturbation. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1031.76s)]
*  And predictably, liberals are actually masturbating right now. The fact that this has 13,000 viewers [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1038.08s)]
*  is shocking. Okay? You might say, oh, Cory Booker got 100,000. Who cares? But the very fact that this [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1045.04s)]
*  has more than 10 viewers is unironically yet another instance where I don't have a lot of— [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1052.1599999999999s)]
*  I don't have a lot of faith in the Democratic Party's base of support. There should be more than— [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1061.68s)]
*  there shouldn't be more than a single person watching this. To be fair, you have 36,000 [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1067.28s)]
*  viewers watching it right now? Yeah, and it fucking sucks. Like— Five years and then wait around and be— [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1071.68s)]
*  I will not go further or get in trouble, but look, folks. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1081.44s)]
*  Can you imagine the cast who would have charged? Every five years, congressmen step up. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1086.4s)]
*  Can you imagine this congress stepping up? They threatened to raise the retirement age as well. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1092.3200000000002s)]
*  Now, that might not be a hardship for someone working in a comfortable job, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1099.04s)]
*  but if you're on your feet all day, you're doing manual labor all day, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1103.52s)]
*  you're working with a disability, it's a very different matter. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1108.48s)]
*  And then they even tried to face cuts— force cuts on Social Security during the negotiation of the [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1113.52s)]
*  debt ceiling. These are wonderful guys. Last time this guy had the job, he raised the debt ceiling. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1119.12s)]
*  He raised the debt ceiling because of an enormous and profligate tax cut to the super wealthy. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1127.28s)]
*  And then he said, look, then they started talking to his colleagues, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1136.32s)]
*  well, maybe we can do something about Social Security, but we got to do something about the [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1141.28s)]

*  wanted to do. They wanted to cut Social Security. Not on my watch. We refuse to go along with any of [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1150.8000000000002s)]
*  that. Look, Americans can— I've always been able to count on these benefits. And let me [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1157.6000000000001s)]
*  pause a second here and say this. We talk about the physical needs that Social Security provides [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1167.44s)]
*  for people, particularly hardworking people, people retired, people on the edge. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1175.3600000000001s)]
*  But the psychological impact is profound. Profound. You're a man or woman. You're 70s, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1180.48s)]
*  80s old. You're not in good shape. You have a disability. And you hear the check may not come. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1191.44s)]
*  How do you sleep at night? How do you sleep at night? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1202.0s)]
*  How do you sleep at night? We lived up in Wilmington, a three-bedroom, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1206.24s)]
*  split-level home in a new development, 40 homes, with four kids and a grandpa living with us. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1212.56s)]
*  And I remember my bed—our bedroom headboard was near my dad's, a mom's room. And you could tell [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1220.56s)]
*  when dad was restless. I remember asking one night, my mom, what's the matter with dad, the next [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1228.8s)]
*  morning? She has found out that they're not going to—we're not going to provide insurance [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1234.96s)]

*  You're literally counting on Social Security to buy your food just to get by. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1251.8400000000001s)]
*  And you hear the threats of what might happen. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1258.16s)]
*  Many of these beneficiaries, their only income, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1265.76s)]
*  they're a cutter taken away from being devastating, devastating for millions of people. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1269.6000000000001s)]
*  And the psychological pressure we put people under by having this debate [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1276.3200000000002s)]
*  is absolutely devastating. Okay, I got to spice this up a little bit. That's why we work so damn [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1281.76s)]
*  hard to make Social Security administration stronger than it had been in years. And that's [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1286.24s)]

*  This new administration has made so much— [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1298.32s)]
*  You'll never believe what happened in 2019. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1301.36s)]

*  Look at this. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1305.68s)]
*  It's kind of breathtaking it could happen that soon. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1306.16s)]
*  They've taken a hatchet into the Social Security administration. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1309.04s)]
*  Watch what happens at 19—on the 19th second. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1310.48s)]
*  It's coming. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1313.28s)]
*  —7,000 employees, 7,000, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1313.68s)]

*  Now they're getting ready to push thousands more out there. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1323.76s)]
*  I wonder if we can see the effects. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1328.4s)]
*  It works. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1329.76s)]
*  Causes people use the Social Security website every single day to check on their benefits [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1331.6000000000001s)]

*  What the fuck? [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1339.44s)]
*  The technology division of Social Security administration has been cut in half. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1340.8s)]

*  Just a heads up. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1382.56s)]
*  Overwhelming the phone lines. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1384.56s)]

*  No, they didn't. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1407.76s)]
*  The only time in history. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1408.48s)]
*  Yeah, this is... [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1409.28s)]
*  Social Security benefits... [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1409.8400000000001s)]
*  People are saying this is Commander. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1410.96s)]
*  Folks, let's put this in perspective. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1414.64s)]
*  In the 90 years since Franklin Roosevelt created the Social Security system, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1416.24s)]
*  people have always gotten Social Security checks. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1421.04s)]
*  They've gotten them during war time. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1424.24s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1425.92s)]
*  During recessions? [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1427.2s)]
*  During the pandemic? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1428.24s)]
*  You needed it. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1428.72s)]
*  You needed that pig tail after Biden fucking put us to sleep. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1429.3600000000001s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1433.2s)]
*  For the first time ever, that might change. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1434.0s)]
*  It would be a calamity for millions of families, millions of people. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1438.72s)]
*  But the current Secretary of Commerce doesn't seem to get it. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1445.44s)]
*  Or based on his comments, he doesn't seem to even care. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1449.44s)]
*  Many of you saw what he said the other day. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1453.2s)]
*  By the way, he's a billionaire. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1455.8400000000001s)]
*  God love him as my... [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1456.96s)]
*  Yeah, he's this ACP behind him. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1458.0800000000002s)]
*  He's the American Communist Party. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1460.48s)]
*  He's a mega communist now. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1462.24s)]
*  Billionaire is not on the East Side. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1464.64s)]
*  When he talked about the possibility of Social Security checks [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1467.68s)]
*  not going out this month, he shrugged it off. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1471.52s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1476.0s)]
*  He said his 94-year-old mother-in-law wouldn't complain, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1478.24s)]
*  wouldn't bother her. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1483.1200000000001s)]
*  She's probably a lovely woman. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1484.0s)]
*  No kidding. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1486.64s)]
*  Can you believe this guy was the president, dude? [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1487.04s)]
*  What about that 94-year-old mother living all by herself? [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1489.6000000000001s)]
*  Is there never a billionaire in the family? [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1496.08s)]
*  Or all the retirees depend on that monthly check to feed themselves? [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1498.96s)]
*  How is he still going? [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1504.4s)]
*  All those people with disabilities. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1505.2s)]
*  How is he still going? [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1506.48s)]
*  What about all those people? [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1508.64s)]
*  What about all those people? [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1509.84s)]
*  That's who you fight for. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1513.6799999999998s)]
*  So they so desperately need you. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1516.24s)]
*  Folks, it's not just the Secretary of Commerce. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1519.6s)]
*  We heard how others empowered and emboldened by this administration of Social Security. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1522.8s)]
*  One of them called a Ponzi scheme. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1529.6s)]
*  A Ponzi scheme? [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1532.56s)]
*  What the hell are they talking about? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1535.36s)]
*  People earn these benefits. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1537.9199999999998s)]
*  They paid into that benefit. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1540.08s)]
*  They rely on that benefit. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1542.6399999999999s)]
*  And no one, no one, no one should take it away. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1544.56s)]
*  You know, Franklin Roosevelt had a different view. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1552.9599999999998s)]
*  He was president coming out of the Great Depression. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1556.56s)]
*  He and all his colleagues saw great suffering, so much poverty. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1559.36s)]
*  He also took steps to raise standards of living for ordinary Americans, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1564.24s)]
*  including creating Social Security. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1568.1599999999999s)]
*  He himself was from a very wealthy family. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1572.7199999999998s)]
*  Never forget that this man's unimaginable selfishness [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1575.04s)]
*  and also insane loyalty to the state of Israel caused both a genocide to continue [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1579.12s)]
*  and subsequently his love and loyalty for Israel's endless appetite for baby murder [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1586.56s)]
*  caused Donald Trump to become the president. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1593.04s)]
*  Like, I will never forgive this demon. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1595.52s)]
*  Okay, I will never forget and I will never forgive this fucking asshole. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1599.6s)]
*  This piece of shit is directly responsible for Donald Trump and the mandate that he [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1604.3999999999999s)]
*  seemingly got, okay, to erode the due process, to shred the First Amendment, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1611.28s)]
*  to fucking engage in deportations for people who have hurt the feelings of Israel. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1618.24s)]
*  All of that, his administration set up. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1624.64s)]
*  This fucking asshole, I hope every single day that he is alive is more painful than the one prior. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1628.24s)]
*  If there was any sort of karmic justice, if there was any God, if there's any karmic justice, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1636.48s)]
*  if there's any sort of thing like that, if there was any sort of divine justice, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1642.08s)]
*  this asshole would be feeling the pain. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1646.4s)]
*  But of course, because he's fucking demented, he doesn't even get to understand [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1649.52s)]
*  what happened to his legacy. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaKg0SyfKM&t=1655.6s)]
