# A Meaningful Interview With Inmate Firefighters
**HasanAbi:** [January 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I)
*  It's kind of firefighting as an incarcerated individual, but for you guys there's a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=0.0s)]
*  There's a additional opportunity right like even if you went in as a violent [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6.32s)]
*  If you went into a juvenile facility you still have the ability to come and get training [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=10.4s)]
*  What are the benefits of? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=16.96s)]
*  doing something like this [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=18.96s)]

*  I'm back. You didn't wear your fire gear [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=30.32s)]
*  No, not really. I thought you would have I thought you would have worn your your fire gear [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=33.0s)]
*  You guys can turn on the lights in the back if you want [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=37.7s)]
*  It's like not in focus. Oh, yeah, it's really focused on me [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=41.8s)]
*  Okay, well [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=48.84s)]
*  Rock show the people what they're here for anyway you there we go [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=50.44s)]
*  All right, so everybody also. Yeah, make sure that it's not super high [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  I have to check you sometimes no no you can show me if you want. That's fine. So the mic might not be on [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=59.48s)]
*  Um all right, it's a red light [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=66.28s)]
*  Turn around it. Give it to mark. No, it's on. Oh it is okay. We're good here. Look at the there no audio [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=69.2s)]
*  No, there is I just wasn't sure if it was no Mars. Can you see the lights LEDs in the mirror? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=74.36s)]
*  Are you trying to show me in the mirror? Yeah, bro [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=79.72s)]
*  I can't but but I believe just turn it around [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=84.48s)]
*  No [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  Why are you so difficult I don't know what the rules of engagement are with this [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=97.52s)]
*  That makes way more sense, thank you Marsh [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=107.24s)]
*  This man [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=111.24s)]
*  Bill hey, he's talented in other ways [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=112.92s)]
*  This man feels rock a shit. She's my pretty looks. That's my number one talent [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=115.44s)]
*  Just not capitalizing on them. That's how we rose through the ranks all right here flip it to me [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=120.36s)]
*  It's on you all right ladies and gentlemen. We are on our way to the Rose Bowl right now where we are going to be linking up [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=127.12s)]
*  with a new friend of the show [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=133.88s)]
*  His name is Scott [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=137.4s)]
*  he's a producer and he's also a recidivism activist and [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=139.24s)]
*  We're gonna be linking up with him because he is going to be feeding some of the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=144.4s)]
*  firefighters [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=151.2s)]
*  That have been working tirelessly around the clock in combating all the wildfires that have been taking place in Los Angeles so far [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=152.48s)]
*  The last death toll that I saw was around 10 with more than 10,000 structures that have been burned to the ground [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  Obviously, this is one of the most impactful wildfires certainly the most [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=166.76s)]
*  devastating wildfire in California history [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=171.35999999999999s)]
*  and [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=174.4s)]
*  One of the lesser-known aspects of combating wildfires in the state of California is the fact that the California state relies [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=175.0s)]
*  sometimes upwards of 30% of the firefighting force at any given point during wildfire season [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=184.79999999999998s)]
*  California state relies on inmates [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=191.57999999999998s)]
*  incarcerated [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=194.16s)]
*  firefighters and [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=195.72s)]
*  Some of these firefighters make five to ten dollars a day according to [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=199.16s)]
*  I mean according to I guess publicly available data [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=204.04s)]
*  Some of them makes upwards of $26 a day. Obviously these numbers are incredibly low. They are incoherent [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=209.12s)]
*  It's a valuable training program and until recently they had no opportunity to [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  join a [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=221.4s)]
*  full-time [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=223.8s)]
*  staffed employed fire department [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=224.96s)]
*  Since I believe 2022 there have been initiatives to I guess [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=228.12s)]
*  Expunge their record if they have any drug offenses or if they have any sort of if they have a record they're incarcerated [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=234.51999999999998s)]
*  They must have it expunged in order to be able to join in order to be able to get EMT training [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=242.44s)]
*  Which is a requirement to become a California firefighter [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=248.0s)]
*  Before 2022 [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=253.2s)]
*  The gainful employment opportunities for a lot of these incarcerated firefighters was very limited [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=255.68s)]
*  Only part-time jobs at best if they were really lucky [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=260.96000000000004s)]
*  They still as far as I understand cannot join municipalities unless it's like a super rare instance [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=266.08000000000004s)]
*  We're gonna be talking to these guys. They're still technically in prison [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=274.12s)]
*  But for the time being they're out of prison and at the Rose Bowl in the staging area [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=278.44s)]
*  You know after a long day sometimes [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=284.96000000000004s)]
*  12 hour shifts or even longer of [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=288.24s)]
*  combating wildfires [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=292.8s)]
*  Clearing out brush and numerous other things that you have to do [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=294.92s)]
*  They're gonna be eating [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=298.88s)]
*  so we're going to go talk to them about their experiences and [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=301.28s)]
*  What their day-to-day looks like and hopefully help people understand that [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=306.64s)]
*  The incarcerated population are human too now, of course this sounds really silly when I say it [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=313.08000000000004s)]
*  But unfortunately, it's something that must be said because in the United States of America [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=319.16s)]
*  We have one of the most draconian prison structures one of the worst carceral states on the entire planet where the American government [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=322.68s)]
*  houses [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=332.08000000000004s)]
*  25% of the entire planet's prisoner population despite only making up 4% of the entire planet's population [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=333.64s)]
*  That's right. A quarter of the imprisoned people on this planet behind bars in [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=340.82s)]
*  Chains are in the United States of America [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=346.58s)]
*  This is why I always get very upset when people think that the real solution [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=349.34s)]
*  to [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=356.82s)]
*  Combating crime to ensuring that crime doesn't happen in this country is actually more [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=358.3s)]
*  Stringent and more draconian punishments when clearly we have some of [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=364.18s)]
*  the most antiquated dare I say medieval [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=368.66s)]
*  torturous [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=372.82s)]
*  carceral structures on the planet and yet seemingly [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=374.1s)]
*  That has not solved the issue at all [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=378.74s)]
*  Seemingly this kind of deterrence mechanism is not actually successful at lowering [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=381.26s)]
*  the number of the [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=387.70000000000005s)]
*  Serated population in this country [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=390.29999999999995s)]
*  What actually has worked so far? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=392.73999999999995s)]
*  successful initiatives like training programs and reintegration programs a focus on rehabilitation rather than [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=395.59999999999997s)]
*  Incarceration has actually been successful at combating [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=401.17999999999995s)]
*  the likelihood of [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=404.5s)]
*  reoffending having said that however [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=407.41999999999996s)]
*  Even in one of the on paper most successful re in the reintegration initiatives. This is a very valuable training structure [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=410.73999999999995s)]
*  and allowing [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=419.53999999999996s)]
*  prisoners to experience dignity and [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=421.82s)]
*  Actually give back to their communities in this way in this very meaningful way [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=424.5s)]
*  It still seemingly is used as a way to basically have a servile population [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=428.58s)]
*  Slipper as you know is [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=434.85999999999996s)]
*  Constitutionally protected under the 13th amendment slipper is a mechanism of punishment is perfectly permissible allowed and still [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=436.94s)]
*  Exists in the United States of America in many states including, California [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=445.02s)]
*  California as a matter of fact had a ballot initiative in the last election in the general election [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=448.96s)]
*  That we just had where they overwhelmingly voted to [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=453.54s)]
*  preserve [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=457.58s)]
*  Slipper is a form of punishment in the state constitution [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=458.78000000000003s)]
*  this is one of [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=463.58s)]
*  the the awful outcomes of said reality [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=466.26s)]
*  I'm joined of course by Caroline Kwan [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=470.26s)]
*  Marchy poo and [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=474.22s)]
*  Also, my very own volunteer firefighter engineer extraordinaire [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=476.34s)]
*  Marat piker on this wonderful journey. Thank you guys so much for coming. Thank you for that speech [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=480.74s)]
*  I'm gonna cut in just add one thing [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=486.1s)]
*  Okay, so the anti recidivism coalition. That's the that's a group that works with these [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=489.46s)]
*  Creative firefighters who we are going to go talk to they currently have a fundraiser to raise funds for these [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=496.98s)]
*  Firefighters after they are released from prison [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=505.54s)]
*  So I think I posted the link in my discord [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=509.70000000000005s)]
*  But if mods if you can find that link if people are looking for a way to donate [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=513.5s)]
*  But also just to follow their work and understand what it is that they're doing [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=518.62s)]
*  I think [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=523.0200000000001s)]
*  That's the first thing I want to mention the second thing I want to mention is that the way [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=524.22s)]
*  the way [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=529.2600000000001s)]
*  firefighting works [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=530.7800000000001s)]
*  Not even just during times of crisis like this is that they're 24 hours on [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=532.34s)]
*  24 hours off so we're gonna be talking to a group of people who are on the 24 hours off, but obviously they're [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=537.58s)]
*  exhausted and [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=545.98s)]
*  It's it's a lot what they're what they're doing right now, but that's that's how it is [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=548.0600000000001s)]
*  So they work for 24 hours straight, and then they have 24 hours off [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=552.26s)]
*  Yeah, 24 seems like a lot the no I was also talking about the truck that's behind us. Holy moly those headlights, dude [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=557.5s)]
*  Jackets it should be illegal. I can see my future [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=566.3000000000001s)]
*  That's how bright it is [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=572.7s)]
*  I [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=575.34s)]
*  Yeah, yeah 24 hours does seem like a lot. I mean the way you'd get tired [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=578.26s)]
*  No, you're doing physical labor. No. I I know in in like it's really not [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=583.5s)]

*  Yeah [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2404.38s)]
*  Because what I was afraid of happening [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2406.38s)]
*  Happened, which is that we [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2408.38s)]
*  Got gridlocked [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2410.38s)]
*  The reality of LA streets too [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2412.38s)]
*  Is like they're gridlocked [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2414.38s)]
*  Normally [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2416.38s)]
*  I know [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2418.38s)]
*  If you panic everybody and tell everybody to get out the exact same time [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2420.38s)]
*  It's like nothing is moving [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2422.38s)]
*  Yeah, I was telling people [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2424.38s)]
*  Yesterday I was like you know [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2426.38s)]
*  The warnings happen [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2428.38s)]
*  And then you might get [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2430.38s)]
*  In order within a minute [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2432.38s)]
*  Right, you gotta [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2434.38s)]
*  There's hardly any time and so if you are in the LA area [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2436.38s)]
*  You know it is not [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2438.38s)]
*  It is not being overly [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2440.38s)]
*  Dramatic or [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2442.38s)]
*  Fear mongering to say [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2444.38s)]
*  Have stuff prepared [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2446.38s)]
*  Because [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2448.38s)]
*  It does happen really fast [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2450.38s)]
*  But dude we got lucky [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2452.38s)]
*  Yes, I know [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2454.38s)]
*  I know where you are and it was [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2456.38s)]
*  I immediately, when that one sparked up [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2458.38s)]
*  I was like oh fuck [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2460.38s)]
*  If the winds had been worse [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2462.38s)]
*  If [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2464.38s)]
*  I don't know [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2466.38s)]
*  If they had [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2468.38s)]
*  Hadn't been able to do the air drops [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2470.38s)]
*  Then that's what happened Tuesday night [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2472.38s)]
*  Because it was too windy [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2474.38s)]
*  They were grounded because the winds were hurricane level [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2476.38s)]
*  And so [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2478.38s)]
*  All you have then are the [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2480.38s)]
*  Crews on the ground and there's [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2482.38s)]
*  Really not much that they can do [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2484.38s)]
*  I think Palisades right now [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2486.38s)]
*  Is at 11% contained [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2488.38s)]
*  But the fear is like [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2490.38s)]
*  If the winds are [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2492.38s)]
*  If they are bad again [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2494.38s)]
*  Then [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2496.38s)]
*  It might undo a lot of what they've done [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2498.38s)]
*  I'm so like [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2500.38s)]
*  Just [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2502.38s)]
*  Fascinated is the wrong word [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2504.38s)]
*  I can't even wrap my head around [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2506.38s)]
*  How those fires are still [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2508.38s)]
*  Burning because I see the images of Palisades [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2510.38s)]
*  And it's wiped off the map [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2512.38s)]
*  And then it's like oh it's only [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2514.38s)]
*  11% contained [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2516.38s)]
*  What is still burning? Is it just like continuing outward? [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2518.38s)]
*  Like what is happening? [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2520.38s)]
*  Oh, I think we're getting them [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2522.38s)]
*  Oh, good [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2524.38s)]

*  Tell the camera about yourself? [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2700.38s)]
*  Scott Budnick, movie producer [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2702.38s)]
*  Spent 14 years [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2704.38s)]
*  Making The Hangover and Project X [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2706.38s)]
*  And a bunch of stupid shit [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2708.38s)]
*  Went into juvenile hall, met a bunch of incarcerated kids [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2710.38s)]
*  And started doing this [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2712.38s)]
*  And here we are, still making movies but [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2714.38s)]
*  And this is what kind of feeds my soul [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2716.38s)]
*  And what's the group that you work with [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2718.38s)]
*  Predominantly, like you have a recidivism [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2720.38s)]
*  Yeah, ARC [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2722.38s)]
*  So the organization I started [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2724.38s)]
*  After I was making comedies, then I did that [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2726.38s)]
*  And now I'm back in the movie business making movies [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2728.38s)]
*  But I'm still on the board of ARC [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2730.38s)]
*  And doing this kind of work [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2732.38s)]
*  We were supposed to have a meeting [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2734.38s)]
*  That was like [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2736.38s)]
*  I didn't even realize that you were doing this thing [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2738.38s)]

*  And we're usually [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2844.38s)]
*  We're supposed to go to high level security yards [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2846.38s)]

*  With our tools, we hike up [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2932.38s)]

*  We're cut in line, we're scraping brush, we're using [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2952.38s)]
*  Chainsaws, scraping brush for making [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2954.38s)]
*  A path between the fire and the [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2956.38s)]
*  Rest of the fuel [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2958.38s)]
*  The community, the brush [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2960.38s)]
*  So we make that barrier [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2962.38s)]
*  We create that barrier with our hand tools [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2964.38s)]
*  But it takes a long time, it takes hours [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2966.38s)]

*  We go in tight spaces, real steep [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2974.38s)]
*  Where a bulldozer would like fall, if it would try to go up there [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=2976.38s)]

*  17 years, but now I'm at camp [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3060.38s)]
*  I got about [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3062.38s)]
*  I got about 2 years left [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3064.38s)]
*  2 years left [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3066.38s)]
*  Had to work a bunch of time off [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3068.38s)]
*  With schooling and graduating high school [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3070.38s)]
*  How old are you now? [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3072.38s)]
*  I'm 25 now, I'm never forgetting [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3074.38s)]
*  I started at 18, I'm 25 now [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3076.38s)]
*  And you got linked up with this program [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3078.38s)]
*  How many years ago? [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3080.38s)]
*  I got to the fire camp [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3082.38s)]
*  Last year, in November [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3084.38s)]
*  That was the first time [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3086.38s)]
*  Any person like my kind of case [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3088.38s)]
*  Violent crime [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3090.38s)]
*  Was allowed to go to fire camp [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3092.38s)]
*  Last year in November, so we're the start of it [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3094.38s)]
*  What about for adult defenders? [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3096.38s)]
*  Do you think that [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3098.38s)]
*  It's a good program overall, right? [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3100.38s)]
*  Even if it wasn't [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3102.38s)]
*  Fighting wildfires [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3104.38s)]
*  Do you feel like these kinds of initiatives [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3106.38s)]
*  You talked about [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3108.38s)]
*  Feeling like a human, right? [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3110.38s)]
*  Feeling like a sense of dignity [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3112.38s)]
*  From other people [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3114.38s)]
*  Do you feel like these kinds of programs [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3116.38s)]
*  Reintegration programs like that would be successful overall [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3118.38s)]
*  In terms of giving you proper training [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3120.38s)]
*  And giving you tools to [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3122.38s)]
*  To one, lower your sentence [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3124.38s)]
*  Give back to the community somehow [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3126.38s)]
*  And then when you go out [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3128.38s)]
*  You have, well I'm not entirely sure [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3130.38s)]
*  About the wildfire programs in general [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3132.38s)]
*  It's good to have that kind of work experience [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3134.38s)]
*  So you don't feel like your life is lost [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3136.38s)]
*  It could be successful [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3138.38s)]
*  But the thing is [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3140.38s)]
*  The pay [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3142.38s)]
*  The work compared to the pay is like [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3144.38s)]
*  It's crazy [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3146.38s)]
*  So a lot of guys get broke off [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3148.38s)]
*  Their body gets beat up, you know what I mean? [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3150.38s)]
*  But if the pay went up [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3152.38s)]
*  More guys would be more grateful for the opportunity [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3154.38s)]
*  We're grateful for the opportunity [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3156.38s)]
*  We got all this time [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3158.38s)]
*  We're young, we're real excited, we're real motivated [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3160.38s)]
*  It's hard work when we get out [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3162.38s)]
*  We're not running the streets anymore [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3164.38s)]
*  But for the dope crews [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3166.38s)]
*  I mean [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3168.38s)]
*  It just depends on their motivation [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3170.38s)]
*  But it's hard work [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3172.38s)]
*  So if you're lazy, you're not going to last [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3174.38s)]
*  You're going to hate it [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3176.38s)]
*  But if you're motivated to better yourself [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3178.38s)]
*  It's going to work for you [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3180.38s)]
*  As long as you work it [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3182.38s)]
*  I feel you [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3184.38s)]
*  It's nice to hear from you [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3186.38s)]
*  I don't want to keep you from eating your food [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3188.38s)]
*  Appreciate you guys for coming out [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3190.38s)]
*  Nice to meet you too bro [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3192.38s)]
*  Anybody else want to come on? [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3194.38s)]
*  This is Xavier [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3196.38s)]
*  He's down to talk [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3198.38s)]
*  Let's talk [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3200.38s)]
*  Does the steak give you those? [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3202.38s)]
*  We get a brand new one [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3204.38s)]
*  Those are kind of drippy dude [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3206.38s)]
*  Just a little bit [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3208.38s)]
*  It's nice [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3210.38s)]
*  Do you get the Kiva? [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3212.38s)]
*  Yeah [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3214.38s)]
*  They give us everything [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3216.38s)]
*  They prepare you for the fires [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3218.38s)]
*  That way when you get out there [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3220.38s)]
*  Do what you gotta do [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3222.38s)]
*  When you go back, do you get to keep them? [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3224.38s)]
*  I don't think so [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3226.38s)]
*  It's considered an antique [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3228.38s)]
*  I don't think he wants to keep that either [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3230.38s)]
*  I'm not going to yet [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3232.38s)]
*  I'm going to cop his shoes [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3234.38s)]
*  I did see some jackets there [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3236.38s)]
*  They're pretty sweet [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3238.38s)]
*  Chill, we're not going to take their clothes off their back [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3240.38s)]
*  They're fighting wildfires out there [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3242.38s)]
*  We'll give it to you [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3244.38s)]
*  Alright, so how are you guys feeling? [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3246.38s)]
*  The tacos good? [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3248.38s)]
*  We're blessed [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3250.38s)]
*  Do you want to eat first? [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3252.38s)]
*  No, I'm good [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3254.38s)]
*  I just ate [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3256.38s)]
*  While you eat, you talk [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3258.38s)]
*  And then swab it out [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3260.38s)]
*  So again, Xavier and Angel [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3262.38s)]
*  For those who don't want to eat on camera [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3264.38s)]
*  I gotta go wait [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3266.38s)]
*  There's hella ladies watching right now [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3268.38s)]
*  They're going to be judging [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3270.38s)]
*  They're going to be judging the way you're eating [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3272.38s)]
*  Dude [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3274.38s)]
*  Don't even worry [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3276.38s)]
*  He eats on stream [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3278.38s)]
*  And he cannot be worse [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3280.38s)]
*  So how are you guys doing? [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3282.38s)]
*  We're blessed [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3284.38s)]
*  We're taking it all in [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3286.38s)]
*  We just came down from the mountain yesterday [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3288.38s)]
*  We were assigned to the Eaton fire [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3290.38s)]
*  Our division was meeting up with other crews [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3292.38s)]
*  Doing some hand line [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3294.38s)]
*  The dozer only goes so far [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3296.38s)]
*  Our job is really to get the food [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3298.38s)]
*  And we're going to be eating [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3300.38s)]
*  Our job is really to get in the cracks and crevices [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3302.38s)]
*  Where the dozer can't go [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3304.38s)]
*  And when we get out there [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3306.38s)]
*  We work as a team [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3308.38s)]
*  This guy is crazy on the fire [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3310.38s)]
*  This guy goes crazy [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3312.38s)]
*  This guy goes crazy [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3314.38s)]
*  So let me ask you [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3316.38s)]
*  How long have you guys been training? [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3318.38s)]
*  Starting with the program [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3320.38s)]
*  It's a relatively new one right? [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3322.38s)]
*  Firecamps have been around for a while [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3324.38s)]
*  But as far as for us [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3326.38s)]
*  You get sent to a training facility before you're even allowed to come to a firecamp [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3328.38s)]
*  And the training [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3330.38s)]
*  Honestly will not prepare you for what [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3332.38s)]
*  It really is [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3334.38s)]
*  It's scary [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3336.38s)]
*  It's only a two week program [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3338.38s)]
*  You probably do a couple sets of push ups [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3340.38s)]
*  Run a mile or so [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3342.38s)]
*  But it's nothing compared to hiking [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3344.38s)]
*  With a pack on [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3346.38s)]
*  Or having to cut line for hours [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3348.38s)]
*  But yeah like I said [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3350.38s)]
*  You won't be able to really figure out [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3352.38s)]
*  What it's about until you get to a firecamp [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3354.38s)]
*  It's a lengthy process [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3356.38s)]
*  I think these facilities try to [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3358.38s)]
*  Imitate the feeling you get [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3360.38s)]
*  When you're on the mountain [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3362.38s)]
*  The hike can be miles and miles [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3364.38s)]
*  And you've got to carry this water [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3366.38s)]
*  And your circumstances are [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3368.38s)]
*  Subject to change [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3370.38s)]
*  Depending on the winds [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3372.38s)]
*  And how the fire increases over time [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3374.38s)]
*  And these places [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3376.38s)]
*  Really just cannot imitate [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3378.38s)]
*  That emotion [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3380.38s)]
*  That feeling you get when you're up there [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3382.38s)]
*  Before these fires this week [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3384.38s)]
*  Can you guys fought any fires before? [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3386.38s)]
*  Or is this your first? [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3388.38s)]
*  No we were just here [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3390.38s)]
*  At the Big Sur fire, the mountain fire [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3392.38s)]
*  Just recently [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3394.38s)]
*  So that was our most recent fire [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3396.38s)]
*  Fire season just passed so [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3398.38s)]
*  The last fire we have caught is down south [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3400.38s)]
*  This is kind of crazy [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3402.38s)]
*  To be your first experience [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3404.38s)]
*  But you know it's [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3406.38s)]
*  It feels good to be able to [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3408.38s)]
*  Show the community that we're out there [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3410.38s)]
*  We're trying to help the community [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3412.38s)]
*  It's a hard time for everybody [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3414.38s)]
*  God bless those people that were affected [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3416.38s)]
*  By these fires [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3418.38s)]
*  Coming back and your houses burnt down [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3420.38s)]
*  It's very crazy [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3422.38s)]
*  But it feels good to be able to [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3424.38s)]
*  Help these people in some type of way [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3426.38s)]
*  We were talking earlier about [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3428.38s)]
*  How most [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3430.38s)]
*  I don't think a lot of people know that [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3432.38s)]
*  Historically one third of California's fire fighting force [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3434.38s)]
*  Is made up of incarcerated folks [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3436.38s)]
*  And I think right now it's like [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3438.38s)]
*  40 something percent [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3440.38s)]
*  It's a backbone of the operation [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3442.38s)]
*  It's a lot of your motherfuckers out here [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3444.38s)]
*  It's a backbone of the operation [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3446.38s)]
*  And Cal Fire is kind of just [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3448.38s)]
*  The cover up for it [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3450.38s)]
*  We get out there and do the hard work [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3452.38s)]
*  But shout out to those people [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3454.38s)]
*  Those people do work too [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3456.38s)]
*  We get the rough and tough end of the story [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3458.38s)]
*  What do you want people to know [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3462.38s)]
*  About either this program [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3464.38s)]
*  Or about just being an [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3466.38s)]
*  Incarcerated firefighter in general [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3468.38s)]
*  Is there any PSA [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3470.38s)]
*  That you want to make [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3472.38s)]
*  What's something that people probably don't know [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3474.38s)]
*  Considering that a lot of people don't even know [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3476.38s)]
*  That you guys are out here [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3478.38s)]
*  Fighting these fires [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3480.38s)]
*  I mean one thing [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3482.38s)]
*  I would want the public to know is just that [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3484.38s)]
*  We're taking advantage of the second chance that we're being given [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3488.38s)]
*  You know [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3490.38s)]
*  And this is an opportunity to change our lives [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3492.38s)]
*  To be able to get a career once we [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3494.38s)]
*  Leave, you know [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3496.38s)]
*  And we're blessed to be in this position [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3498.38s)]
*  You know [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3500.38s)]
*  And like you said [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3502.38s)]
*  A lot of people may not know about it [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3504.38s)]
*  But we're putting the work in [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3506.38s)]
*  To try to not only better ourselves [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3508.38s)]
*  But better our communities [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3510.38s)]
*  Bro don't pump it up too much [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3512.38s)]
*  They're not going to give you more money [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3514.38s)]
*  It's crazy [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3516.38s)]
*  They get paid $5 a day [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3518.38s)]
*  It's so shit [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3520.38s)]
*  This fire is going to be so much larger [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3522.38s)]
*  If they weren't out here [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3524.38s)]
*  They need to get paid an adequate wage [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3526.38s)]
*  Right? [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3528.38s)]
*  Yeah no that's true [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3530.38s)]
*  We get paid $5 [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3532.38s)]
*  $5.80 an hour [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3534.38s)]
*  You're over here like oh it's great [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3536.38s)]
*  I love being in the fire [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3538.38s)]
*  That was a mistake [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3540.38s)]
*  You're going to get a pay cut out of this [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3542.38s)]
*  You oversold [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3544.38s)]
*  We get paid $24 a day [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3546.38s)]
*  $24 a day [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3548.38s)]
*  Let me tell you this [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3550.38s)]
*  You guys know that there is [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3552.38s)]
*  So you got the normal [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3554.38s)]
*  The rest of the firefighters right? [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3556.38s)]
*  They're also in the staging area over there somewhere [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3558.38s)]
*  So you got that [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3560.38s)]
*  And the municipality gets paid like I think [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3562.38s)]
*  $98,000 or something [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3564.38s)]
*  They get paid pretty well [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3566.38s)]
*  They get good pensions, good benefits [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3568.38s)]
*  They got unions [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3570.38s)]
*  So they're in a decent situation [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3572.38s)]
*  What would you say [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3576.38s)]
*  If I were to tell you that there's also private brigades [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3578.38s)]
*  On top of that [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3580.38s)]
*  There's really rich people like Rick Caruso [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3582.38s)]
*  You know the Grove? You guys know what that is? [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3584.38s)]
*  Yeah the Grove, it's a mall [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3586.38s)]
*  It's very fancy shopping [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3588.38s)]
*  It's lame as fuck [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3590.38s)]
*  He owns the Grove, he's a real estate developer [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3592.38s)]
*  So we hired private firefighters [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3594.38s)]
*  To protect the Grove [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3596.38s)]
*  You know how you heard about the palisades [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3598.38s)]
*  That got burned down, 75% of it's gone [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3600.38s)]
*  Except for [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3602.38s)]
*  Rick Caruso's mall [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3604.38s)]
*  In the middle of the palisades [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3606.38s)]
*  Why? Cause he hired a private brigade [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3608.38s)]
*  Those dudes are making $7,000 a day [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3610.38s)]
*  To do what you guys are doing [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3614.38s)]
*  Money is power [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3616.38s)]
*  I don't want the fucking sheriff to hear me talking like this [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3618.38s)]
*  He encouraged you to talk this way [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3620.38s)]
*  $7,000 a day [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3624.38s)]
*  To do basically what you guys are doing [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3626.38s)]
*  So think about that [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3628.38s)]
*  It's crazy [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3630.38s)]
*  It's a big pill to swallow [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3632.38s)]
*  But in this case [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3634.38s)]
*  The return that we get is our second chance at life [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3636.38s)]
*  This is a pilot program [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3638.38s)]
*  A lot of us made decisions [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3640.38s)]
*  Before our brain was able to develop [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3642.38s)]
*  Before the age of 25 [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3644.38s)]
*  So this is our second chance [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3646.38s)]
*  And this is our second chance to prove it [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3648.38s)]
*  At this point [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3650.38s)]
*  It's a blessing [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3652.38s)]
*  It's not more about the material [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3654.38s)]
*  But the growth that we gain from this experience [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3656.38s)]
*  I think it's [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3658.38s)]
*  Important to talk about [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3660.38s)]
*  How there are obstacles though [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3662.38s)]
*  After you are released [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3664.38s)]
*  You have this training [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3666.38s)]
*  You have this experience [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3668.38s)]
*  You deserve to have this as a career [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3670.38s)]
*  But it's still really difficult [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3672.38s)]
*  Even with legislation that's been passed [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3674.38s)]
*  To work at expunging records [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3676.38s)]

*  It is still difficult [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3684.38s)]
*  The reintegration process is a little tricky [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3686.38s)]
*  And I believe it depends [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3688.38s)]
*  And it varies on the individual [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3690.38s)]
*  Because circumstances are subject to change [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3692.38s)]
*  But at the end of the day [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3694.38s)]

*  How did Twitch come out? [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3782.38s)]
*  2010 [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3784.38s)]
*  When was Twitch first? 2010? [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3786.38s)]
*  It was called JustinTV [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3788.38s)]
*  I'm not homie [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3790.38s)]
*  It used to be called JustinTV [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3792.38s)]
*  And then it became Twitch [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3794.38s)]
*  But it was really COVID where it became popular [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3796.38s)]
*  It started popping in 2020 [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3798.38s)]
*  During COVID [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3800.38s)]
*  But I don't know [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3802.38s)]
*  Everybody was at home [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3804.38s)]
*  I'm not even looking forward [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3806.38s)]
*  How long have you been doing Twitch? [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3808.38s)]
*  I've been doing Twitch since 2018 [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3810.38s)]
*  Before that I was at a company called The Young Turks [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3812.38s)]
*  Doing political commentary there [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3814.38s)]
*  And then I switched over to Twitch [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3816.38s)]
*  And I went full time in 2020 [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3818.38s)]
*  And I've been doing it [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3820.38s)]
*  I mean I love it [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3822.38s)]
*  It's a blessing [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3824.38s)]
*  It's given me fantastic opportunities [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3826.38s)]
*  I get to do insane cool shit like this [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3828.38s)]
*  And I'm a political commentator [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3830.38s)]
*  I talk about the news [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3832.38s)]
*  I talk about the news [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3834.38s)]
*  And I predominantly focus on labor rights [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3836.38s)]
*  Things like that [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3840.38s)]
*  And also rehabilitation over incarceration [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3842.38s)]
*  Things like that [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3846.38s)]
*  Concepts that are unfortunately very foreign [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3848.38s)]
*  For Americans in general [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3850.38s)]
*  Have you all ever seen [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3852.38s)]
*  YouTube videos [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3854.38s)]
*  Of a prison in Norway? [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3856.38s)]
*  Look it up [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3858.38s)]
*  There's a whole show about the worst prisons in the world [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3860.38s)]
*  America has the worst prisons in the world [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3862.38s)]
*  Bar none [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3864.38s)]
*  They say Russian prisons are bad [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3866.38s)]
*  Turkish prisons are bad [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3868.38s)]
*  American prisons are obviously the worst [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3870.38s)]
*  It's a profit industry [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3872.38s)]
*  Definitely [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3874.38s)]
*  They're probably the only industry [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3876.38s)]
*  One problem is that [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3878.38s)]
*  It's good that [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3880.38s)]
*  Incarceration rates have gone down [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3882.38s)]
*  But now they're like oh shit we have less [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3884.38s)]
*  We have less people to use [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3886.38s)]
*  As fire fighters [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3888.38s)]
*  So it's now this [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3890.38s)]
*  Right because they do rely on you guys [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3892.38s)]
*  So much [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3894.38s)]
*  Do you guys think that they know the trauma that it causes? [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3896.38s)]
*  Do you guys think that they know the trauma [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3898.38s)]
*  That causes like [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3900.38s)]
*  I'm not going to lie, they don't give a shit [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3902.38s)]
*  They don't give a shit [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3904.38s)]
*  They don't give a shit when you're out [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3906.38s)]
*  And doing stuff [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3908.38s)]
*  The reason why I ask is because [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3910.38s)]
*  You heard the word institutionalized right? [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3912.38s)]
*  I've heard that word before [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3914.38s)]
*  Oh institutionalized yeah yeah yeah [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3916.38s)]
*  So now I've only did it for like [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3918.38s)]
*  12 years, 13 years but the point is [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3920.38s)]
*  I'm about to go home next month [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3922.38s)]
*  So you go from the cell to this right here [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3924.38s)]
*  It's like, it's culture shocking [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3926.38s)]
*  So now I guess like the fire camp [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3928.38s)]
*  Bringing back light to the fire camp right [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3930.38s)]
*  It does help you because now you start like [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3932.38s)]
*  Like mingling with the public [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3934.38s)]
*  With you guys, the civilians right [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3936.38s)]
*  Which is, I feel foreign with you guys because [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3938.38s)]
*  It feels like I'm part of the prison [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3940.38s)]
*  That's what I was, that's what they locked me to be [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3942.38s)]
*  That's what they wanted me to be so like [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3944.38s)]
*  I want you to get out here [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3946.38s)]
*  And go to a fire camp and act like if you're a firefighter [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3948.38s)]
*  And we do get like minimum training right [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3950.38s)]
*  So how is it that you do that [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3952.38s)]
*  How can I become a better [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3954.38s)]
*  Civilian, citizen [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3956.38s)]
*  Coming from prison to this [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3958.38s)]
*  Like maybe you guys know something about that [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3960.38s)]
*  That's my biggest question [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3962.38s)]
*  I've only been to jail once [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3964.38s)]
*  It was an overnight [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3966.38s)]
*  Are you asking like [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3968.38s)]
*  Personally how you make that transition [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3970.38s)]
*  Right [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3972.38s)]
*  That's a serious question and I made jokes [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3974.38s)]
*  I'm sorry [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3976.38s)]
*  I think it's key is having support right [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3978.38s)]
*  So that you [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3980.38s)]
*  That transition is easier [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3982.38s)]
*  I mean you're right [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3984.38s)]
*  When you spend so long in prison [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3986.38s)]
*  And you either are on the path [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3988.38s)]
*  To the constitution [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3990.38s)]
*  Or you're there [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3992.38s)]
*  It is part of transition now and there is such a lack of [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3994.38s)]
*  There is such a lack of support [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3996.38s)]
*  From the states [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=3998.38s)]
*  So I understand [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4000.38s)]
*  Neither of us have been in that situation before [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4002.38s)]
*  So we can't speak from [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4004.38s)]
*  Personal experience [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4006.38s)]
*  But it's why like [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4008.38s)]
*  We are trying to [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4010.38s)]
*  Create attention to this and say [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4012.38s)]
*  You're somebody who has fire fighting skills [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4014.38s)]
*  You've been there on the front lines [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4016.38s)]
*  You've trained for this [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4018.38s)]
*  How great would it be [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4020.38s)]
*  Having this as a career after you leave [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4022.38s)]
*  So you don't have to [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4024.38s)]
*  Struggle with [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4026.38s)]
*  Job opportunities because [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4028.38s)]
*  You have a criminal record [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4030.38s)]
*  And of course we live in [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4032.38s)]
*  A country where that is an obstacle [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4034.38s)]
*  To you [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4036.38s)]
*  Re-entering into society [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4038.38s)]
*  What kind of services do they have [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4040.38s)]
*  Inside for like [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4042.38s)]
*  When you're about to leave [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4044.38s)]
*  When you're about to get out [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4046.38s)]
*  Do they have like pre-training services [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4048.38s)]
*  Or anything like that that connect you with job providers [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4050.38s)]
*  So in camp it's kind of minimal [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4052.38s)]
*  It seems to me like [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4054.38s)]
*  If it's just Cal Fire, if it's not Cal Fire related [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4056.38s)]
*  You're just not what they're looking for [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4058.38s)]
*  They're not going to put much effort into it [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4060.38s)]
*  Now you do have those individuals that do want to help you right [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4062.38s)]
*  That's more because they're personalized with you [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4064.38s)]
*  And you kind of grow a bond with them over time [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4066.38s)]
*  But as far as them providing something for us [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4068.38s)]
*  Specifically for not Cal Fire [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4070.38s)]
*  There's really none [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4072.38s)]
*  California State doesn't have any sort of reintegration programs [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4074.38s)]
*  California has [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4076.38s)]
*  MCRP program [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4078.38s)]
*  And they got Scott Budden trying to [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4080.38s)]
*  Integrate his ARC program [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4082.38s)]
*  So MCRP is the reintegration program [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4084.38s)]
*  It's not like you're being incarcerated [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4086.38s)]
*  To being on the outside [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4088.38s)]
*  It's limited but it's offering you a way [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4090.38s)]
*  To try to deinstitutionalize [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4092.38s)]
*  But in a sense it's kind of just keeping you on a leash [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4094.38s)]
*  Sadly [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4096.38s)]
*  To say it but that's what it is [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4098.38s)]
*  They do offer some programs but [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4100.38s)]
*  They're very limited [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4102.38s)]
*  Very limited because you're usually private on companies [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4104.38s)]
*  And they most likely have you do it yourself [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4106.38s)]
*  Like when you fill up a role they have you do your own role [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4108.38s)]
*  Yeah [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4110.38s)]
*  It feels like out of 10 only 3 go [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4112.38s)]
*  I feel like if you had a job [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4114.38s)]
*  Coming out [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4116.38s)]
*  If you had something lined up [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4118.38s)]
*  Kind of like this program if it was Cal Fire or anything else [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4120.38s)]
*  You're not going to fuck around [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4122.38s)]
*  You're not going to want to lose that job [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4124.38s)]
*  You're not going to want to fuck around with your parole [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4126.38s)]
*  You're going to lose it [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4128.38s)]
*  It's a tie down [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4130.38s)]
*  That's what is so frustrating about stuff like this [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4132.38s)]
*  I mean [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4134.38s)]
*  It's just so dispensable [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4136.38s)]
*  They just discard you [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4138.38s)]
*  They're like alright fuck off [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4140.38s)]
*  And it's very frustrating [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4142.38s)]
*  So you said you kind of do political work [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4144.38s)]
*  And you're like [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4146.38s)]
*  Since you've been kind of shining the light [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4148.38s)]
*  On some of these spaces [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4150.38s)]
*  Have you seen any light? [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4152.38s)]
*  Progress being made or any light? [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4154.38s)]
*  Development? [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4156.38s)]
*  I mean [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4158.38s)]
*  Yes and no [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4160.38s)]
*  I feel like people are very resistant [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4162.38s)]
*  They're very resilient [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4164.38s)]
*  They don't want to see the humanity of other people [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4166.38s)]
*  And it's [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4168.38s)]
*  It's a dog eat dog out there [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4170.38s)]
*  You know this right? [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4172.38s)]
*  Obviously everyone has [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4174.38s)]
*  Like a fuck you [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4176.38s)]
*  I want to get mind mentality [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4178.38s)]
*  So they don't have any time for anybody else [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4180.38s)]
*  But [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4182.38s)]
*  Overall there are communities out there [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4184.38s)]
*  That obviously guys like Scott [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4186.38s)]
*  Have the kindness of their heart [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4188.38s)]
*  People that try to extend a helping hand [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4190.38s)]
*  To those who [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4192.38s)]
*  Just need [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4194.38s)]
*  Just a little bit of a leg up [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4196.38s)]
*  To be able to reintegrate [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4198.38s)]
*  To be able to become valuable members of society [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4200.38s)]
*  There's great examples of that too [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4202.38s)]
*  There's plenty of comics [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4204.38s)]
*  Like X-Pons that made some of themselves after [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4206.38s)]
*  Big blazes [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4208.38s)]
*  Big blazes? [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4210.38s)]
*  Made it big blazes [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4212.38s)]
*  I have seen so many newcomers [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4214.38s)]
*  Just making foul [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4216.38s)]
*  Incarcerated firefighters and I've seen [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4218.38s)]
*  I know it's the first time [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4220.38s)]
*  That they've heard about that [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4222.38s)]
*  So I think it's even just that first step of life [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4224.38s)]
*  A lot of the guys out here [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4226.38s)]
*  Who are fighting [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4228.38s)]
*  Come on man [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4230.38s)]
*  You're standing right here? [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4232.38s)]
*  I just want to say hello [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4234.38s)]
*  To my daughter out there [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4236.38s)]
*  I've been sitting here about 11 years [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4238.38s)]
*  And I love you baby [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4240.38s)]
*  And hopefully I'll be out [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4242.38s)]
*  Soon and I miss you [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4244.38s)]
*  A lot [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4246.38s)]
*  Be good out there and get your mom right [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4248.38s)]
*  Okay? Love you [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4250.38s)]
*  He's doing the Lord's work, he's protecting people in California [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4252.38s)]
*  Right now, every day [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4254.38s)]
*  Do my best [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4256.38s)]
*  My name is Salvador Serra [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4258.38s)]
*  I'm out of Telerita County [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4260.38s)]
*  And I miss everybody [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4262.38s)]
*  Nice to meet you [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4264.38s)]
*  How much time you got? [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4266.38s)]
*  I got about 6 months left [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4268.38s)]
*  Oh hell yeah, okay [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4270.38s)]
*  Unfortunately I came back on another term [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4272.38s)]
*  But this has helped me to go a little bit more [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4274.38s)]
*  To expand my horizons a little bit more [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4278.38s)]
*  Build a little bit more [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4280.38s)]
*  I built a little bit more [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4282.38s)]
*  And I focused on myself [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4284.38s)]
*  Okay [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4286.38s)]
*  I'm very appreciative [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4288.38s)]
*  You didn't do this before hand? [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4290.38s)]
*  I've never done it before [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4292.38s)]
*  But I'm hanging with a crew that's way younger than me [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4294.38s)]
*  And they're all on fire [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4296.38s)]
*  And I'm a big fan [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4298.38s)]
*  How old are you? [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4300.38s)]
*  How many push ups are you doing? [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4302.38s)]
*  I'm 53 years old [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4304.38s)]
*  And I'm going with all these [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4306.38s)]
*  20's and 30's [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4308.38s)]
*  If I could do it, anybody could do it [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4310.38s)]
*  Even the Wild Pea crew [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4312.38s)]
*  Everybody in this crew is under 25 [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4314.38s)]
*  Tell them OG [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4316.38s)]
*  OG's under 25 too [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4318.38s)]
*  At heart [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4320.38s)]
*  I've been walking in circles for many years [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4322.38s)]
*  I appreciate it very much [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4326.38s)]
*  Of course, nice to meet you man [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4330.38s)]
*  Thank you for everything you're doing [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4332.38s)]
*  Keeping the streets safe [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4334.38s)]
*  So we are [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4336.38s)]
*  In the type of coverage [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4338.38s)]
*  And time [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4340.38s)]
*  As left as we tried [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4342.38s)]
*  Great connections [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4344.38s)]
*  You look nervous [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4346.38s)]
*  You look better for everybody [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4348.38s)]
*  He was asking why do we care [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4350.38s)]
*  How we got involved [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4352.38s)]
*  That's a long story [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4354.38s)]
*  I try to explain to people [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4356.38s)]
*  All the time [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4358.38s)]
*  That are listening [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4360.38s)]
*  That they are closer to where you are [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4362.38s)]
*  And I am closer to where you are [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4364.38s)]
*  We are to a guy like Elon Musk [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4366.38s)]
*  Or a billionaire [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4368.38s)]
*  Or a multi-millionaire [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4370.38s)]
*  Owns multiple condos, properties [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4372.38s)]
*  Obviously sometimes [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4374.38s)]
*  People don't have [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4376.38s)]
*  A good starting position in life [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4378.38s)]
*  And they get lost [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4380.38s)]
*  In the system [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4382.38s)]
*  No one is truly evil [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4384.38s)]
*  There's some of us [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4386.38s)]
*  But like [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4388.38s)]
*  Child molesters [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4390.38s)]
*  They're evil [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4392.38s)]
*  You know [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4394.38s)]
*  Everybody has a story [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4396.38s)]
*  Everybody's a normal human being [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4398.38s)]
*  It's all about maximizing potential [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4400.38s)]
*  Breaking that stigma [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4402.38s)]
*  A long time ago [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4404.38s)]
*  I saw this visual [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4406.38s)]
*  Of a race [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4408.38s)]
*  And not everybody is at the same starting [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4410.38s)]
*  Some people are ahead [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4412.38s)]
*  And some people are behind [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4414.38s)]
*  But you're all running that same race [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4416.38s)]
*  And that is [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4418.38s)]
*  The reality is that [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4420.38s)]
*  In life [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4422.38s)]
*  You might be ahead [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4424.38s)]
*  Or you might be behind [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4426.38s)]
*  When you start out that race [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4428.38s)]
*  A lot of people [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4430.38s)]
*  They have no control [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4432.38s)]
*  Of the circumstances in life [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4434.38s)]
*  That they're born into [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4436.38s)]
*  And they shouldn't be demonized [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4438.38s)]
*  For something like [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4440.38s)]
*  Having been in prison in a country [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4442.38s)]
*  That makes a lot of money [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4444.38s)]
*  Off of imprisoning people [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4446.38s)]
*  For frankly things they shouldn't [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4448.38s)]
*  They shouldn't be in jail [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4450.38s)]
*  For the first place [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4452.38s)]
*  Or at least being for a much [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4454.38s)]
*  Shorter period of time and a focus on [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4456.38s)]
*  Rehabilitation, these sorts of programs are good for that [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4458.38s)]
*  Especially, very important for that [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4460.38s)]
*  Because everybody needs to be [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4462.38s)]
*  Busy bro, that's what it is [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4464.38s)]
*  If you're not busy you're going to go fucking crazy [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4466.38s)]
*  Sitting around [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4468.38s)]
*  Looking at the same gray bars all fucking day [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4470.38s)]
*  So obviously [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4472.38s)]
*  I think [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4474.38s)]
*  Breaking that pattern a little bit for you guys [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4476.38s)]
*  I assume [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4478.38s)]
*  Very helpful [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4480.38s)]
*  Bro you have the Luffy star [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4482.38s)]
*  You know what that is? One Piece? [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4484.38s)]
*  It's an anime [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4486.38s)]
*  It's a very famous anime [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4488.38s)]
*  And the main character [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4490.38s)]
*  Has the exact same star that you have [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4492.38s)]
*  I'm not related to it [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4494.38s)]
*  Probably [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4496.38s)]
*  You bring up that anime at any age [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4498.38s)]
*  So you spoke about [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4500.38s)]
*  The role of [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4502.38s)]
*  Individualism right? [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4504.38s)]
*  I think you're talking about the collective [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4506.38s)]
*  I didn't hear the collective mindset [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4508.38s)]
*  And you spoke about the race [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4510.38s)]
*  So my question is how do we bridge that gap [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4512.38s)]
*  Where we bring the people more together [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4514.38s)]
*  For that collective all-in-one [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4516.38s)]
*  I think it's a matter of [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4518.38s)]
*  Recognizing [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4520.38s)]
*  For you guys it's a little bit different [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4522.38s)]
*  Obviously because you're [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4524.38s)]
*  In prison [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4526.38s)]
*  So obviously there's very rigid [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4528.38s)]
*  Structure to your life [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4530.38s)]
*  I think a lot of that is [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4532.38s)]
*  You see collectivization in the worst aspects of it maybe [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4534.38s)]
*  Like in the same way that the military does it [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4536.38s)]
*  Where they break you down and reduce you to a number [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4538.38s)]
*  But I think overall [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4540.38s)]
*  People should [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4542.38s)]
*  Recognize that they have the exact same [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4544.38s)]
*  Interest in life [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4546.38s)]
*  That's my principle at least [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4548.38s)]
*  I believe that everybody wants a hot meal [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4550.38s)]
*  A roof over their head [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4552.38s)]
*  You know what I mean? And a decent job [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4554.38s)]
*  And maybe to get pussy on the weekends [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4556.38s)]
*  And watch some fucking anime [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4558.38s)]
*  Play some video games [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4560.38s)]
*  Yeah [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4562.38s)]
*  Shit you can say I'm twitch [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4564.38s)]
*  Yeah I can say that [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4566.38s)]
*  You can say whatever you want [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4568.38s)]
*  Now you know what twitch is [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4570.38s)]
*  Serious topics and then also [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4572.38s)]
*  But that's what everybody wants [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4574.38s)]
*  And I think it's always [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4576.38s)]
*  The limitation of the system [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4578.38s)]
*  That cause people [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4580.38s)]
*  To not be able to achieve that [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4582.38s)]
*  In the most successful way [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4584.38s)]
*  There is virtually nothing different [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4586.38s)]
*  Between [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4588.38s)]
*  Any of you guys and someone like myself [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4590.38s)]
*  Except for [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4592.38s)]
*  I'm willing to bet that my beginning point [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4594.38s)]
*  Is more affluent, more privileged [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4596.38s)]
*  You know what I mean? That's it [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4598.38s)]
*  I fucked up when I was a kid [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4600.38s)]
*  I fucked up when I was a young adult [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4602.38s)]
*  I got arrested [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4604.38s)]
*  But the difference is [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4606.38s)]
*  I was broke when I got arrested [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4608.38s)]
*  So that's not the best example [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4610.38s)]
*  But still I had a network [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4612.38s)]

*  Give you the privilege of dropping your percentage [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4928.38s)]
*  Of how much you have to do out of your sentence [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4930.38s)]
*  So in this case I was a violent offender [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4932.38s)]
*  So I go from 85 [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4934.38s)]
*  Without being in these programs you go to 66 [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4936.38s)]
*  And when you enter the program you do half time [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4938.38s)]
*  So 50% [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4940.38s)]
*  Let me ask you this [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4942.38s)]

*  For people who are just like [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4950.38s)]
*  So uninitiated with this process [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4952.38s)]
*  What do you think leads someone in your experience [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4954.38s)]

*  Like making [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4960.38s)]
*  Decisions like the ones that you made [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4962.38s)]

*  Being conformed to where you're at [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4966.38s)]
*  What? [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4968.38s)]
*  Being conformed to where you're at [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4970.38s)]
*  No conformism [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4972.38s)]
*  Being okay with content with what your surroundings are [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4974.38s)]
*  You know some people don't know no better [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4976.38s)]
*  You know some people are born under certain circumstances [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4978.38s)]
*  Like you said or like [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4980.38s)]
*  The young lady said [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4982.38s)]

*  I'm still young man come on [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4990.38s)]

*  Circumstances are a little different [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4994.38s)]
*  And some people get trapped in [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4996.38s)]
*  In a box [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=4998.38s)]
*  And they no longer can see through that [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5000.38s)]
*  It's a smoke screen you know and that's all they know [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5002.38s)]
*  Sometimes that's all they know [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5004.38s)]
*  And you can't blame them for it [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5006.38s)]
*  Because like you said they get lost in the system [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5008.38s)]
*  So I mean [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5010.38s)]
*  It becomes habitual [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5012.38s)]
*  When they get out they come back because there's no [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5014.38s)]
*  Backing to whatever [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5016.38s)]

*  But when you're back out there [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5238.38s)]
*  You sleep out there [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5240.38s)]
*  They give you gear [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5242.38s)]
*  And then they give you sleeping gear [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5244.38s)]
*  That's pretty much what you got right here [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5246.38s)]
*  You got your no max shirt on [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5248.38s)]
*  They don't give you any sleeping gear? [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5250.38s)]
*  No, not on the mount [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5252.38s)]
*  So like I said [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5254.38s)]
*  You can be out there scraping line [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5256.38s)]
*  Or night, whatever it may be [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5258.38s)]
*  Trying to get a fire out [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5260.38s)]
*  What protective gear do you have? [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5262.38s)]
*  Like a shroud [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5264.38s)]
*  You got a shroud that's on your helmet [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5266.38s)]
*  Or protective smoke [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5268.38s)]
*  Pretty much the same gear as California [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5270.38s)]
*  Pretty much the same gear, just in different colors [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5272.38s)]
*  Is it orange or is it yellow? [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5274.38s)]
*  Orange [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5276.38s)]
*  And then as soon as yours are done [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5278.38s)]
*  They ask for you [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5280.38s)]
*  As soon as we're done [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5282.38s)]
*  We go back to the bus [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5284.38s)]
*  We have our tools, sharpen them up [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5286.38s)]
*  Be fire ready [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5288.38s)]
*  We call it another fire or whatever it may be [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5290.38s)]
*  Why did you decide to join the program [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5294.38s)]
*  3 years ago or 4 years ago? [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5296.38s)]
*  I'm going to be honest, when I first joined [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5298.38s)]
*  I just did it as far as the time reduction [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5300.38s)]
*  But once I started doing it, I kind of liked it [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5302.38s)]
*  But once I got released, I wouldn't do it [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5304.38s)]
*  Because like I said, there's just too much going on [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5306.38s)]
*  As far as the breathing [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5308.38s)]
*  As far as the air, different chemicals and stuff like that [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5310.38s)]
*  As far as I know, my mother-in-law that I talked to [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5312.38s)]
*  Basically they said it's just a long-term [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5314.38s)]
*  Health condition, of course [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5316.38s)]
*  But they're not going to be using all the different chemicals [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5318.38s)]
*  Do you guys get any medical attention? [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5320.38s)]
*  No, they ask us if we need [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5322.38s)]
*  If anybody got hurt [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5324.38s)]
*  Anybody injured, any medical conditions [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5326.38s)]
*  But if it ain't really like [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5328.38s)]
*  You got really hurt on the fire line [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5330.38s)]
*  Spraying ankle, none of that type of stuff [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5332.38s)]
*  You kind of just go back to working the next day [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5334.38s)]
*  Like you said, 24 hours down, 24 hours up [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5336.38s)]
*  But you're not really getting a full 24 hour down [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5338.38s)]
*  You're going to get the 24 hour on the line [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5340.38s)]
*  You're not getting a full 24 hour down [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5342.38s)]
*  You got to come back, you got to shower [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5344.38s)]
*  You got to go to eat [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5346.38s)]
*  You got to go to get lunches [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5348.38s)]
*  It's also a lot of noise [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5350.38s)]
*  A lot of activity [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5352.38s)]
*  They got to go to briefing, get the assignment [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5354.38s)]
*  So it's a lot that's going on [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5356.38s)]
*  Are you guys staying in these tents? [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5358.38s)]
*  Are they nice? [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5360.38s)]
*  Are they better than prison? [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5362.38s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely better than prison [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5364.38s)]
*  God damn, prison sucks [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5366.38s)]
*  Baker, I want to ask you the same question [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5368.38s)]
*  They go back to a camp after this [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5370.38s)]
*  Yeah, we go back to a camp, so we're going to go back to prison [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5372.38s)]
*  So we go back to camp, so our camp is maybe staging [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5374.38s)]
*  I mean our camp is in Palmdale [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5376.38s)]
*  We're in California actually [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5378.38s)]
*  So I want to ask you why you joined the program [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5380.38s)]
*  So I want to ask you why you joined the program [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5382.38s)]

*  When I came back last year [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5386.38s)]
*  My points were low [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5388.38s)]
*  Instead of going to a yard, I said Sydney Camp [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5390.38s)]
*  I used to be in Colesburg 12 years ago [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5392.38s)]
*  I was in Colesburg, Friday Camp 12 years ago [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5394.38s)]

*  When you're released again? [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5414.38s)]
*  I wouldn't mind, I'm 56 years old [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5416.38s)]
*  I'm still doing what I used to do [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5418.38s)]

*  You got some, you got some, that's dicks, but for the most part [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5482.38s)]
*  That's only one, but for the most part we got good cops [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5484.38s)]
*  You got some small ones, then you got some that's just assholes [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5486.38s)]
*  That basically don't care [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5490.38s)]
*  Like I said, it's just job security [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5492.38s)]
*  That's how I look at it, job security [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5494.38s)]
*  Do you feel like they're [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5496.38s)]
*  Is it like a personality issue? [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5498.38s)]
*  Or do you think it's just like, they're just insecure [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5502.38s)]
*  I think it's all of them [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5504.38s)]
*  I think it's personality, I think it's like insecure [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5506.38s)]
*  And I think also, some of these cops [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5508.38s)]
*  They look at you down as far as like animals [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5510.38s)]
*  They look at you like animals, you know [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5512.38s)]
*  But like I said, a lot of people in here [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5514.38s)]
*  You know, got good hearts, you know, some of them have made mistakes [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5516.38s)]
*  You know, and just looking for a second chance [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5518.38s)]
*  Everybody here is not a bad person, they go through life [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5520.38s)]
*  You know, for a lot of, in prison, a lot of rehabilitation going on [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5522.38s)]
*  So you know, like I said, a lot of people [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5524.38s)]
*  Rehabilitating themselves and just looking for a better chance [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5526.38s)]
*  At life [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5528.38s)]
*  You feel, it's hard, right? [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5530.38s)]
*  It's hard to do rehabilitation in the current structure that exists [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5532.38s)]
*  In the current carceral structure [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5536.38s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5538.38s)]
*  It's like they make it difficult [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5540.38s)]
*  I got some friends that [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5542.38s)]
*  Were in county jail back in the day [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5544.38s)]
*  And they were, they basically describe it as like [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5546.38s)]
*  When you go in [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5548.38s)]
*  It's impossible for you not to be worse [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5550.38s)]
*  Than you, when you initially went in [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5552.38s)]
*  You get worse [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5554.38s)]
*  It's a lot of trauma that's going on within prison [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5556.38s)]
*  It's a lot of trauma, it's a lot of things that you see that's going on in prison [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5558.38s)]

*  All different types of stuff that's going on on the yard [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5566.38s)]
*  So basically like that can be traumatizing [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5568.38s)]
*  Especially if you've been doing it so long, you'd be like institutionalized [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5570.38s)]

*  Whatever I'm doing at camp [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5880.38s)]
*  I would take that over [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5882.38s)]
*  The pay is cool [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5884.38s)]

*  You're teaching yourself [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5914.38s)]
*  How to work hard [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5916.38s)]

*  It's a mind thing [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5928.38s)]
*  It's something to train yourself [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5930.38s)]
*  Just keep on moving forward [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5932.38s)]

*  A lot of people have never [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5936.38s)]
*  I'm gonna tell you, this is the hardest work I've ever done [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5938.38s)]
*  And I've worked my whole life [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5940.38s)]
*  I've remodeled log homes [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5942.38s)]

*  Where are you from originally? [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5948.38s)]
*  I'm from Tulare County, Porterville [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5950.38s)]
*  Tulare County [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5952.38s)]
*  I have no idea what that is [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5954.38s)]
*  It's not too big [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5956.38s)]
*  What about you? Where are you from? [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5958.38s)]
*  Oh, you're from Bakersfield [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5960.38s)]
*  This is a good place to learn [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5962.38s)]
*  If you've got a good attitude about this place [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5964.38s)]
*  Regardless, when everybody comes from a different walk of life [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5966.38s)]
*  This is a place where we can all come and agree on [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5968.38s)]
*  We're gonna go work hard today [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5970.38s)]
*  On the line, you're all brothers [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5972.38s)]
*  You've got each other's backs [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5974.38s)]
*  No matter what race, ethnicity, religion [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5976.38s)]
*  All that stuff, it just doesn't mean anything [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5978.38s)]
*  Other people have brought that up a lot as well [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5980.38s)]
*  There's a lot of people who are oblivious [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5982.38s)]
*  To the conditions of prison in general [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5984.38s)]
*  Other people have also brought up the racial tension in general [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5986.38s)]
*  But it's not like [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5988.38s)]
*  Can you briefly elaborate on that [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5990.38s)]
*  If you don't mind? [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5992.38s)]
*  Racial tensions in prison [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5994.38s)]
*  Everybody's entitled to their beliefs [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5996.38s)]
*  Some people in their beliefs, they don't like others [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=5998.38s)]
*  We all grow up with different biases [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6000.38s)]
*  Some we know, some we don't [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6002.38s)]
*  Decisions and politics are based [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6004.38s)]
*  Sometimes off race [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6006.38s)]
*  The same person [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6008.38s)]
*  I hang with a lot at Spanxon Street [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6010.38s)]
*  I remember being on the yard [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6012.38s)]
*  One of the Cortez's [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6014.38s)]
*  I was in the yard [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6016.38s)]
*  One of the Cortez's [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6018.38s)]
*  I couldn't even kick it with him [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6020.38s)]
*  Because shit was in the way [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6022.38s)]
*  But still my boy [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6024.38s)]
*  That's the part that really got me messed up [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6026.38s)]
*  I grew up in sports and military kind of people around me [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6028.38s)]
*  It didn't matter the color of a person [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6032.38s)]
*  They're my friends [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6034.38s)]
*  You come to prison [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6036.38s)]
*  I show up and they're like [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6038.38s)]
*  I'm a new white guy [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6040.38s)]
*  They're like, you can't even talk to that dude [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6042.38s)]
*  You can't even hang out here [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6044.38s)]
*  It's their protection too, right? [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6046.38s)]
*  You have to be slotted in [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6048.38s)]
*  Yeah, sometimes [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6050.38s)]
*  So what I learned during college classes [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6052.38s)]
*  Is humans we have what's called in-group bias [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6054.38s)]
*  I identify with somebody [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6056.38s)]
*  Of my skin, of my ethnic group [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6058.38s)]
*  Of my area [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6060.38s)]
*  And it's him and it's us [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6062.38s)]
*  We do that naturally [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6064.38s)]
*  That's the defensive mechanism [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6066.38s)]
*  That's based on instinct [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6068.38s)]
*  We're not born with it [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6070.38s)]
*  We learn that through life [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6072.38s)]
*  We tend to emphasize it a lot [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6074.38s)]
*  Over small shit [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6076.38s)]
*  Over insignificant shit [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6078.38s)]
*  We were saying that that's a big part of why [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6080.38s)]
*  Camp is better as well [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6082.38s)]
*  Because you can just kick it wherever you want [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6084.38s)]
*  With nothing [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6086.38s)]
*  With none of the other additional animosity [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6088.38s)]
*  Yeah [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6090.38s)]
*  A lot of that stuff is gone [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6092.38s)]
*  It rears its ugly head sometimes [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6094.38s)]
*  Because it's against people's beliefs [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6096.38s)]
*  But the majority of the people [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6098.38s)]
*  In camp, they're going to [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6100.38s)]
*  They're going to nail that in the butt [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6102.38s)]
*  We're not doing that here [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6104.38s)]
*  That's not how it works [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6106.38s)]
*  Is it like community policing [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6108.38s)]
*  We're not going to tolerate that here? [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6110.38s)]
*  When somebody comes in [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6112.38s)]
*  An example would be [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6114.38s)]
*  Somebody with a bad attitude [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6116.38s)]
*  How do they weed themselves out? [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6118.38s)]
*  They usually weed themselves out [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6120.38s)]
*  They show up [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6122.38s)]
*  You become like [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6124.38s)]
*  Everybody that's been there, they have a program [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6126.38s)]
*  They got something that works [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6128.38s)]
*  Everybody's getting along [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6130.38s)]
*  We'll have a big old group [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6132.38s)]
*  Something going on in the camp [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6134.38s)]
*  We're rocking the boat too much [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6136.38s)]
*  We need to come to an agreement [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6138.38s)]
*  We got some new guys coming in [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6140.38s)]
*  We run it down to them [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6142.38s)]
*  This is what we're doing [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6144.38s)]
*  We're not doing the crazy high power politics [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6146.38s)]
*  We're just here [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6148.38s)]
*  How do they weed it out? [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6150.38s)]
*  Do they just send them back? [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6152.38s)]
*  Either they're going to get write ups [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6154.38s)]
*  From the dumb stuff that they're doing [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6156.38s)]
*  Or they'll clash with somebody [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6158.38s)]
*  Because a person will try to [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6160.38s)]
*  Take them underneath their wing [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6162.38s)]
*  Each one to each one is the rule [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6164.38s)]
*  When I first get into prison [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6166.38s)]
*  So hey man, you're my boy from my area [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6168.38s)]
*  I'm going to lace you [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6170.38s)]
*  This is why you don't do it [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6172.38s)]
*  But if you don't want to listen [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6174.38s)]
*  And you want to buck the system [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6176.38s)]
*  Eventually you're going to clash heads with somebody [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6178.38s)]
*  They're going to see the person that's causing problems [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6180.38s)]
*  You can just [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6182.38s)]
*  They don't stick around too long [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6184.38s)]
*  The cops see everything [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6186.38s)]
*  They watch us [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6188.38s)]
*  Are these the same [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6190.38s)]
*  Camp cops? [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6192.38s)]
*  Or are they coming in from [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6194.38s)]
*  Those are from our camp [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6196.38s)]
*  They're regulars there [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6198.38s)]
*  They've spent years in prison systems [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6200.38s)]
*  Worked their way down to a camp [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6202.38s)]
*  A lot of them are [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6204.38s)]
*  Veterans and they know the game [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6206.38s)]
*  Do you feel like they're [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6208.38s)]
*  Nicer overall than [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6210.38s)]
*  Normal COs inside of [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6212.38s)]
*  The regular county jail [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6214.38s)]
*  I've met some [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6216.38s)]
*  Good and tolerant [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6218.38s)]
*  COs since I've been in prison [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6220.38s)]
*  A lot of those COs are now [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6222.38s)]
*  Working at camps [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6224.38s)]
*  These guys that are here [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6226.38s)]
*  They grew as that [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6228.38s)]
*  Just like it's good for us to be [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6230.38s)]
*  Down here, you know what I'm saying [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6232.38s)]
*  School is where we want to be, it's the same thing for them [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6234.38s)]
*  They've been surprisingly chill [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6236.38s)]
*  Under normal circumstances [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6238.38s)]
*  Regular fucking beat cops [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6240.38s)]
*  They're more annoying [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6242.38s)]
*  You have some [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6244.38s)]
*  But they [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6246.38s)]
*  Everywhere is going to have their assholes [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6248.38s)]
*  And their hardasses [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6250.38s)]
*  The people that are kind of like [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6252.38s)]
*  Still on that four yard [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6254.38s)]
*  Have you been able to shower? [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6256.38s)]
*  Yes [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6258.38s)]
*  Apparently [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6260.38s)]
*  They haven't been able to shower in five days [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6262.38s)]
*  When we showed up [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6264.38s)]
*  There was only four of us [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6266.38s)]
*  It was beating that ground [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6268.38s)]
*  And then I got to shower [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6270.38s)]
*  Yeah [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6272.38s)]
*  He was saying that Scott is bringing in [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6274.38s)]
*  He got Coachella to donate [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6276.38s)]
*  Some mobile showers [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6278.38s)]
*  For these guys because they haven't been able to [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6280.38s)]
*  Shower in five days [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6282.38s)]
*  They just barely showed up today, the mobile showers just got here today [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6284.38s)]
*  They do [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6286.38s)]
*  It was a situation that they had told us [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6288.38s)]
*  Somebody on the Cal Fire [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6290.38s)]
*  Said that they don't want no inmates using [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6292.38s)]
*  Their showers, that's why we had to walk all the way [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6294.38s)]
*  Around and then we just got turned around [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6296.38s)]
*  And we were just going to go shower [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6298.38s)]
*  We still had shower jets [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6300.38s)]
*  They took our unit [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6302.38s)]
*  Yeah they took our unit [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6304.38s)]
*  And they told us that they don't want no inmates [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6306.38s)]
*  In their showers, so we still have a shower jet [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6308.38s)]
*  So [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6310.38s)]
*  We got Coachella to donate us our own [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6312.38s)]
*  Mobile shower unit [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6314.38s)]
*  That way we don't have to go to this [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6316.38s)]
*  I'm off of 24 just from yesterday, still in shower [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6318.38s)]
*  Or been to safe today [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6320.38s)]
*  That's crazy [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6322.38s)]
*  But then when I bring up situations like this [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6324.38s)]
*  When they get seen by the higher ups [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6326.38s)]
*  I get kicked out of camp [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6328.38s)]
*  No for sure, this is going to be retaliation for speaking up [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6330.38s)]
*  And I know I got that coming [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6332.38s)]
*  No good deed goes unfunded for sure [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6334.38s)]
*  If we know what you guys were doing last night, you guys were cutting towards us last night [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6336.38s)]
*  That was a rough cut [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6338.38s)]
*  How long have you been in and out? [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6340.38s)]
*  How long have you been going into the fight? [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6342.38s)]
*  We do 24 up, 24 down [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6344.38s)]
*  So just like yesterday we spent the whole 24 hours [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6346.38s)]
*  On the fire line, we're supposed to have 24 hours of rest today [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6348.38s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow, 24 hours [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6350.38s)]
*  And it just rotates like that [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6352.38s)]
*  Yeah [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6354.38s)]
*  To the mop up stage [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6356.38s)]
*  We usually, this is a fed fire now [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6358.38s)]
*  So we're kind of just like [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6360.38s)]
*  What we do, state and fed [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6362.38s)]
*  Is different, like whenever state [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6364.38s)]
*  Remember it's a state fire, we'll do a completely different cut [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6366.38s)]
*  We'll do a way more bigger cut [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6368.38s)]
*  We'll do a 10 foot cut with a [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6370.38s)]
*  4 foot scrape [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6372.38s)]
*  But these guys, they have this smaller one right now [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6374.38s)]
*  They just have us doing the [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6376.38s)]
*  6 foot cut with a 2 foot scrape [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6378.38s)]
*  Yesterday we went in with an 8 foot cut [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6380.38s)]
*  And a 4 foot scrape [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6382.38s)]
*  It depends on which fire you're at [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6384.38s)]
*  And where you're at [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6386.38s)]
*  You guys on the evening? [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6388.38s)]
*  We were told to follow the feds [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6390.38s)]
*  They're running a little different right now [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6392.38s)]
*  We were on the spot where the dozer line [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6394.38s)]
*  With the fire going all over [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6396.38s)]
*  You guys were coming towards us, we were going up [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6398.38s)]
*  Where Fenner Canyon was meeting you guys [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6400.38s)]
*  That was rough last night bro [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6402.38s)]
*  They had us trenching the whole way up [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6404.38s)]
*  And I'm second blast count [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6406.38s)]
*  I'm swinging my arms all day [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6408.38s)]
*  I'm on a saw bro [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6410.38s)]
*  I've never cut that much in my life bro [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6412.38s)]
*  Oh my god [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6414.38s)]

*  It's already here or what? [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6418.38s)]
*  Luckily we got Lieutenant Hill and he's trying to push the line for us [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6420.38s)]
*  I respect it [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6422.38s)]

*  For sure [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6432.38s)]
*  What's going to happen is going to happen [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6434.38s)]
*  No matter what [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6436.38s)]
*  It's kind of how the dice rolls around here [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6438.38s)]
*  You want to know what happens [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6440.38s)]

*  You don't need it anymore? [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6444.38s)]
*  We know what's happening [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6446.38s)]

*  You guys play at camp right? [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6454.38s)]
*  You got a PS4? [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6456.38s)]
*  Not at our camp though [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6458.38s)]
*  We're trying to get it going over there [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6460.38s)]
*  We have some activities for us [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6462.38s)]
*  What is it? [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6464.38s)]

*  You guys get internet access or no? [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6472.38s)]
*  No internet access [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6474.38s)]
*  They don't want to have that [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6476.38s)]
*  Why not? [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6478.38s)]
*  We're still a person [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6480.38s)]
*  We're still a person [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6482.38s)]
*  So we can't be limited [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6484.38s)]
*  You're still a person? [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6486.38s)]
*  It's a human right I think [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6488.38s)]
*  I think you should be able to get internet access [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6490.38s)]
*  What are you going to do with internet access? [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6492.38s)]
*  Crimes? [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6494.38s)]
*  Okay maybe [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6496.38s)]
*  Inside the frizz they have tablets but [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6498.38s)]
*  At the camp we don't have tablets [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6500.38s)]
*  Oh really? [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6502.38s)]
*  So yeah sometimes I'll see like [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6504.38s)]
*  Dudes sneaking a phone [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6506.38s)]
*  And they'll go live on TikTok [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6508.38s)]
*  Yeah? [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6510.38s)]

*  You got TikTok? [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6516.38s)]
*  By the time you get out [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6518.38s)]
*  It'll be popping [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6520.38s)]
*  But I don't know [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6524.38s)]
*  So what made you come here? [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6526.38s)]
*  So what made you come here and... [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6528.38s)]
*  So [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6530.38s)]
*  I talk about [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6532.38s)]
*  I talk about rehabilitation a lot [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6534.38s)]
*  I cover primarily [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6536.38s)]
*  Labor related issues [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6538.38s)]
*  Politics in general [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6540.38s)]
*  And one of the things I talk about [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6542.38s)]
*  Quite a bit is [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6544.38s)]
*  How dog shit the American prison system is [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6546.38s)]
*  And how [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6548.38s)]
*  Prisoners demand more rights [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6550.38s)]
*  So [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6552.38s)]
*  One of the things that we have been talking about [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6554.38s)]
*  With the wildfires is that you guys [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6556.38s)]
*  Incarcerated wildfires [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6558.38s)]
*  There's actually a lot of people [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6560.38s)]
*  There's a lot of news coverage around what you guys do [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6562.38s)]
*  As a matter of fact [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6564.38s)]
*  And I hit up Scott [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6566.38s)]
*  And we were supposed [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6568.38s)]
*  To link up to something totally [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6570.38s)]
*  Different [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6572.38s)]
*  But one of my friends told me that he does this program [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6574.38s)]
*  And I thought it would be [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6576.38s)]
*  An amazing opportunity to come talk to you guys [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6578.38s)]
*  And to [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6580.38s)]
*  Show people outside [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6582.38s)]
*  That you're just normal dudes [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6584.38s)]
*  So you just now [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6586.38s)]
*  You've been out about it since you met us [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6588.38s)]
*  Y'all suck [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6590.38s)]
*  No, I mean nothing really changed [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6594.38s)]
*  From my perspective [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6596.38s)]
*  I don't know [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6598.38s)]
*  It's just [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6600.38s)]
*  You guys are just regular dudes [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6602.38s)]
*  But the way [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6604.38s)]
*  I think the way that a lot of people approach it [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6606.38s)]
*  They think like, oh someone has done a crime [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6608.38s)]
*  They're evil, they're automatically bad [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6610.38s)]
*  They're bad, they're scary [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6612.38s)]
*  And I want to break that stigma [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6614.38s)]
*  You know [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6616.38s)]
*  And show people that [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6618.38s)]
*  That's not the case [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6620.38s)]
*  And I feel like if they see, if they recognize your humanity [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6622.38s)]
*  A little bit, then they'll be more [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6624.38s)]
*  Open minded [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6626.38s)]
*  To initiatives [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6628.38s)]
*  That [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6630.38s)]
*  Initiatives that are helpful with reintegration [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6632.38s)]
*  Initiatives that are helpful with hiring [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6634.38s)]
*  You know, former inmates [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6636.38s)]
*  For sure [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6640.38s)]
*  And we appreciate you for that [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6642.38s)]
*  We gotta get you out of camp, groundless work [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6644.38s)]
*  I'm down, yeah [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6646.38s)]
*  I'll talk to you soon [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6648.38s)]
*  I'll talk to you out of it [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6650.38s)]
*  If we can make something like that happen, that would be great [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6652.38s)]
*  Let's do it [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6654.38s)]
*  Come check out my bunk, we'll make you a little spread [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6656.38s)]
*  Eat real quick [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6658.38s)]
*  We'll go on Twitch, you know [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6660.38s)]
*  Twitch, Twitch Cribs, there we go [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6662.38s)]
*  There is actually a thing, like there's a thing on TikTok [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6664.38s)]
*  Like prison food [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6666.38s)]
*  Where they show like different things that people make in prison [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6668.38s)]
*  So we can do something like that, like a little cooking segment [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6670.38s)]
*  You gotta make it though, you gotta make it [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6672.38s)]
*  I'll make it [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6674.38s)]
*  We'll tell you how to do it, you cook [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6676.38s)]
*  The only thing I know how to make is chicken, that's all I know how to make [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6678.38s)]
*  So I don't know [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6680.38s)]
*  We're gonna do something with that [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6682.38s)]
*  What do you guys make, what do you guys cook? [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6684.38s)]
*  You cook your own food? [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6686.38s)]
*  Everything, ice balls, burritos, nachos [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6688.38s)]
*  Sushi, tamales [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6690.38s)]
*  Everything [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6692.38s)]
*  We cook everything [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6694.38s)]
*  We got to go like [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6696.38s)]
*  So how does that work in [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6698.38s)]
*  How does that work in camp? [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6700.38s)]
*  Cause in prison it's like you got a chef [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6702.38s)]
*  Or not a chef, but like you got someone working [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6704.38s)]
*  In the kitchen [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6706.38s)]
*  Not a chef for sure [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6708.38s)]
*  You got someone over there [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6710.38s)]
*  Someone like you sitting there [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6712.38s)]
*  Whipping stuff up, but like in camp you make your own food? [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6714.38s)]
*  So it's kind of the same thing [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6716.38s)]
*  We have someone that cooks for us [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6718.38s)]
*  But we can also buy our own food from commissary [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6720.38s)]
*  We make food [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6722.38s)]
*  What do they have in commissary? [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6724.38s)]
*  Hot Cheetos, sausages [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6726.38s)]
*  How much is a hot cheeto in a commissary? [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6728.38s)]
*  $2.65 [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6730.38s)]
*  Oh ok so it's like normal price [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6732.38s)]
*  Cause I know phone calls [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6734.38s)]
*  I don't know how it is in California [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6736.38s)]
*  It's free now [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6738.38s)]
*  It used to be a big ass fucking problem [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6740.38s)]
*  That shit was awful [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6742.38s)]
*  So the phone calls are free now [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6744.38s)]
*  So everyone that left come back, I can call you now [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6746.38s)]
*  Wait, tell them what it used to be like [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6748.38s)]
*  So it used to be [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6750.38s)]
*  Like $2.33 a minute [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6752.38s)]
*  $0.33 a minute [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6754.38s)]
*  $100 a day [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6756.38s)]
*  Like $1.50 a phone call [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6758.38s)]
*  Which has been like $100 a week [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6760.38s)]
*  So that's why we're all single now [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6762.38s)]
*  Am I right? [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6764.38s)]
*  Just me [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6766.38s)]
*  Wait, ok so [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6768.38s)]
*  Why is that important? [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6770.38s)]
*  Why is it important that you have access to the outside world like that? [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6772.38s)]
*  We're just because [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6776.38s)]
*  We're not trying to get institutionalized [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6778.38s)]
*  We're not trying to get stu- [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6780.38s)]
*  We're still people like you said [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6788.38s)]
*  We're still people and we're still trying to strive [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6790.38s)]
*  We're still trying to grow and get out of what we're in [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6792.38s)]
*  Don't get me wrong, like what we're in [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6794.38s)]
*  It's a great environment with the people out there [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6796.38s)]
*  We surround ourselves with [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6798.38s)]
*  These people right here, I'm with them every day [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6800.38s)]
*  And they're helping me grow every single day, they're helping to challenge me [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6802.38s)]
*  It doesn't motivate me but it keeps me updated with the streets [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6804.38s)]
*  Hey, this is going on crypto [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6806.38s)]
*  You need to get your bank account up [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6808.38s)]
*  Like all these information that he can't give me [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6810.38s)]
*  Because he didn't experience that [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6812.38s)]
*  Don't do crypto bro, you're gonna lose all your money [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6814.38s)]
*  You'll see [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6816.38s)]
*  Oh my god bro [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6818.38s)]
*  Don't do it, I promise [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6820.38s)]
*  It's not a good idea [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6822.38s)]
*  You guys put me up on GAME ONE that day [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6824.38s)]
*  Oh my god [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6826.38s)]
*  No [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6828.38s)]
*  So what would you suggest again? [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6830.38s)]
*  Don't gamble bro, don't gamble [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6832.38s)]
*  Unless you're going for the 49ers [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6834.38s)]
*  Go ahead [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6836.38s)]
*  What I would suggest is [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6838.38s)]
*  Trying to get a decent wage job [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6840.38s)]
*  Work a job [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6844.38s)]
*  Pay rent [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6846.38s)]
*  Live a decent life [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6848.38s)]
*  There's a lot of people [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6850.38s)]
*  Who don't go to prison [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6852.38s)]
*  Who also lose a shit ton of money [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6854.38s)]
*  Doing crypto [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6856.38s)]
*  And gambling and all this stuff [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6858.38s)]
*  It's not good [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6860.38s)]
*  We see so without connection to the world [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6862.38s)]
*  I wouldn't know this [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6864.38s)]
*  So now I'm just thinking I'm going right into crypto [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6866.38s)]
*  But look, we need more connection with the world now [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6868.38s)]
*  No, you need less connection with the world [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6870.38s)]
*  You're trying to make crypto puts [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6872.38s)]
*  You're trying to make calls [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6874.38s)]
*  How's the crypto doing? [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6876.38s)]
*  What's going on over there? [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6878.38s)]
*  Okay, so I asked some of the other guys [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6880.38s)]
*  This question, I was wondering [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6882.38s)]
*  What do you think? Out of four qualities of the program that you're in [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6884.38s)]
*  Which one do you think is the most significant for you? [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6888.38s)]
*  You got time reduced [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6892.38s)]
*  You got conditions in the camp as opposed to prison [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6894.38s)]
*  Which are significantly more humane [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6898.38s)]
*  You got a job so you're busy [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6902.38s)]
*  And I forgot what the fourth thing was [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6904.38s)]
*  What the fuck was it? [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6906.38s)]
*  Out of those three, what do you think is the most significant? [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6908.38s)]
*  Time reduced [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6910.38s)]
*  I'm trying to go home [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6914.38s)]
*  I feel like a lot of us we got over sent [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6916.38s)]
*  Especially for the project we committed [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6918.38s)]
*  For sure [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6920.38s)]
*  It's giving us a chance to go home early [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6922.38s)]
*  You guys are also young offenders, right? [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6924.38s)]
*  Yeah, so we're not supposed to be here [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6926.38s)]
*  Of course, someone probably already told you that [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6928.38s)]
*  We're not supposed to be at Camp Blyton [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6930.38s)]
*  Because Scott Blyton, shout out Scott [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6932.38s)]
*  You're number one, man [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6934.38s)]
*  We're here [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6936.38s)]
*  We're very grateful [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6938.38s)]
*  If you don't mind me asking [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6942.38s)]
*  What do you think in your mind [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6944.38s)]
*  In your assessment from all the people that you've met [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6946.38s)]
*  In prison, in camp [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6948.38s)]
*  What do you think is like a [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6950.38s)]
*  Leading reason for how you [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6952.38s)]
*  Land up in prison? [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6954.38s)]
*  The leading reason [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6956.38s)]
*  Like what is it? [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6958.38s)]
*  For me I would say no college [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6960.38s)]
*  No college, no college [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6962.38s)]
*  For me I was like left at home [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6964.38s)]
*  I just started running the streets that I got made [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6966.38s)]
*  So it led me to the big one [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6968.38s)]
*  Where are you from originally? San Diego [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6970.38s)]
*  Okay [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6972.38s)]
*  That led me to like this [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6974.38s)]
*  Start running the streets that I got made [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6976.38s)]
*  I would say [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6978.38s)]
*  Kind of touch on the same thing [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6980.38s)]
*  No guidance, just not having a positive [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6982.38s)]
*  Guidance of the environment that [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6984.38s)]
*  I grew up in [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6986.38s)]
*  Of course it led me into a different direction [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6988.38s)]
*  What about you? [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6990.38s)]
*  So first off, obviously there's no [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6992.38s)]
*  Excuses to what I'm saying, right? [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6994.38s)]
*  I've called myself accountable for what I've done, right? [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6996.38s)]
*  I'm not the commissioner board [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=6998.38s)]
*  There's circumstances, right? [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7000.38s)]
*  No, I feel you [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7002.38s)]
*  My mental health, my insecurities [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7004.38s)]
*  I didn't have no one I could talk to [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7006.38s)]
*  The schools I was in [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7008.38s)]
*  They didn't really teach me how to behave [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7010.38s)]
*  They were favoritism towards different races [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7012.38s)]
*  And ethnicity [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7014.38s)]
*  And I think that made me go different ways [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7016.38s)]
*  With social groups, so I couldn't really fit in with nobody [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7018.38s)]
*  So I had to branch out to different people [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7020.38s)]
*  That's what made me think in my times [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7022.38s)]
*  To find different people that had the same values as me [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7024.38s)]
*  Which is violence [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7026.38s)]
*  Okay [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7028.38s)]
*  What got you locked up? [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7034.38s)]
*  I got put in a bad situation [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7040.38s)]
*  A messed up situation [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7042.38s)]
*  But, I mean, that was part of it [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7044.38s)]
*  But, just [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7046.38s)]
*  I would say the way I was living [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7048.38s)]
*  Really is what [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7050.38s)]
*  Led me here [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7052.38s)]
*  Trying to find [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7054.38s)]
*  Love in the streets [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7056.38s)]
*  Love that I wasn't at home [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7058.38s)]
*  And once I fell back into [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7060.38s)]
*  My bad habits again [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7062.38s)]
*  Carrying guns again [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7064.38s)]
*  And [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7066.38s)]
*  Led me to do the dumb things [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7068.38s)]
*  And I went and had that gun that night [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7070.38s)]
*  And I ordered probably stuff now [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7072.38s)]
*  How much time you got? [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7078.38s)]
*  Right now, my out day target is 2026 [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7080.38s)]
*  I'm trying to get my GD [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7082.38s)]
*  To get some more time off [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7084.38s)]
*  I'm hoping to get home by like December this year [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7086.38s)]
*  Okay [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7088.38s)]
*  What would you say is [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7090.38s)]
*  How do you like campus [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7092.38s)]
*  Compared to prison? [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7094.38s)]
*  Camp compared to prison? [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7096.38s)]
*  I love camp, I'll take camp over prison any day [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7098.38s)]
*  Tell me about your first hike [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7100.38s)]
*  My first [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7102.38s)]
*  I got to camp on a Monday [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7104.38s)]
*  My second day we went out to work [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7106.38s)]
*  I'm like cutting trees and stuff [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7108.38s)]
*  And then Wednesday the next day after that [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7110.38s)]
*  We did this hike called a rocket ship [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7112.38s)]
*  They say it's like one of the worst hikes [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7114.38s)]

*  These guys haven't showered in like 4 days [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7760.38s)]
*  So just stuff like that [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7762.38s)]
*  And then I think also [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7764.38s)]
*  When they get out, if they want to work for Cal Fire [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7766.38s)]
*  As soon as they get out, how are they going to pay rent [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7768.38s)]
*  To wherever they're getting hired [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7770.38s)]
*  How are they going to pay utilities [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7772.38s)]
*  What about a car to get to and from work [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7774.38s)]
*  To get a scholarship fund [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7776.38s)]
*  To help them when they get out [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7778.38s)]
*  A lot of people have talked about how [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7780.38s)]
*  Reintegration, one of the biggest problems [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7782.38s)]
*  Is getting a job [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7784.38s)]
*  In general [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7786.38s)]
*  Keeping up with parole [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7788.38s)]
*  And from what I've heard [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7790.38s)]
*  It's just like [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7792.38s)]
*  Having something that keeps them grounded [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7794.38s)]
*  And busy and look forward to [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7796.38s)]
*  Is a major [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7798.38s)]
*  Impact [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7800.38s)]
*  I think you nailed it [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7802.38s)]
*  What like [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7804.38s)]
*  The work ethic this gives them too [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7806.38s)]
*  These guys are fucking beasts [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7808.38s)]
*  We were hearing stories [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7810.38s)]
*  About, and they were all swapping [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7812.38s)]
*  Stories too, what they are doing [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7814.38s)]
*  Out here is [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7816.38s)]
*  It's so physically demanding and how hard [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7818.38s)]
*  They're going to run circles, whatever job they get out here [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7820.38s)]
*  If they don't do fire, they're going to run circles around everyone [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7822.38s)]
*  The work ethic is the same, right [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7824.38s)]
*  So these guys are insanely hireable [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7826.38s)]
*  And now because of a bill we [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7828.38s)]
*  ARC did, they can now expunge the record [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7830.38s)]
*  So they don't have to check the I'm a felon box [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7832.38s)]
*  They're no longer a felon [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7834.38s)]
*  Because they risked their life [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7836.38s)]
*  To save our state [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7838.38s)]
*  Which they did last night and they'll be doing tomorrow night [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7840.38s)]
*  So while we're sleeping in our bed [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7842.38s)]
*  They're up all night long on the mountain [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7844.38s)]
*  Yeah, and they were [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7846.38s)]
*  Saying they pretty much just have what is on them [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7848.38s)]
*  Like there's no, there's nothing [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7850.38s)]
*  By the way, those subway sandwiches [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7852.38s)]
*  And stuff that we just delivered [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7854.38s)]
*  I'm sure they'll be sneaking those in their packs [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7856.38s)]
*  So at 3 in the morning after they've been working for [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7858.38s)]
*  20 hours [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7860.38s)]
*  They get to take a bite [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7862.38s)]
*  Dude, how did you get involved? [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7864.38s)]
*  How long have you been involved? [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7866.38s)]
*  I was just like, I was doing [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7868.38s)]
*  Old school, do you remember that one? [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7870.38s)]
*  Or too young for old school? [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7872.38s)]
*  Will Ferrell running street? [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7874.38s)]
*  I was doing old school and I met a guy that said [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7876.38s)]
*  Come down to juvenile law in the San Fernando [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7878.38s)]
*  Valley and come be in this creative [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7880.38s)]
*  Writing program and I went down [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7882.38s)]
*  And the first kid I met [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7884.38s)]
*  No exaggeration, I'm like how was your day? [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7886.38s)]
*  He said it was a really tough day [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7888.38s)]
*  I just got 300 years of life in prison [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7890.38s)]
*  And I looked at him, he was little [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7892.38s)]
*  With a little mohawk on his head [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7894.38s)]
*  He said I'm 15 years old [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7896.38s)]
*  And he got 300 years of life in prison [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7898.38s)]
*  And I'm like, what did you do? [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7900.38s)]
*  In my mind I'm thinking is this kid like Charles Manson? [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7902.38s)]
*  What did he do? [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7904.38s)]
*  He's like, I stood next to my homie [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7906.38s)]
*  Who shot the victim in the butt [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7908.38s)]
*  The victim was in and out of the hospital in a day [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7910.38s)]
*  And for standing next to the guy with the gun [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7912.38s)]
*  And never touching the gun, I got 300 years of life [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7914.38s)]
*  And in my mind I'm like [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7916.38s)]
*  Maybe there's some punishment for that [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7918.38s)]
*  I don't think any of us would say [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7920.38s)]
*  300 years of life is proportionate [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7922.38s)]
*  For a 15 year old [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7924.38s)]
*  I did a lot [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7926.38s)]
*  I did a lot of dumb shit [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7928.38s)]
*  When I was in my early 20s [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7930.38s)]
*  And if that was my kid, he'd be out on bail [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7932.38s)]
*  He wouldn't be sitting in that juvenile hall [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7934.38s)]
*  And he'd have the best lawyer in LA [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7936.38s)]
*  And for not shooting somebody he would probably get probation [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7938.38s)]
*  Looks like me, has my money [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7940.38s)]
*  Has a good lawyer, resources fine [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7942.38s)]
*  But David was going to prison for 300 years of life [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7944.38s)]
*  And so like that got me [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7946.38s)]
*  I started getting into it [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7948.38s)]
*  Learned how to pass laws in Sacramento [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7950.38s)]
*  Ended up passing a law called Senate Bill 260 [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7952.38s)]
*  That let any kid under the age of 18 [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7954.38s)]
*  Who got a life sentence [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7956.38s)]
*  Go to the parole board at 15, 20, or 25 years [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7958.38s)]
*  So David got reduced from 300 to life [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7960.38s)]
*  To 25 to life [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7962.38s)]
*  Got his college degree, mentored people [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7964.38s)]
*  And then the governor commuted his sentence [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7966.38s)]
*  And he's home now [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7968.38s)]
*  And raising two twin daughters [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7970.38s)]
*  It's awesome, but it's like [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7972.38s)]
*  In our business, like in what I do [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7974.38s)]
*  I meet so many people that are just like [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7976.38s)]
*  So self-centered [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7978.38s)]
*  And narcissistic [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7980.38s)]
*  Being around people like this [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7982.38s)]
*  Who all they want to do is give back [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7984.38s)]
*  And they want to redeem themselves from what got them here [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7986.38s)]
*  I find it very beautiful [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7988.38s)]
*  I think even just asking [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7990.38s)]
*  You asking that David [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7992.38s)]
*  How are you, how's your day, you know? [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7994.38s)]
*  It's like just starting there [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7996.38s)]
*  And caring, right? [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=7998.38s)]
*  And you see this person as a human being [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8000.38s)]
*  And the conversations [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8002.38s)]
*  That I was having with all these guys [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8004.38s)]
*  Is they [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8006.38s)]
*  They keep being like [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8008.38s)]
*  I don't mean this the wrong way, but like why do you guys [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8010.38s)]
*  Why are you here? [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8012.38s)]
*  What are you guys doing here? Why do you care about us? [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8014.38s)]
*  Isn't that sad? They don't think people care [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8016.38s)]
*  So they see a night like tonight [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8018.38s)]
*  I know, and I think right now [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8020.38s)]
*  With disasters like this [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8022.38s)]
*  It's a huge moment [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8024.38s)]
*  To raise awareness, right? Cause people are [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8026.38s)]
*  Like, okay, I want to help [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8028.38s)]
*  I want to feel collective action [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8030.38s)]
*  I want to be in solidarity [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8032.38s)]
*  And it's like, let this moment radicalize you [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8034.38s)]
*  In a good way, right? [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8036.38s)]
*  Don't fall prey to like [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8038.38s)]
*  Misinformation, to individualism [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8040.38s)]
*  Let this [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8042.38s)]
*  To me it's like the misinformation piece [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8044.38s)]
*  It's like people like [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8046.38s)]
*  Using this for like political hits and shit like that [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8048.38s)]
*  When like you guys are showing up and like [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8050.38s)]
*  Showing love [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8052.38s)]
*  And being here for these guys and other people just want to use it [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8054.38s)]
*  But that is radical [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8056.38s)]
*  For a lot of people that is, you know, radical empathy [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8058.38s)]
*  It's like, radical sounds so intense [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8060.38s)]
*  Right? It's like an intense word [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8062.38s)]
*  But it is truly seeing these people as human beings [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8064.38s)]
*  There is fundamentally [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8066.38s)]
*  No difference between [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8068.38s)]
*  Any of the dudes I just met today [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8070.38s)]
*  And myself, with the most [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8072.38s)]
*  Important exception, I come from a more affluent background [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8074.38s)]
*  And therefore [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8076.38s)]
*  When I fucked up I had a support network to rely on [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8078.38s)]
*  I had my family that could set me straight [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8080.38s)]
*  And I always recognize that [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8082.38s)]
*  That [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8084.38s)]
*  That privilege that I have [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8086.38s)]
*  And I try to explain to other people [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8088.38s)]
*  That like, you know [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8090.38s)]
*  Other people that are watching [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8092.38s)]
*  These guys are, yeah, maybe some of them just [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8094.38s)]
*  Stuff that you would consider to be [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8096.38s)]
*  Ridiculous or crazy or whatever but it doesn't matter [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8098.38s)]
*  Like, everyone has the capacity to [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8100.38s)]
*  Rehabilitate, everyone has the capacity [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8102.38s)]
*  To become a better, more productive member of society [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8104.38s)]
*  The thing I love the most about this [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8106.38s)]
*  Is you go from like [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8108.38s)]
*  The pariah of the community [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8110.38s)]
*  Like we want to separate you because you're too dangerous [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8112.38s)]
*  And get out of our community [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8114.38s)]
*  And now all of a sudden you're a first responder [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8116.38s)]
*  You're a hero [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8118.38s)]
*  People are baking you brownies and cookies [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8120.38s)]
*  Because you're going up in a mountain [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8122.38s)]
*  And fighting a fire so it doesn't kill our community [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8124.38s)]
*  I think it's [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8126.38s)]
*  But I think, yeah, you're right [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8128.38s)]
*  The dignity aspect of it [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8130.38s)]
*  Is huge and I feel like [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8132.38s)]
*  That's another thing I want to do [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8134.38s)]
*  If we can do this, because they were talking about [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8136.38s)]
*  Going back to camp [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8138.38s)]
*  I think we could potentially film the camp at some point [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8140.38s)]
*  No, no, we go [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8142.38s)]
*  As soon as they're back, let's go [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8144.38s)]
*  Okay, that's a great idea, I want to do that 100% [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8146.38s)]
*  Because I think [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8148.38s)]
*  From what I see [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8150.38s)]
*  This is like one of the closest aspects [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8152.38s)]
*  To a more rehabilitative approach [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8154.38s)]
*  In like the American [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8156.38s)]
*  Castle structure [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8158.38s)]
*  Because like, one of the things that everybody [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8160.38s)]
*  Talked about, and across age groups [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8162.38s)]
*  From different camps, everyone was like [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8164.38s)]
*  There's no racialized, like [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8166.38s)]
*  There's no race stuff [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8168.38s)]
*  Everyone is the same, nobody rocks the boat [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8170.38s)]
*  Because you get all of these [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8172.38s)]
*  Positive incentives of [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8174.38s)]
*  Sense reduction, but more importantly [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8176.38s)]
*  Than that, the conditions in the camp [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8178.38s)]
*  Are significantly better than prison [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8180.38s)]
*  And by the way [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8182.38s)]
*  That doesn't mean it's actually [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8184.38s)]
*  Better than your living conditions [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8186.38s)]
*  At home [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8188.38s)]
*  They also don't have [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8190.38s)]
*  They don't have internet, they don't have internet access [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8192.380000000001s)]
*  Unless it's supervised [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8194.380000000001s)]
*  But, I think that plays a major role [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8196.38s)]
*  In people feeling like human beings [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8198.38s)]
*  And it helps with reintegration in general [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8200.38s)]
*  100% [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8202.38s)]
*  David, David [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8204.38s)]
*  Get Jersey, bring him over here please [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8206.38s)]
*  You both of you [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8208.38s)]
*  This is an incredible story, I'm going to try to tell you this story [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8210.38s)]
*  You'll love this [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8212.38s)]
*  I think like [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8214.38s)]
*  I was on your live stream as you were driving [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8216.38s)]
*  And I saw a lot of people commenting about modern day slavery [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8218.38s)]
*  And I'll say this [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8220.38s)]
*  It's like [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8222.38s)]
*  Well, I'm running like a massive campaign right now [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8224.38s)]
*  With [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8226.38s)]
*  Governor Newsom and others [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8228.38s)]
*  Trying to get him to raise the pay [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8230.38s)]
*  Because I agree that the pay [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8232.38s)]
*  It's been a dollar an hour [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8234.38s)]
*  Since 1984 [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8236.38s)]
*  That's unacceptable [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8238.38s)]
*  So there was a [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8240.38s)]
*  There was an actual legislative proposal this year [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8242.38s)]
*  To go from a dollar an hour to five dollars an hour [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8244.38s)]
*  And it got killed [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8246.38s)]
*  So this year I want to accomplish that [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8248.38s)]
*  But like no one's forced to be here [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8250.38s)]
*  This is voluntary [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8252.38s)]
*  And it's now [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8254.38s)]
*  Five years ago there was no path to a career [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8256.38s)]
*  You risked your life, you got paid nothing [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8258.38s)]
*  You got out and it's like no we won't hire you [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8260.38s)]
*  Now there's a path to a hundred thousand dollar a year job [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8262.38s)]
*  And I tell these guys like [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8264.38s)]
*  Who cares what you get paid [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8266.38s)]
*  Volunteer to get out of a prison cell [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8268.38s)]
*  Save people's life [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8270.38s)]
*  Make amends, redeem yourself [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8272.38s)]
*  For the shit you've done [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8274.38s)]
*  Even if you're volunteering you get paid nothing [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8276.38s)]
*  And I'm going to do everything I can [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8278.38s)]
*  And you have a career where you can make a hundred, hundred fifty, two hundred thousand dollars a year [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8280.38s)]
*  So your kids never have to go through [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8282.38s)]
*  What you went through and then go to a great private school [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8284.38s)]
*  And a great college, right? [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8286.38s)]
*  And so like I really love the bill [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8288.38s)]
*  Five years ago maybe it was [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8290.38s)]
*  More like that [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8292.38s)]
*  Today not so much [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8294.38s)]
*  Can you give any update on where a bill like that is? [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8296.38s)]
*  I think it's going to be more like [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8300.38s)]
*  You can go the bill route or you can go a budget route [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8304.38s)]
*  The budget process starts now in January [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8306.38s)]
*  The governor released his budget this week [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8308.38s)]
*  And then they close the budget in June [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8310.38s)]
*  And it becomes a state budget [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8312.38s)]
*  So between now and June [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8314.38s)]
*  Is when he will either force his department of finance to do it [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8316.38s)]
*  Or not do it [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8318.38s)]
*  And the governor was here tonight [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8320.38s)]
*  I'll sing his praises if he does [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8322.38s)]
*  Yeah [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8324.38s)]
*  That's right [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8326.38s)]
*  I'll tell you this [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8328.38s)]
*  He really in terms of fire stuff [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8330.38s)]
*  He's done incredible [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8332.38s)]
*  No governor in the last 30, 40 years [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8334.38s)]
*  Has doubled Cal Fire's budget [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8336.38s)]
*  2 billion when he came in, 4 billion now [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8338.38s)]
*  7,000 firefighters there, 14,000 now [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8340.38s)]
*  Like he's doing it [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8342.38s)]
*  I want to tell you a quick story [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8344.38s)]
*  Where's combos? [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8346.38s)]
*  Get combos [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8348.38s)]
*  Stop talking, get over here [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8350.38s)]
*  Okay, this is a great story [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8352.38s)]
*  So this guy right here was my student in Somar Juvenile Hall [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8354.38s)]
*  When he was 14 years old [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8356.38s)]

*  On specifically this issue [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8570.38s)]
*  This is something that I think is [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8572.38s)]
*  Unfortunately an area [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8574.38s)]
*  Where a lot of people just [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8576.38s)]
*  Don't ever even encounter [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8578.38s)]
*  Like don't even brush the subject matter [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8580.38s)]
*  With like any dignity whatsoever [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8582.38s)]
*  Everybody just writes off prisoners [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8584.38s)]
*  They don't ever talk about them, they don't ever think about them [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8586.38s)]
*  They want more [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8588.38s)]
*  They don't want [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8590.38s)]
*  They don't want to reduce sentences, they want to make sure [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8592.38s)]
*  That people stay in prison for as long as possible [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8594.38s)]
*  Without ever thinking about it [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8596.38s)]
*  And I think showing the camp conditions specifically [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8598.38s)]
*  As juxtaposed with like [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8600.38s)]
*  What county jail looks like, what prison looks like [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8602.38s)]
*  And how much [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8604.38s)]
*  That helps people feel human [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8606.38s)]
*  And how successful that is [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8608.38s)]
*  In terms of like [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8610.38s)]
*  Rehabilitating people and allowing [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8612.38s)]
*  That integration to happen [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8614.38s)]
*  Is really huge [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8616.38s)]
*  This part, this is a major aspect [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8618.38s)]
*  We'll go there, we'll shoot it, it'll be great [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8620.38s)]
*  I think also right now you know [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8622.38s)]
*  As we said a lot of people are very like [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8624.38s)]

*  And it's about like [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8636.38s)]
*  What happens after [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8638.38s)]
*  You know it's not just like now but also when they get out [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkJYGZge4I&t=8640.38s)]
