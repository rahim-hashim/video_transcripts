# Reason For The Official Cease Fire | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ)
*  No, it's not a false flag. Guys, the ceasefire hasn't been finalized yet. Iran still has, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Iran still has like a four and a half hours to retaliate against Israel. And this is Iraq anyway. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=7.28s)]
*  Israel's channel 12 reports that Prime Minister Netanyahu instructed ministers at the end of a [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=14.96s)]
*  four-hour cabinet meeting not to comment on the latest developments until further notice. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=18.56s)]
*  They also, I think, have drafted a withdrawal. Iran, I think, drafted a withdrawal from leaving [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=21.92s)]
*  the International Atomic Agency Energy. So that's a ginormous L for everybody except for Iran. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=35.040000000000006s)]
*  U.S. interests as well in this with those launched in Qatar hours ago. Out front now, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=43.040000000000006s)]
*  Senator Chris Murphy of the Foreign Relations Committee. And Senator Murphy, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=48.56s)]
*  so Trump says there's this complete and total ceasefire. We have, it seems to be, you know, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=51.92s)]
*  muzzling out of Israel, right? They're not talking, which would indicate, as Jeremy says, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=58.24s)]
*  perhaps something. Explosions in Tehran, but neither side speaking. Is this ceasefire real? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=61.440000000000005s)]
*  Well, I have no idea. I mean, what we know is that Donald Trump doesn't tell the truth a lot, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=67.76s)]
*  so you can't rely on Donald Trump's statements. And frankly, you can't rely on what Iran says [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=71.6s)]
*  either. Remember, Iran may agree that it's not going to launch direct attacks against Israel or [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=77.84s)]
*  the United States, but Iran traditionally exercises power, lethal power through its proxies. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=84.08s)]
*  Its proxies inside Lebanon, its proxies inside Iraq. And so this is still going to be a very [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  dangerous moment. Let's hope that this is a ceasefire that is real. Let's hope that this is [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  an end, at least temporarily, to the hostilities. But let's also understand that Iran has agreed to [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  a lot of things over the years because of the way in which it uses these groups, which are spread out [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=107.91999999999999s)]
*  all across the region that are very close to U.S. forces. Anything official out of Tehran probably [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=112.96s)]
*  isn't worth much more than the paper that it's written on. Well, I mean, of course, you're also [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=118.96s)]
*  in the context of, we understand the Ayatollah is in a bunker because Netanyahu said he could take [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  him out at any time. And Trump has talked about regime change. So does that mean that that's all [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=126.88s)]
*  over regime changes off the table? I mean, I'm only saying this in the context of some things are [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=132.16s)]
*  impossible to put back in the bottle. Sometimes when people show you who they are, they've shown [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=136.48s)]
*  you who they are. And it seems that we have passed such a... Yeah, I think this assessment from [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=140.07999999999998s)]
*  Seamus is not entirely correct. The reason why I say this is because Iran does not have the smoke. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=144.4s)]
*  They've shown that time and time again, they do not want further war. They do not want [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=150.56s)]
*  they do not want more b****** campaigns in Tehran, no matter what. That's it. As I said, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=157.28s)]
*  as I said from the start, that any off ramp that America gives to Iran, Iran will take. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=164.64s)]
*  And they did. Any off ramp. Range. This might get worse for the United States, not better. So, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=173.51999999999998s)]
*  you know, we still don't even have all the facts to know how impactful this strike was, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  but it certainly is going to alter the calculus of the Iranian regime. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=184.16s)]
*  Right. And of course, the ceasefire is a pause, a pause to I mean, we hear obviously leveled in [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=187.92s)]
*  the Ukraine all the time would be a pause to rebuild. But to your point about this enrichment, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=192.88s)]
*  the vice president, J.D. Van... Iran has been 100% within their rights under international law. Oh, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=198.72s)]
*  100%. Yeah, Chris Murphy is out of his mind for stating this is just a complete [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=202.64s)]
*  distortion of the truth. Highly enriched uranium is located, right? I mean, do they know they [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  destroyed it? Do they even know where it is? Right. Here's how he answered the question. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=210.32s)]
*  I think that's actually not the question before us. The question ran enrich the uranium to... [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=216.0s)]
*  There's a bomb threat near the White House. And I do think the uranium is buried, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=221.35999999999999s)]
*  but our goal was to eliminate the enrichment and eliminate their ability to convert that [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=226.56s)]
*  enriched fuel into a nuclear weapon. So Senator, he very clearly did not say that he knew where [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=231.51999999999998s)]
*  the uranium was, which would mean that obviously that would flow from there to not know how much [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=235.92s)]
*  there was or its state. You know, do you think that we know what we need to know here? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=240.88s)]
*  Okay. The old man is doing the rounds on the media again. He's calling the journalists again. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=247.67999999999998s)]
*  President Trump spoke to me about the ceasefire deal in an exclusive interview. He said, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=252.32s)]
*  is a great day for America is a great day for the Middle East. I'm very happy to have been [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=255.35999999999999s)]
*  able to get the job done. A lot of people were dying and it was only going to get worse. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=259.2s)]
*  When asked how long the ceasefire would be, president Trump said, I think the ceasefire [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=262.71999999999997s)]
*  is unlimited. It's going to go forever. When asked if there was completely over, he said, yes, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=265.28s)]
*  I don't believe they were, they will ever be shooting at each other again. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=269.44s)]
*  President Trump also said that of the conflict with Iran, it would have brought the whole [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=272.64s)]
*  Middle East down. He added this about the ceasefire deal is a wonderful day for the world. In my [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=276.0s)]
*  opinion. Okay. I need to make something clear here. Here was a really cool way that Trump [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=280.55999999999995s)]
*  could have avoided all of this telling Israel not to strike a rock on, because we have [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=287.03999999999996s)]
*  only at best set the timeframe back. Yeah. Frame drops. I know. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=295.04s)]
*  We have only set the timeframe back to 12 days ago and there's been a lot in those 12 days. That's [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=303.12s)]
*  bad for both Iran and Israel. So this is not a W why are people who that would look at this and go, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=310.8s)]
*  that's cool. This is actually really dope. Unless somehow this also through back channels is [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=319.04s)]
*  telling Israel to just cut it out with Gaza or some shit, which I heavily doubt. There was no W [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=327.28000000000003s)]
*  here at all. Trump allowed this event to unfold. He created chaos. People were like, this is the [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=333.20000000000005s)]
*  worst type of chaos. What the are you doing? And then 12 days later, he was like, all right, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=341.28000000000003s)]
*  chaos over. Look, I saved it. It's like, but you started it. You let the chaos happen. You [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=346.48s)]
*  let the chaos happen for 12 days only to turn around. And I guess like stop even more chaos [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=352.88s)]
*  from taking place. Like, how was this a W? This is the same principle behind the tariff stuff. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=361.52000000000004s)]
*  Like this is the same shit. Oh, I'm going to do maximum tariffs. Okay, I'm not going to do [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=366.72s)]
*  maximum tariffs. Oh, you're brilliant, sir. Thank you so much. How many more times does this have [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=371.44s)]
*  to happen? I see this the only way I, what I feel like took place is Israel's air defenses are [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=376.4s)]
*  diminished. And we'll see if Iran actually retaliates in this last barrage of, we'll see [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=385.2s)]
*  how much the Israeli air defenses are diminished. Okay. But if the only thing I can foresee happening [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=392.15999999999997s)]
*  here is that Israel's air defense, air defenses were so diminished and America did not have [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=400.08s)]
*  appetite for further with Iran. And therefore, I guess they had to, they had to cool off a little [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=404.0s)]
*  bit before they could re up on their air defenses. And then Israel will most likely try it again. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=412.24s)]
*  What does this mean? Israel told the U S first we strike only after a victory. Can the right [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=421.28s)]
*  agreement follow that was IDF's approach with Hezbollah and Lebanon. And now again, with Iran, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=427.92s)]
*  it appears to work for the second time. What is it all just fake news to distract people from the [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=431.6s)]
*  fact that ISIS deporting people? No, that's that's secondary. That has nothing. The distraction stuff [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=437.6s)]
*  is so silly. Cause like, this is a severe escalation. Like world three cannot be a [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=442.72s)]
*  distraction from ice deportations. You know what I mean? And now there's several large explosion [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=448.96000000000004s)]
*  being reported in Taji, north of Baghdad radar equipment in the U S base in Taji camp were [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=455.20000000000005s)]
*  destroyed with drones. No, it's not a false flag guys. The ceasefire hasn't been finalized yet. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=460.72s)]
*  Iran still has the Iran still has like a four and a half hours to retaliate against retaliate [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=468.48s)]
*  against Israel. And this is Iraq anyway, Israel's channel 12 reports that Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=476.72s)]
*  instructed ministers at the end of a four hour cabinet meeting not to comment on the latest [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=481.12s)]
*  developments until further notice. Aren't you proud of your proud of our country you live here, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=484.24s)]
*  dude? And Iran was gearing up to build hooks and their government hates America. What more do you [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=488.4s)]
*  need? No, I'm not proud of my country. Why would I be proud of my country? These past 12 days were [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=492.96s)]
*  not a moment of pride. It was a shameful experience. More than 600 Iranians until this last batch of [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=500.96s)]
*  bombings took place. More than 600 Iranians were killed, thousands injured. On the Israel side, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=510.64s)]
*  25 plus Israelis were killed, hundreds injured. Some of them were, you know, having panic attacks, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=518.96s)]
*  which the Israeli government considers an injury. And none of that had to happen at all. Because [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=524.96s)]
*  what you think was Iran gearing up to build was just a lie that you decided to believe. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=531.36s)]
*  They did not. If anything, they might now, they probably won't because they are, like I said, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=538.08s)]
*  restrained to a fault, but they weren't before as a panic attack. Havre do not be ableist. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=545.36s)]
*  I'm sorry. You cannot consider casualties. You cannot add panic attacks into the number of [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=550.8000000000001s)]
*  casualties. Okay. Yeah. It's really up when bombs are flying overhead, you're going to have a panic [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=558.6400000000001s)]
*  attack. Many people will. That's insane. That's an insane way to do stat padding. There's like [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=565.04s)]
*  children whose legs are chopped off or stuck under the rubble and will never be the same again. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=570.24s)]
*  And you're adding someone having a panic attack into that number. Because that's what a casualty [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=576.9599999999999s)]
*  is. Casualty numbers are like, you know, people that have been severely, gravely injured, almost, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=583.52s)]
*  I mean, they didn't die, but they almost died. Are you saying that Iran had no intention of [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=591.68s)]
*  obtaining a nuclear bomb? Iran has imperialist agendas too? I don't care if Iran has imperialist [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=595.3599999999999s)]
*  agendas or not. There is no intelligence that shows that Iran was on the verge of making a nuclear [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=600.56s)]
*  weapon. There's none. It's just made up. And they didn't even do a good job making it up. So I don't [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=609.12s)]
*  understand where you're coming from. Like this is, this is what's so frustrating about this process [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=616.0799999999999s)]
*  is that it's not like the American government even had like a Colin Powell moment. Like they [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=620.72s)]
*  didn't even like go on the national stage with like a trustworthy individual and go to the UN [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=625.44s)]
*  and be like, we have serious information that they have n****s or anything like that. They just [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=632.32s)]
*  basically were like, yeah, it's believe them. That's it. That's it. Like they didn't even try [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=636.64s)]
*  hard and motherf**kers are still believing in it. That's what, that's what's so crazy about it. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=642.48s)]
*  Marco Rubio literally on national television said, it doesn't matter if Iran is making nukes or not. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=650.8000000000001s)]
*  No, it does matter. That's the most important part of this. Reports are now suggesting that [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=656.24s)]
*  surface to air missile launcher and radar, sorry, were targeted and are now burning at Camp Taji on [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=661.36s)]
*  the north of the Iraqi capital of Baghdad. Is this the America hating Twitch stream? No, this is the [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=665.2s)]
*  actual America loving Twitch stream. I want America to do better. I want America to do better for you, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=671.44s)]
*  dumbf**k. Like I'm doing all right. If anything, I want America to do right by you. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=676.4s)]
*  And it's so weird to me that motherf**kers that are having a tough go at it are just like sitting [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=683.36s)]
*  around posturing angrily and going, no, you don't understand. I don't deserve healthcare. I'm a c**k. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=688.8s)]
*  I don't deserve healthcare. Every, every dollar should go to Israel. Like what is this? Like do [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=694.56s)]
*  you have no, do you have no dignity? Do you have no interest? Do you have no self-preservation skills? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=700.72s)]
*  I don't get it. Why are you yelling at me? It makes no sense. What is this? Iran's Ayatollah [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=706.48s)]
*  reportedly in a bunker, refused to surrender. He is currently the head of the judiciary. He's been very [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=711.04s)]
*  aligned with the IRGC for a number of years. So he's very conservative. What is happening on CNN? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=716.32s)]
*  Viewed as the security candidate. He's 68 years old. And the third is Mohsen Araki. He's a former [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=722.48s)]
*  religious advisor to the Supreme leader. He would be viewed as kind of a traditionalist candidate and [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=729.04s)]
*  really putting more emphasis on the religious legitimacy of the regime. I think it's important [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=735.76s)]
*  to appreciate that all of these gentlemen are about my age. They're in their 60s, upper 60s here, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=741.2s)]
*  and they were all young men, 20, 21 years old when the revolution took place back in 1979. So they've [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=748.24s)]
*  seen this through that lens for the bulk of their adult lives. And I think are all very much committed [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=756.4s)]
*  to the same principles that the current Supreme leader is. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=762.48s)]
*  A continuation of that change. The Ayatollah son was once on top of the list, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=770.4s)]
*  but according to the New York Times, no longer on it. What do you think of that? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=773.9200000000001s)]
*  Well, I think- What do they know that we don't know? Is this, are they just like wish casting? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=778.32s)]
*  Like what's happening? Is there a coup? Because he didn't necessarily like the idea of family's, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=784.24s)]
*  family ruling here. So I think he kind of excluded him. Another candidate that was mentioned, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=791.6800000000001s)]
*  of course, was Hassan Khomeini, who was the grandson of the founder of the Ayatollah Khomeini, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=797.2s)]
*  who was viewed as a reformist. He's much younger. He's 52. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=803.28s)]
*  Khomeini's son is 55. So they are a little bit younger, but a little bit more reformist [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=808.0s)]
*  from the Khomeini there. But of course he has the name and has that, the respect and everything that [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=814.0s)]
*  goes along with that. And all just so important though to consider that, you know, you never know [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=819.6800000000001s)]
*  what happens till it happens, but that is a continuation and just a sense of how deep these [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=826.5600000000001s)]
*  layers are. And General Votel, I am grateful for your time and thank you. As our breaking news [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=830.88s)]

*  What? By the way, no other outlet is talking about this. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=857.6s)]
*  I know it's very late there. The last time we spoke, you were saying it would be very difficult [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=861.5200000000001s)]
*  to get reaction from Iranian officials at this hour, but has anything new emerged when it comes [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=866.32s)]
*  to this announcement by Donald Trump that a ceasefire had been reached between Iran and Israel? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=872.0s)]
*  Yes. The new emerging development on the ground here in Tehran is more of sounds of explosion that [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=878.4s)]
*  we can hear related to the interception of air flying objects by the air defense system. Also, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=884.32s)]
*  we sensed a relatively massive explosion here at the Bureau before we start this [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=890.88s)]
*  live coverage. A few minutes ago, we just sensed the impact of explosion, but still speaking of [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=898.9599999999999s)]
*  your question, we haven't received any confirmation about any deal being reached between Iran and the [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=904.88s)]
*  United States about a possible ceasefire that we heard from the U.S. President Donald Trump. We have [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=914.0s)]
*  to keep waiting for confirmation of whether or not Iran is going to accept that, but still [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=920.24s)]
*  the reality on the ground, as I told you earlier, was that we've received this strong messages by [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=927.68s)]
*  the Iranian military officials saying that as long as Israeli strikes continue, and right now what we [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=933.8399999999999s)]
*  see is the continuation of these strikes, Iran is not going to stop there. Iran is going to strike [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=940.56s)]
*  back to respond to actually Israeli strikes, and now we see this continuation. So with that said, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=947.1999999999999s)]
*  we're not sure whether Iran is going to accept any deal for ceasefire regarding this latest [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=954.56s)]
*  developments that we can see. Also, I told you earlier we've got this statement from the [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=961.3599999999999s)]
*  Supreme Leader of the country, Abdullah Ali Khamenei, a couple of days ago, who came out [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=967.5999999999999s)]
*  in a video message saying that we're not going to accept any imposed peace. And the question here [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=972.4s)]
*  is that whether Iran is going to interpret this proposal. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=978.7199999999999s)]
*  Now we allocated nearly all the B2 bombers in existence and use more than half of our GBU [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=982.32s)]
*  57 to strike the sovereign country on behalf of the genocidal apartheid shows how far we've come [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=988.08s)]
*  in acting like their proxy. No, you don't understand. It was a big W because we don't even [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=994.1600000000001s)]
*  know if it actually successfully destroyed Fordow. Okay. We don't know. We don't, we don't even know [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=999.6s)]
*  if they actually successfully destroyed Fordow. And also on top of that, we know for a fact that [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1006.6400000000001s)]
*  we didn't get any of the fucking enriched uranium and you know, great stuff, great stuff overall. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1012.0s)]
*  It seems like crazy how much Hassan loves Iran. No man. This isn't about, first of all, of course, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1020.88s)]
*  I have no issue with Iran. What is your issue? What has Iran done to you? I don't want the [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1027.2s)]

*  I don't want anybody to die. Why are you seeing everything from this like incredibly narrow lens [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1038.88s)]
*  where you're like, nope, there's good and then there's bad. The Iranian government is evil. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1043.92s)]
*  Does that mean we should get nuked? We're far more evil than the Iranian government is. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1048.64s)]
*  What do you mean the Iranian government is evil? Why? Because they, they are a repressive regime, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1053.84s)]
*  right? They're repressive regime. They hurt their own population. Okay. So do we. And we heard a [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1059.44s)]
*  ton more people outside of our own population. Should we get nuked? I don't think so. I don't [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1064.88s)]
*  want to get nuked. Well, sometimes I do. Sometimes I'm like, God damn, what is this argument? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1068.88s)]
*  Does the U S hang gay people? Sometimes they have different methods of execution, not on the basis [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1074.4s)]
*  of being gay, but yeah, we've still killed people all the time. What are you talking about? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1080.0800000000002s)]
*  Oh, sorry. Those people deserve it, right? Even if they're found innocent after the fact, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1084.8000000000002s)]

*  civilians worse. Only a diplomatic and civil solution is viable. Iranian chatter and long time [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1112.1599999999999s)]

*  believed for no reason. That's the WMD lie. Just like Saddam had WMDs and he was willing to use it [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1335.6799999999998s)]
*  on America is the lie that the American government told to invade Iraq. That is also a lie. Okay. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1344.1599999999999s)]
*  It was not a strategical strike on nuclear facilities. First of all, that in and of itself [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1352.24s)]
*  is already a war crime. I like that we have decided that nuclear power plants and nuclear [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1358.56s)]
*  facilities are just now open targets. What do you think would have happened if the United States [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1363.44s)]
*  actually successfully blew up a nuclear facility? Do you think the civilians would be happy with the [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1368.4s)]
*  radiation poisoning and also more than 600 Iranians were killed in the process. So clearly it was the [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1373.92s)]
*  idea that there weren't targeting civilians is also bullshit. Do you remember when Zabar [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1381.68s)]
*  region nuclear patent was under bombardment in the Ukraine, Russian war and how the media was [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1385.6000000000001s)]
*  panicking rightfully all while blaming Russia for playing with fire. Exactly. I do remember. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1389.76s)]
*  So what was the point of the strike again? I'm confused. Okay, good. If you're asking this [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1394.72s)]
*  question was with sincerity, then that's good. This is the first step towards having a healthy [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1399.84s)]
*  dose of skepticism towards this current administration, which you should apply to [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1406.16s)]
*  every administration regardless. Okay. Great. Iran did not have nukes. Our own intelligence [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1409.84s)]
*  showed that Iran did not have nukes and did not have the capacity to develop nukes. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1416.32s)]
*  Okay. That's our own intelligence community's assessment. The only people that were saying [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1421.2s)]
*  Iran is about to get a nuke tomorrow, any day now was Israel. They've been saying that the same guy, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1424.3999999999999s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu has been saying that since 1992 for the record. And I think everyone knows [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1430.0s)]
*  at this point that when Israel is saying something, it's most likely a lie. Okay. So what was the point [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1436.08s)]
*  of the strike? The point of the strike was basically to entertain our most valuable ally, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1442.64s)]
*  Israel's genocidal ambitions. That was the only point. Israel wanted regime change in Iran. They [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1451.2800000000002s)]
*  started this amidst a denuclearization negotiation that Iran was conducting with the United States [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1458.72s)]
*  of America. They started this under the cover, the protective cover of said denuclearization [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1463.5200000000002s)]
*  agreement. Okay. Israel did this specifically for regime change. The nukes, the fake nukes lie was [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1469.2s)]
*  the cost is belly. It was bullshit. Nobody really believed it, but it didn't really matter. Ultimately, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1477.52s)]
*  the entire point of the strike was so that we were playing ball with Israel. We were playing ball with [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1482.16s)]
*  Israel and showing them that we are willing and able to also strike Iran and maybe even go to war [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1488.32s)]
*  with Iran at the behest of Israel. Okay. But the Iranian retaliation, the Iranian retaliation was [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1495.92s)]
*  also significantly limited against the American bases. And in the aftermath of the Iranian [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1504.0s)]
*  retaliation and its limitations, the American government came back and apparently put together [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1509.28s)]
*  this ceasefire, told Israel to stand down, which they will in a couple hours and told Iran to stand [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1515.92s)]
*  down, which I suspect they took gladly. So now that the ceasefire has been implemented, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1520.88s)]
*  there was no real goal here. It was just complete idiocy, complete madness and bloodshed for no [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1526.72s)]
*  reason. Welcome to the Trump administration. He does this all the time. I think we're far from [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1533.44s)]
*  done with Iran. I think the strike was testing the waters on a domestic acceptance. Israel will kill [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1539.3600000000001s)]
*  the ceasefire or something. It will trigger another start of the conflict. I agree. I don't think [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1542.88s)]
*  Israel is happy about this quote unquote ceasefire. Reuters, white house correspondent says [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1546.96s)]
*  Trump broker ceasefire and call when then Yahoo Monday afternoon while VP Marco Rubio Israel [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1554.8s)]
*  agreed. Wait, what Israel agreed to it. So long as Iran did not launch further attacks, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1558.64s)]
*  Iran signal to the U S that no more attacks would take place. The official said, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1564.64s)]
*  so Iran is eating it. Israel is going to continue bombing Iran and Iran is just going to eat it. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1568.24s)]
*  That is insane. If Iran, if the Iranian leadership actually said yes to this, [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1572.72s)]
*  they might as well have signed off on their own death warrant. Gotcha. Well, it's always good to [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1579.44s)]
*  hear two sides of the story. Understanding could believe your point of view. I mean, my point of [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1583.6000000000001s)]
*  view isn't just like my point of view is just describing the events that took place. Nothing I [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1588.16s)]
*  said is like even embellished a little bit. Yeah, we saw this. Witnesses claim that three projectiles [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1593.52s)]
*  struck a civilian building on Ferdowsi street. According to initial reports, the target was an [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1599.04s)]
*  Iranian nuclear scientist. Israel just carried out another assassination attempt and dead on. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1602.56s)]
*  I think, I think agreeing to this, agreeing to be bombed by Israel without any sort of retaliation [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1607.84s)]
*  in an effort to bring forward a ceasefire is the weakest moment of the Iranian regime. Israeli [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1615.92s)]
*  strikes continue after a three 30 Tel Aviv time. Iran will consider the ceasefire as voided source. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1622.56s)]
*  France 24. Okay. Don't forget about the CNN. I told a bunker story. I think if it's true, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1627.04s)]
*  it paints a picture of how such a deal could have been reached. It doesn't make sense because Trump's [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1632.0s)]
*  statement said when Israel and Iran have wound down and completed their in progress, final missions, [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1634.96s)]
*  this is again a pretty weak response anyway, from the Iranian side. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1639.84s)]
*  When it's three 30 Tel Aviv time, is it like half an hour from now? It's much later. No, let me see. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1646.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Half an hour from now, literally in the next 30 hour, 30 minutes. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1652.0s)]
*  30 AM in Tehran. I'm Mohammed Jamjoon with extended coverage of the latest escalation [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1658.56s)]
*  in the middle East. In the last two hours, president Donald Trump has announced what he says [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1663.44s)]
*  is a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran. He's congratulated both countries for agreeing to [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1667.8400000000001s)]
*  a complete and total end to hostilities. He says the ceasefire will take effect in stages over 24 [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1673.1200000000001s)]
*  hours. Neither Israel nor Iran have confirmed that they have agreed to this. Here's what president [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1678.8s)]
*  Trump wrote. Congratulations everyone. It has been fully agreed by and between Israel and bro. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1683.68s)]
*  The fact that Israel is not saying anything and has told Benjamin and I was told his cabinet to [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1689.6s)]
*  not reveal any information on this potential ceasefire. And the fact that Israel is, is bombing [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1695.04s)]
*  Tehran with great intensity at the moment. I I'm still confused as to whether or not this is like [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1702.56s)]
*  a real ceasefire or not. Regular flights from China have resumed Tehran. They're landing in 40 [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1708.64s)]
*  minutes. Who do you trust for your sources? Like people are saying random things. I'll know when [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1713.2800000000002s)]
*  I see it. I don't think it's fake, but we'll see what should be called the 12 day war. This is a [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1717.3600000000001s)]
*  war that could have gone on for years and destroyed the entire middle East, but it didn't. We'll be [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1722.16s)]
*  unpacking the latest development shortly with our correspondent, bro. This is there's something very [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1726.96s)]
*  strange happening. Do you, why do you want the war to go on? I don't. There's something very strange [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1731.5200000000002s)]
*  happening in Iran. I don't know. I don't know what's actually happening. They there's something [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1736.88s)]
*  very, very strange about this entire change might be possible in Iran in the past few hours. He has [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1743.44s)]
*  these posts on truth social saying, God bless Iran. What else have you been hearing? And if any other [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1749.7600000000002s)]
*  concrete details emerged? Well, Donald Trump just gave a phone interview the first time he's spoken [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1755.7600000000002s)]
*  publicly since announcing what he says is a ceasefire deal. He spoke with NBC news saying [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1760.48s)]
*  that it was a wonderful day for the world. And then when asked just how long he believes the [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1765.84s)]
*  ceasefire will be Trump answered that he thinks the ceasefire is unlimited, that it's going to go [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1770.9599999999998s)]
*  forever. Certainly a very jubilant tone to not only what he said in this interview, but also the [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1776.1599999999999s)]
*  post, which he just read that he announced on a on truth social about two hours ago. And we're also [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1783.12s)]
*  getting some more reporting from Reuters and from other sources that it wasn't just Trump who. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1789.12s)]
*  This is Osin defender. I mean, they're unreliable. I'm starting to think that how many is either [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1795.04s)]
*  dead or there has been some kind of coup with the Iranian armed forces, because that is the only way [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1799.6s)]
*  these statements are being made by Trump vans and other officials within the last hour make any sense. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1803.68s)]
*  Yeah, there's, there's something very, I think there's something very strange happening [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1810.0s)]
*  in Iran. And I don't know what it is because the ceasefire doesn't make any sense because [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1814.8s)]
*  Israel's aims have not been met here at all. So either Trump put the halt on Israel or something [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1819.92s)]
*  else is happening behind the scenes that we will quit. We will find out soon, but Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1827.28s)]
*  is a market silence on this, the continued heavy bombing campaign in Tehran. Israel's preparing for [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1834.96s)]
*  the possibility that Iran will fire heavy missile barrages before the ceasefire goes into effect [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1844.24s)]
*  per channel 12 Yaron Avraham. Israel prepares for the possibility of a relatively heavy barrages [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1848.4s)]
*  in the final hours before a ceasefire. I mean, that's, that's what I suspected as well, but it's [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1854.0s)]
*  weird that they're being like oddly quiet shock who no, no shot. Could you go over what's strange [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1859.6s)]
*  about this? I mean, everything is strange about this. Trump comes out and says there's a ceasefire. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1866.56s)]
*  Iranian officials first say there is no ceasefire. Then the ceasefires only confirmed through [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1872.48s)]
*  Qatar. They say this was a high level ceasefire that was conducted. The ceasefire also has like [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1878.8s)]
*  weird provisions in it. Like Israel can still undisturbed bomb Tehran over and over again [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1884.64s)]
*  with no retaliation from Iran whatsoever. Trump says the ceasefire will be permanent, [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1892.56s)]
*  which is also incredibly suspicious. No statements, what, no statements from any [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1899.76s)]
*  high ranking officials on the, no statements from any high ranking officials from like, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1904.72s)]
*  you know, the Ayatollah or, or any of the usual parties that would seemingly talk in this process. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1910.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1920.0s)]
*  Absolutely. It would have been prior to this ceasefire announcement, but I will tell you that [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1920.56s)]
*  across the board in those, these few hours since he made this announcement, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1925.92s)]
*  there has been a lot of praise for Trump. We heard from the U S house speaker [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1929.8400000000001s)]
*  American military base had an explosion on their radar site in Baghdad. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1933.8400000000001s)]
*  Deserves all the credit that this is what quote peace through strength looks like. And that it's [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1938.0s)]
*  really a big sigh of relief on Capitol Hill. We've seen Republicans who were all just about [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1944.0s)]
*  to submit a resolution that was in a sense, chastising Trump for going forward. Those [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1951.36s)]
*  military strikes on Iran without consulting Congress first. Now the sponsor of that saying [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1957.36s)]
*  that he was going to withdraw it. Now that if there is a ceasefire, that the point would be moot. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1962.6399999999999s)]
*  And we're seeing, you know, Trump's MAGA followers also praising this action. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1969.44s)]
*  Yeah. Trump's mega followers are stupid. Who cares? Baghdad operations commander, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1976.3999999999999s)]
*  Lieutenant general Wali Dal Tamimi has now confirmed that an unknown drone targeted [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1980.88s)]
*  air defense and radar site at Camp Taji to the north of the Capitol earlier, resulting [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1985.1200000000001s)]
*  in significant damage to the site, but no casualties among forces. That's weird too. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1989.0400000000002s)]
*  From the outset, Israel's aims were unmistakable. Torpedo. I don't think this, I think this was a [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=1997.44s)]
*  tremendous, tremendous defeat for Israel. Regardless of the fact that they were able to [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2004.24s)]
*  assassinate unconfirmed reports of the explosions at Camp Victory at Baghdad International Airport. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2010.08s)]
*  Hundreds of leaders. Yes. By Iranian estimations, you were saying an hour ago that this was a big [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2016.0s)]
*  L for Iran. It is, it is still a ginormous L for Iran. It is just simply also a ginormous L for [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2023.28s)]
*  Israel. Iran did not achieve a significant victory here because it did not actually [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2030.88s)]
*  establish deterrence. It was not able to defend its military commanders. It was not able to defend [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2038.8000000000002s)]
*  its boundaries, its borders. Iran got attacked by the United States of America and Israel. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2047.0400000000002s)]
*  I think anyone that says this was a giant victory for Iran is coping because they don't realize that [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2053.92s)]
*  Israel was able to maintain air superiority over Iranian airspace for extended periods of time. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2059.9199999999996s)]
*  If you think that they're not going to do this one more time, once they re-up and re-arm on their [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2067.2799999999997s)]
*  anti-air defenses, you're silly. The only major setback for Israel here is that they weren't able [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2071.68s)]
*  to get it done this time. What if Iran's lying crazy mode and at 331, they just randomly launch [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2077.8399999999997s)]
*  a nuclear weapon that's not going to happen. If I were to measure the successes of Iran, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2083.92s)]
*  I would say this much. Restrained or not, it doesn't matter. They were able to successfully [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2089.6800000000003s)]
*  continue a war of attrition with ballistic missiles alone and were able to wither away [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2097.6800000000003s)]
*  and deplete and exhaust the limited resources of Israel's air defenses. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2104.64s)]
*  Tel Aviv and the rest of Israel proper is no longer seen as this island that is an impenetrable [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2112.7999999999997s)]
*  fortress. Israel's public will always now potential repercussions. They will know [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2119.7599999999998s)]
*  that if Israel decides to behave in the ways that it has, at least against Iran, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2128.48s)]
*  that there are still severe penalties. Israel only gets to behave in the violent ways that it does [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2133.76s)]
*  because it has created this assurance for its population that we do as much violence as [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2140.96s)]
*  possible, but you don't experience it. You can do like, you know, gay liberal laptop work or whatever [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2150.48s)]
*  and drink kombucha and matcha in the morning. While there is a unlimited genocide happening [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2158.4799999999996s)]
*  like 50 miles away, you get to do that. You know, you get to live like a Western style life [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2165.6s)]
*  in the middle of this region because you're defended by unlimited amounts of air defense [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2173.68s)]
*  support from the United States of America. Yes, exactly like America, exactly like America. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2179.68s)]
*  The only difference is America is all the way over here and Israel is in the ass cheeks of a [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2185.04s)]
*  bunch of countries that have long range ballistic missiles that can clearly penetrate the Iron Dome [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2192.88s)]
*  and the Arrow Defense System and the David Sling and the THAAD and the cruisers that are like [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2198.96s)]
*  literally planted next door to Israel so that they can constantly try to intercept these [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2205.2s)]
*  missiles that are coming in Israel's direction. You can't be doing, you know, gay laptop work [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2212.72s)]
*  while you're doing a genocide. It just can't happen. Seemingly it can't happen in perpetuity. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2220.3999999999996s)]
*  I do think this. Yes, I agree with this. Very possible that Israel wants to cease fire because [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2225.2799999999997s)]
*  it's running low on interceptors. Reports days ago suggested they were running low and that system [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2229.8399999999997s)]
*  is already overwhelmed. Strikes have clearly been getting through. It might be a temporary ploy to [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2233.9199999999996s)]
*  restock and resume the war. That's what I think as well. The internet says otherwise, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2237.52s)]
*  what do you mean? What is the internet saying? There are 14 minutes remaining, 14 minutes [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2242.32s)]
*  remaining until the ceasefire deadline is passed. Iran has already stated that they are going to [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2248.32s)]
*  strike or the ceasefire is void if they go beyond the point and Israel hasn't stopped striking. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2257.28s)]
*  Apparently heavy airstrikes are continuing against Western Tehran still. Now the other side of this, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2264.0s)]
*  of course, is that Iran has no launches that have taken place so far. Iran has not launched any [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2269.28s)]
*  counter strikes and retaliation, even though they signaled that they would. That's also interesting. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2276.4s)]
*  I don't know what they're planning. I also don't know what's going on in Iraq. Apparently there's [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2281.2000000000003s)]
*  explosions happening in Iraq. There are initial reports of casualties at Baghdad International [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2284.96s)]
*  Airport that were struck. Explosions reported near Baghdad International Airport and the Balad [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2288.8s)]
*  Air Base. Initial reports of casualties at Baghdad International. The source of the fire is currently [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2293.6800000000003s)]
*  unknown. The idea of a buzzer beater ceasefire missiles is crazy. It's not unique. Israel always [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2298.4s)]
*  does that. What's unique is Israel is doing this to a country that has the capability of striking [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2304.64s)]
*  back for once. When Israel did this to Lebanon, Lebanon had no capacity to penetrate the Iron Dome [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2310.4s)]
*  as successfully as Iran had. Trump announced it too early. One, there is a ceasefire. Two, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2316.32s)]
*  Trump was supposed to announce it later and surprised with an early announcement. Three, [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2325.84s)]
*  Israel received guarantees that Iran would not return to developing nuclear weapons. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2328.8s)]
*  Here's the thing. Israel has a million different things that they can claim to restart this [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2332.96s)]
*  bombing campaign. Okay. There's a million different things that they can do. They can say, [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2341.76s)]
*  we have, we found, we have good authority. We figured out where the enriched uranium is hiding [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2346.4s)]
*  or they can still say we have to take out their ballistic missile launchers [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2352.4s)]
*  or they could just go for the big prize and claim that, you know, we got to take out the Ayatollah. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2357.44s)]
*  So the only reason why this is currently happening is because Israel, I think, doesn't have the [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2362.88s)]
*  capability of withstanding further missiles being lobbed in its direction from Iran. So now you're [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2369.36s)]
*  pissed. We have peas. No, I'm pissed because I foresee this piece not being real peas. Is that [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2377.04s)]
*  really hard to comprehend? I want it to be real peas. Hold on. I mean, practically pieces. Great. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2382.8s)]
*  Yeah. I agree. Open flight radar to open flight radar. Two planes are landing in Iran from China. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2389.76s)]
*  Yeah. I don't know what the F that means. What brother, what are the chances Iran will [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2396.8s)]
*  attack American bases in Germany? I live here. So I'm asking, I'm really scared. What do you think [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2400.48s)]
*  brother? There was a rumor based on a number of large military cargo planes that Iran [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2404.56s)]
*  on. We buckled up. It is gechar. Kadeesh. Bebeck gibison. Or the sand. I want you to watch where [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2418.72s)]
*  Cocker Carlson says, thank God. Wuhan judicial coup swan. Thank God. It was Ron fixed it. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2424.8799999999997s)]
*  Thank Trump. You mean can't wait to see the podcast of you apologizing. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2432.72s)]
*  Can Tucker and Trump be friends again? Whoever said about the planes flying into Iran, those [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2437.8399999999997s)]
*  are running passenger planes returning home. I don't know anything about the planes. I'm not, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2442.3999999999996s)]
*  I don't, I don't look at flight radar. What probability of Russia and China to give Iran [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2448.4s)]
*  a new to establish true deterrence. Very, very low. Following Iran's retaliatory strikes on the [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2453.1200000000003s)]

*  The prime minister of Qatar, shake Muhammad bin Abdul Rahman Al Thani, then coordinated with [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2465.52s)]

*  that Iran stopped attacking their country. A senior white house official told CNN Iran agreed [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2481.76s)]
*  to those terms. The source said during the negotiations, Trump directly communicated with [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2485.28s)]

*  going on. I'm going to be real with you all. I am also here now. Yeah. This is before we even factor [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2497.6800000000003s)]

*  I think Iran is currently under heavy bombardment. So it's making it probably very difficult to, [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2540.3199999999997s)]

*  the talks and was like, I am Persian. Mr. President Trump, president Trump, I want a ceasefire. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2765.28s)]

*  bikini. Mr. President. Like what happened? I am Ayatollah Haman. A Mr. President Israel agreed to [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2789.92s)]
*  ceasefire on the condition that Iran's office strikes. White house official says less than one [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2799.2000000000003s)]
*  minute ago, Israel agreed to the ceasefire deal while they're still bombing past the point of the [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2802.4s)]
*  ceasefire. This edging is making me feel a certain way. Like was there a coup or something? Like [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2807.04s)]
*  what's happening during the negotiations? US president Donald Trump communicated directly, [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2812.7200000000003s)]
*  blah, blah, blah. We already covered this. There's nothing new. The outlets like Al Jazeera that are [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2816.4s)]

*  been saying, we don't know if there's a real ceasefire or not. And now the most reliable news [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2828.32s)]
*  so far coming from Fars, the, the ceasefire proposal put forward by US president Donald Trump [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2833.2000000000003s)]
*  is completely false. No official or unofficial ceasefire proposal has been received from Iran. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2838.56s)]
*  I don't get it. I wonder if there is like a power struggle between the IRGC and the Ayatollah. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2842.32s)]
*  I don't know. I have no idea. And, and the, the military is still saying like no ceasefire is [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2847.2000000000003s)]
*  taking place. Israel says yes. Now Israel's giving confirmation to CNN that they have agreed to the [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2853.1200000000003s)]
*  ceasefire while they're still bombing home front command stays that defense policies remain [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2860.6400000000003s)]
*  unchanged. No educational activities, no gatherings, only essential businesses may operate. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2865.6800000000003s)]
*  The public is urged to continue following official instructions. Okay. So Israel itself is not [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2869.12s)]
*  Israel itself doesn't think that there is a ceasefire happening either [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2876.0s)]
*  Israeli army radio, sarsing, citing sources. There's a possibility of rocket barrages being [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2881.7599999999998s)]
*  launched towards Israel. Iran just struck Iraq. What? No, you don't know if this is Iran that did [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2885.3599999999997s)]
*  this. What are you talking about? I thought there was like time to test, test your theory. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2893.92s)]
*  I know shit's happening in Iraq as well. We don't know why it's happening. I feel like they just [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2899.92s)]
*  did this bullshit to be like, see Iran is not to be trusted. They said that they wanted to implement [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2905.76s)]
*  a ceasefire, but they're not abiding by the ceasefire. We just got to pack it up in response [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2911.52s)]
*  to this media fabrication. The Islamic Republic of Iran will soon demonstrate on the ground and in [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2917.76s)]
*  the field, the falsehoods of this claim to the Zionist regime. Yeah. I think they maybe they're [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2922.32s)]
*  just like, they're going to claim that Iran is actually not abiding by the ceasefire that they [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2927.28s)]
*  never saw, but it happened so fast. I don't think people are going to fucking think that this was [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2932.2400000000002s)]
*  like, I don't think people are going to believe that Iran actually violated Trump's big, beautiful [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2936.56s)]
*  ceasefire. Like, you know what I mean? I mean the cult will, but they're fucking stupid. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2941.6800000000003s)]
*  And that's not enough, especially because there's no appetite. There is no appetite for fucking [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2948.16s)]
*  going to war with Iran. The Iranian who negotiated a ceasefire, Mr. President. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2955.36s)]
*  Who the fuck did they talk to? No, what makes this weirder is cutter. Okay. Like that is, that gives [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2963.84s)]
*  it a point of legitimacy, a point of authority when the emir is saying that they facilitated a [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2972.32s)]
*  ceasefire with Iran. That gives it a point of fucking legitimacy. Cause like, yeah, I can, [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2980.4s)]
*  I can see the Americans lying, but I'd be shocked if the fucking, the, the emir of cutter is lying [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2986.88s)]
*  at the behest of America. Sure. They are still obviously a pro America. They have a massive [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=2994.56s)]
*  American military base. U S central command is there. But even then it's just like, [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=3000.16s)]
*  that makes no sense. That also violates the sole purpose of, of cutter being a mediator in these [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=3006.96s)]
*  negotiations. They wouldn't just like do some fuck shit here so that America could go and, [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=3012.64s)]
*  and do a Psyop like this. No, it's not Muslim on Muslim betrayal. There are two places where these [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=3019.2s)]
*  actual negotiations take place. Cutter and Oman. Okay. Neither of these, neither of these countries [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=3024.8s)]
*  would, would place, would place themselves in the crosshairs like this partially because they also [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=3035.6000000000004s)]
*  have a financial investment in the stability of, of the region and, and have proximity to Iran [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=3042.2400000000002s)]
*  that are in the crosshairs, but also cutter is supposed to be like the, the middleman for these [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=3052.48s)]
*  kinds of negotiations to take place. Under Zufferero, who is a CIA agent, they took the engineers and [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=3059.68s)]
*  scientists. It's literally, if not by, by [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTCe3QrWUeQ&t=3068.0s)]
