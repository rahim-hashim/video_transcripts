# What's Wrong With These Guys? | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [November 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84)
*  Okay. So it didn't have about two weeks. And I think that was when Kamala Harris came out [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=0.0s)]
*  and said, okay, you've got 30 days to fix this. Otherwise we're going to reconsider [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=3.24s)]
*  selling arms. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Okay. First of all, that wasn't Kamala Harris. That was Joe Biden. And secondly, Benjamin [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  and Yahoo didn't do that. And there wasn't a single human rights group on the ground [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=13.88s)]
*  that actually claimed that Israel successfully had followed through on Biden's, well, you [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=18.96s)]
*  got British backup against your naysayers. Oh yeah. I didn't even watch the whole video, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=28.86s)]
*  but I liked it and reposted it, but I didn't even watch this video. Here, let's see what [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=32.86s)]
*  he had to say. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=38.019999999999996s)]
*  He is consistently smeared as a radical anti-Semitic extremist because he dares to humanize the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=39.019999999999996s)]
*  Palestinian people and their politics. And also because he criticizes Israel in a way [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=45.019999999999996s)]
*  that is consistent with the ICC. I see. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=51.54s)]
*  You're a deeply unserious person. Yeah, I am. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=54.86s)]
*  The Pope, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty and so many other internationally respected human [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=57.86s)]
*  rights organizations. But the streamers, Lonerbox and Destiny are consistently held up as more [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=64.53999999999999s)]
*  reasonable people who deal with Palestine and Israel in a much more balanced way. But [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=70.86s)]
*  here they are with a literal Israeli government propagandist, Elon Levy, a man who was paid [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=76.22s)]
*  by the Israeli government and Benjamin Netanyahu's office to go on British and Western media [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=83.26s)]
*  so as to lie for the Israeli government and to justify the continual s*** of Palestinian [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=89.5s)]
*  people. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=95.98s)]
*  And then of course, I'm sure as many of you will know, one of the key figures crusading [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=97.14s)]
*  against Hassan has been his former co-host, Ethan Klein. And just watch Lonerbox yesterday, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=101.44s)]
*  the man who was brought on by Ethan to give reasonable opinions about Palestine. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=108.16s)]
*  You can get in. I think the American government, I don't know if you know recently there was [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=113.28s)]
*  like a measure that was taken in October for two weeks where Israel basically, I think [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=116.28s)]
*  without actually without getting approval from Central Command, basically decided that [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=120.0s)]
*  they were going to surround the north of Gaza and to do that operation they weren't going [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  to let anything in. Okay, so they did that for about two weeks and I think that was when [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=124.6s)]
*  Kamala Harris came out and said, okay, damn bro, he f***ing speed fried this. I can't [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  even understand what he's trying to say. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=131.16s)]
*  You've got 30 days to fix this. Otherwise we're going to reconsider selling our own [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=133.0s)]
*  And that's a pretty interesting thing for America to do. I can talk about that reconsidering [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=135.6s)]
*  our state very often. And then basically post a bunch of videos saying look, there's a bunch [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=138.88s)]
*  of trucks swinging in Gaza. So I think getting government. Damn, I don't know what do you, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=141.64s)]
*  can you slow down the Tik Tok? I don't think I can. I just genuinely can't even hear what [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=145.6s)]
*  he's saying. Clip in the description where it's not. He's saying the idea of doing the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=150.64s)]
*  generals plan in northern Gaza was a goof done by one IDF brigade and that Kamala was [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=155.26s)]
*  the one that put a stop to it. Oh, oh, you can slow it down. Hold on. Let's do it. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=159.4s)]
*  I think cohost Ethan Clyde brought the American government. I don't know. Recently there was [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=165.72s)]
*  like a measure that was taken in October for two weeks where Israel basically, I think [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=171.2s)]
*  without actually without getting approval from central command basically decided that [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=176.44s)]
*  they were going to surround the north of Gaza and to do that operation. They weren't going [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=179.6s)]
*  to let anything in. Okay. So it didn't have about two weeks. And I think that was when [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=182.56s)]
*  Kamala Harris came out and said, okay, you've got 30 days to fix this. Otherwise we're going [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=185.84s)]
*  to reconsider selling arms. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=189.64s)]
*  Okay. First of all, that wasn't Kamala Harris. That was Joe Biden. And secondly, Benjamin [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=190.64s)]
*  and Yahoo didn't do that. And there wasn't a single human rights group on the ground [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=197.27999999999997s)]
*  that actually claimed that Israel successfully had followed through on Biden's Biden's red [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=202.35999999999999s)]
*  line, his second red line. And not only that, but the leaked state department memo showed [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=208.23999999999998s)]
*  that they wanted 350 trucks to go in daily. And not only did Israel cut the aid in the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=214.28s)]
*  trucks in half, but also was, I think at its peak allowing only 30 trucks. This was all, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=221.6s)]
*  this was quite literally answered by the state department where a bunch of the state department [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=230.51999999999998s)]
*  journalists at a press briefing asked why Biden had not followed through on Biden's [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=236.39999999999998s)]
*  the red line that they said, why Biden was not enforcing the red line that he said he [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=244.51999999999998s)]
*  wanted to do. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=250.23999999999998s)]
*  50 is the most that they let Israel. It's 58 trucks in the Northern Gaza, but this is [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=251.95999999999998s)]
*  like, once again, they have the aid on the trucks and they only let 50 trucks in the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=256.84s)]
*  line that Biden wanted them to enforce was 350 trucks, according to a leaked state department [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=263.36s)]
*  memo. And yes, see Israel 30 trucks of aid to reach Northern Gaza on Monday after nearly [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=270.36s)]
*  two weeks. And as far as I understand, like the aid that they had was also halved as well. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=276.0s)]
*  If you go to Kojad and do the math, the month of November, they're only allowing 80 trucks [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=289.6s)]
*  a day average. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=293.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, government pressure goes a long way is ridiculous. I mean, look, I'm not, I'm [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=301.36s)]
*  not going to immediately rush to conclusions and say like, he's behaving like a propagandist [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=311.44s)]
*  for the state of Israel by trying to make himself come out like a person who is critical [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=315.84000000000003s)]
*  of Israel, but also simultaneously. And also, simultaneously, like saying that Israel is [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=322.36s)]
*  a separate actor that is operating outside of the scope of America and that, you know, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=329.44s)]
*  America has like limitations in, in terms of what it can and can't say to Israel, but [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=334.6s)]
*  it sure does feel like it, especially when, you know, paired up with the reality that [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=339.96000000000004s)]
*  he has, you know, hung out with Elan Levy in Israel alongside destiny. But on like what [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=343.84000000000003s)]
*  he said here, I'm just going to address just what he said here. Okay. It's wrong. Not only [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=351.76s)]
*  that America, not only did America make serious demands and even said that they would actually [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=358.76s)]
*  deny weapons transfers if Israel didn't follow through on it, because Israel decided they're [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=364.12s)]
*  going to do the final solution in Northern Gaza, as you guys know, and Biden leading [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=369.52s)]
*  up to the election, like so close 30 days out from the election basically said, or 20 [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=375.24s)]
*  days out from the election basically said, Oh, I'm enforcing a 30 day line, a red line [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=379.8s)]
*  where you can't deny aid going into Northern Gaza. And Israel did not follow that enforcement [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=386.8s)]
*  at all. And also the very fact that Biden knows that he could apply this kind of pressure [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=395.56s)]
*  by saying we're going to refuse weapons transfers that in and of itself is already, you know, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=400.52000000000004s)]
*  that that means that they know they know the kind of they know the mechanisms of enforcement. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=406.16s)]
*  They know the kind of influence that they hold over Israel. It's ridiculous. It's all [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=410.76s)]
*  just aesthetic posturing from the Biden campaign or in the Biden administration. Sorry to make [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=415.48s)]
*  it seem like they're trying to do something is no different than the Gaza pier. They built [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=421.52000000000004s)]
*  that so that they could claim that like they were doing their very best to render aid, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=426.16s)]
*  to render aid to the Palestinian population, because everybody understands that it is a [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=433.16s)]
*  clear-cut direct version of human rights law to refuse to render aid and allow humanitarian [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=438.32s)]
*  aid to go to a civilian area. Okay. It's just, that is like the definitional number one, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=445.32s)]
*  no, no, it's so glaringly obvious that the person, the founder of human rights watch, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=452.8s)]
*  who originally is not exactly critical of Israel and, and was actually on board with [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=459.24s)]
*  Israel's military actions in the immediate aftermath of October 7 changed his perspective [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=465.24s)]
*  publicly and said Israel is doing a specifically because of the reality that they are refusing [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=471.59999999999997s)]
*  to allow humanitarian aid to go in to parts of Gaza, specifically safe zones. Okay. That's [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=479.8s)]
*  it. It is such an obvious violation of human rights that it is one of the factors that [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=486.8s)]
*  the American state department is supposed to consider when invoking the Leahy law. Yeah, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=494.36s)]
*  here it is. Human rights watch founder changes mind on Israel's side charge. The co-founder [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=500.56s)]
*  of human rights watch whose German Jewish parents had to flee Nazi German Tulsi. And [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=504.76s)]
*  he now believes Israel's committing a genocide in Gaza. Arieh Nair, who was also the head [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=507.68s)]
*  of the American civil liberties union, previously didn't believe Israel's military actions on [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=512.04s)]
*  Gaza could be considered a genocide, but he changed his mind after. So it's, you know, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=515.24s)]
*  it's not something that you can, not exactly something you can argue against. At best you [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=520.48s)]
*  can be like, oh, America's trying their best, but they're just failing to do so. But I think [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=524.72s)]
*  adults understand, like if you're, if you're even remotely reasonable, you understand that [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=529.4s)]
*  America wants Israel to do these things, even if they are, even if they're incurring severe [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=533.9s)]
*  penalties for it in the form of losing social capital. People like this are willing to say [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=541.28s)]
*  and do absolutely anything to justify. He tries to claim, oh, it wasn't actually the [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=548.76s)]
*  Israeli government who decided to siege and starve northern Gaza as if Netanyahu and the [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=554.52s)]
*  other. How are they losing social capital? How is America losing social capital on the [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=560.52s)]
*  global stage by aiding and abetting Israel's genocide? What do you mean? You have tens [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=564.76s)]
*  of thousands of people fucking protesting in the streets in the Western world that is [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=570.76s)]
*  like unheard of against, against Israel. That's, you know, that kind of pressure inevitably [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=574.7s)]
*  creates that kind of pressure inevitably creates a fraction in Western governance between what [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=581.9s)]
*  their politicians are saying and doing and what the public wants and demands. Okay. When [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=590.58s)]
*  you sit there and you undermine the UN and you undermine ICC and you undermine the ICJ, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=596.7s)]
*  you are withering away at your soft power capabilities. You're withering away, you're [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=602.42s)]
*  withering away your diplomatic capabilities. Ironically enough, this is something that [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=607.0799999999999s)]

*  opposite. He was saying that America was headed down a dangerous path with Donald Trump, which [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=617.38s)]
*  I did agree with to a certain degree. Wait, are you saying that the US wants the genocide? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=623.14s)]
*  I've been operating on the assumption that they don't want the genocide, but also don't [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=626.9399999999999s)]
*  care if it happens. No, I'm saying that no, there is, there are things that Israel gets [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=629.78s)]
*  to do that America doesn't like. Okay. Like spying on American state assets, right? Like [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=635.9s)]
*  America doesn't like that. Okay. Stealing sensitive information from the CIA, for example, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=641.26s)]
*  America's not fond of that sort of thing. Or even creating surveillance technology such [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=647.78s)]
*  as Pegasus that they give to everyone and anyone. Sometimes people that America doesn't [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=652.2s)]
*  want to have that kind of surveillance technology. Now, having said that, why is Israel allowed [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=658.62s)]
*  to do this? Is it because Jewish people have magical mind control powers? No, of course [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=665.3s)]
*  not. Okay. It's because Israel is given that bandwidth to do those things because Israel [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=669.22s)]
*  is a very important asset for American imperialism in the region. Okay. America, just like the [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=676.58s)]
*  western world, historically have had designs for this region. All of the nation states [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=683.66s)]
*  that you see in the region were directly drawn by western imperialist forces. Okay, they [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=690.7s)]
*  were and they were designed in a way where there was always supposed to be sectarian [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=697.98s)]
*  in fighting. Okay. Whether it be Lebanon, whether it be Syria, whether it be Jordan. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=703.1s)]
*  These states were designed specifically so there was always ethnic strife, always ethnic [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=711.06s)]
*  tension, always religious sectarian differences that would cause destabilization because [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=718.42s)]
*  destabilization ultimately is very beneficial for western states in this resource rich region. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=724.8199999999999s)]
*  Western states that want to control this resource rich region. Okay. Imagine being a ban [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=734.14s)]

*  read the most unhinged chatters? Um, because I like it. Anyway, he's saying I'm loco. Anyway, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=751.38s)]
*  where was I? What was I talking about? I'm forgetting others at the top don't know what's [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=758.22s)]
*  going on. And it's just being carried out by a few road commanders. And when you listen [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=763.46s)]
*  to what he's saying about how Israel approved aid, that US government pressure works. No, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=768.7s)]
*  it didn't. Israel did not meet the deadlines that the US government set. And what you should [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=774.1400000000001s)]
*  be focusing on in this conversation are the actual [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=779.5s)]
*  Oh, Israel's bandwidth to do what it wants. Yes. Israel is more valuable of an asset as [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=782.98s)]
*  it is a settler colonial project. In its inception. Israel is a more significant asset in the [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=788.86s)]
*  region than any number of these different countries that could actually succumb to the [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=797.26s)]
*  whims of sectarian violence, and maybe even a revolution. Historically speaking, some of [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=801.5s)]
*  these Arab countries have even tried to align with the USSR, for example, big no no. Okay, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=808.02s)]
*  Israel, on the other hand, has always been loyal to Western interests. And Israel, especially in [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=816.9s)]
*  the aftermath of the dissolution of the apartheid state of South Africa, has learned very important [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=823.9s)]
*  lessons, such as making themselves so entangled with Western enterprise that it is impossible to [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=829.06s)]
*  divest. Israel has also spent a whole a good deal of money in that timeframe, to do a shit ton of [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=837.9399999999999s)]
*  positive PR. So it is an invaluable ally in the eyes of the United States's State Department. Okay, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=848.06s)]
*  now that doesn't change the reality that sometimes because it goes so far in its endless bloodshed, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=857.14s)]
*  and its endless destabilization, that there are people within the State Department that want to [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=865.4599999999999s)]
*  continue American dominance in the region that are directly at odds with how hard they want to [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=871.8599999999999s)]
*  let Israel go. Okay, that's why you see all the people who resigned, for example, from the State [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=877.9s)]
*  Department and have continued to resign since October 7. Israel also is a testing ground for [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=884.22s)]
*  all of the most nefarious and insidious forms of dominance against a civilian public. Israel gets [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=892.42s)]
*  to be our war factory, Gaza specifically gets to be our war factory, a weapons lab, Israel gets to [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=901.66s)]
*  be a laboratory for unique different methods of dominating a population. It serves many different [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=907.78s)]
*  interests that America has. Just like Turkey, by way of NATO serves America's purpose in the region [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=919.3s)]
*  in a very similar capacity, right? Because people always ask us on like, well, people always claim [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=927.1s)]
*  I'm not critical of the Turkish involvement in Syria, and I am, which is ironic, because all those [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=933.0999999999999s)]
*  people then turn around and say I'm a fucking Assadist, ironically enough, but Turkey gets to, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=938.5s)]
*  for example, bomb the northern Syrian corridor into oblivion and completely enforce control over [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=944.7399999999999s)]
*  it. Because, and even in certain instances, accidentally blow up American positions, for [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=949.78s)]
*  example. And why does it get to do that? Well, sometimes deconfliction doesn't work in the ways [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=956.6199999999999s)]
*  that it's supposed to, but why does it get to do that? Because it's America's weapon in the region. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=963.02s)]
*  Same with Israel, Israel can blow up a fucking USS carrier, and America will be like, yo, my bad. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=967.26s)]
*  Why? Because America doesn't give a fuck about its own troops or its own citizens like duh, no shit. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=972.6999999999999s)]
*  America gives a fuck about American foreign interests. America gives a fuck about how much [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=980.34s)]
*  money our corporations and the military industrial complex can make. America gives a fuck about how [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=985.9s)]
*  much our oil producers, our fossil fuel industry, how much money they could make in the region. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=990.38s)]
*  There's always a bigger picture out there. And Israel plays a very important role in this bigger [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=996.86s)]
*  picture. So make no mistake. That's a bold statement. Yeah, dude, America cared so much about [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=1001.78s)]
*  our fucking brave and bold military. Our soldiers are wonderful soldiers that 22 veterans kill [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=1007.18s)]
*  themselves every fucking day when they come back from these, these parts of the world where they just [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=1014.66s)]
*  like engaged in unlimited murder and destruction at the behest of the same interest that I just [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=1021.58s)]
*  mentioned, the military industrial complex and the fossil fuel industry. Yeah, they care so much [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=1028.94s)]
*  about these soldiers. You simply just say false shit confidently. Sorry. It's the it's no longer [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=1036.62s)]
*  22. You're right. I think it's 14 now. My bad. My bad. Yeah, I know. I read that article to erm, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=1042.86s)]
*  fact check, please. Fact check, please. It's no longer 22. The numbers have been reduced. Erm, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=1050.98s)]
*  yeah, a song How good does Dan Clancy's dick taste? Wow, real cool, man. What happened? I [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=1056.98s)]
*  thought he I thought he was in love with me. Now you're saying I'm in love with him. Is that what [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=1063.26s)]
*  happened? Oh, sorry, it's not 14. It's 17. Erm, it's not 22. It's 17. Anyway, so my point is, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=1066.86s)]
*  America obviously doesn't give a shit about its own citizens either. They care about they care about [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=1074.62s)]
*  enforcing their they care about engaging in their imperialist desires and in areas where there are [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=1079.24s)]
*  resources that must be controlled, that must be extracted. They care about capital. That is the [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=1086.58s)]
*  master. So yeah, that's why America lets Israel do whatever the fuck it wants in the area. And, and [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=1093.98s)]
*  I think that a big part of the reason is because we have more important targets in mind. Okay, that [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=1101.6200000000001s)]
*  more important target that we have in mind is China. And you can't have instability in the region. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=1108.6200000000001s)]
*  If you have any sort of interest in dealing with China, you can't have instability in the Middle [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=1115.9s)]
*  East, you have to by force dominate your your most important allies, thorn on its side. 5 million [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=1119.74s)]
*  people that demand sovereignty, understandably. You can't do that you have to, you know, destroy [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=1129.34s)]
*  them first, you have to engage in maybe population transfer, mass ethnic cleansing. Okay, that's I [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=1136.02s)]
*  think America's ultimate goal is to sick Israel on Israel's enemies. And then inevitably, once the [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=1142.78s)]
*  region is somewhat stabilized, continue along with the Abraham Accords, you know, normalize relations [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=1150.66s)]
*  with all the other client states that already had informal normalized relations, but formalize those [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=1156.5s)]
*  normal relations and move on to, you know, Taiwan. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=1161.48s)]
*  There are a lot of aid organizations who are saying that almost no aid is reaching northern Gaza, and that last week Israel denied 82 out of 91 attempts to bring aid to that area. But of course, for Lonebox, he needs to tell you the Israeli government narrative, because he's balanced and two sided. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=1167.06s)]
*  And if you ever wonder why I'm so dismissive of liberal Zionists and people who say, Oh, why can't you give the Israeli side? This is the Israeli side. It's just lies to justify the extermination of Palestinian people, or in times where they're not waging a brutal assault on Gaza, it is done to justify keeping Palestinians under an apartheid regime and taking their land constantly. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=1188.34s)]
*  Yep. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=1213.6999999999998s)]
*  I, on the other hand, believe that Palestinians deserve dignity and the right to live in the land that they have continually been marginalized in and ethnically cleansed from by the Zionist project. And of course, that means that people like me and her son are radical extremists. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=1214.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=1231.38s)]
*  Anyway, good stuff all around. We'll do a little, we'll do a little basketball break. God is so foreign policy dense today. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Ji8A5XM84&t=1239.8600000000001s)]
