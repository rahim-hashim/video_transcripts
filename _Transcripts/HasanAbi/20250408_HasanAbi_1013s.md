**HasanAbi:** [April 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY)
*  There's also some good news coming out of Louisiana of all places [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=0.0s)]
*  but the Department of Homeland Security that thought that the Louisiana judge that would rubber stamp the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=4.48s)]
*  deportation of Mahmoud Khalil and [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=11.76s)]
*  and anyone really for that matter has said [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=14.52s)]
*  stated today and this is from Delaney Nolan at the Guardian [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=19.84s)]
*  up [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=24.8s)]
*  Our deficit with these Trump speaks of the National Republican Congressional Committee dinner put a tariff on them. They sell it like with steel [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=29.6s)]
*  They were dumping tremendous amounts of steel into our country during my term [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=37.96s)]
*  I saved every steel mill every we only have steel mills because of what I did. I put a high tariff on them [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=41.92s)]
*  That and it stopped it stopped. They were dumping so much steel [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=48.84s)]
*  We would have lost every single steel mill the people that like me best are the people in the steel business [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=54.6s)]
*  But I think the auto business is going to be right there. I think chips are going to be there [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=59.92s)]
*  I think pharmaceuticals are going to be there because you know [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=63.56s)]
*  We don't make our own [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  Pharmaceuticals drugs and other things to get better [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=70.52s)]
*  They're made in other countries and you pay a number. I mean the same package in [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  our country compared to like London [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=81.08s)]
*  and other places [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=83.58000000000001s)]
*  Is sometimes ten times more? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=85.98s)]
*  ten times more something that sells for eighty eight dollars in London sells for [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=89.78s)]
*  $1,300 here made in the same factory by the same company and [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=96.10000000000001s)]
*  That's over. I told them all that's over [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=100.94000000000001s)]
*  So they put all of their research and develop money they put everything [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=104.30000000000001s)]
*  But what they don't tell you is that these other countries are smart they say you can't charge more than eighty eight dollars [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=108.38s)]
*  otherwise, you can't sell your product and [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=113.7s)]
*  The drug companies listen to them, but we're going to do something that we have to do [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=117.42s)]
*  We're going to put we're going to tariff our pharmaceuticals and once we do that [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=123.3s)]
*  They're going to come rushing back into our country because we're the big market the advantage [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=126.94s)]
*  We have over everybody is that we're the big market [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=131.38s)]
*  So we're gonna be announcing that he got that shit on he made your tariff on pharmaceuticals looking good [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=134.44s)]
*  And when you and I'm not afraid to admit that here that hot they will leave China [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=139.6s)]
*  they will leave other places because they have to sell most of their product is sold here and [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=144.96s)]
*  They're gonna be opening up their plants all over the place in our country. We're gonna be announcing that so that's breaking news [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=149.92s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, we have breaking news [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=155.72s)]
*  That's what's gonna happen [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=158.0s)]
*  What other presidents allow [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=159.76s)]
*  China to get away with is absolutely criminal [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=161.76s)]
*  But I'm not like the other presidents and it's not going to happen under President Trump [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=164.57999999999998s)]
*  It's just not gonna happen after all of the abuses they've [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=169.79999999999998s)]
*  perpetrated China's attempting to [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=173.48s)]
*  Impose additional unjustified tariffs just so you understand they all got rich because of tariffs, you know now when we do it [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=175.84s)]
*  Oh, it's so terrible what Trump is doing. It's so terrible. They got rich and not only China many countries [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=182.44s)]
*  I mean you look at Vietnam you look at so many I could name [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=189.16s)]
*  50 right now [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=193.07999999999998s)]
*  Biden couldn't do that. He couldn't name any name one country name any country. What's the name of our country? He doesn't know [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  That's why additional tariffs on Chinese goods are in place effective midnight tonight at a hundred and four percent [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=202.92s)]
*  I don't think I still till they make it. I still can't believe he's doing this. I don't know if he's gonna do this [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=209.84s)]
*  Maybe they'll lie and act like China called or something because this right here [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=217.16s)]
*  It's this is a death sentence for like [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=222.04s)]
*  So many companies dude [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=225.56s)]
*  To our Treasury this is all taxes and I mean don't let them keep telling you that this is in tax on our people [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=228.24s)]
*  I hate that you know, they say it's a tax [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=235.08s)]
*  No often much of it is paid and and hey look what happened during my first term. We had no inflation and [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=236.66s)]
*  Yet I took in [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=244.28s)]
*  Hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs and taxes from China. No other president got 10 cents in [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=245.92s)]
*  Tariffs or taxes from China. I got hundreds of billions of dollars [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=254.2s)]
*  Hundreds of billions of dollars and I still got along with them [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=259.4s)]
*  Because they understood what they were doing was wrong. They understood it [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=263.0s)]
*  It's when you explain it they sit they say I've had numerous leaders tell me [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=267.36s)]
*  You're right, sir. I was waiting for you to bring this up deals that were made by [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=274.20000000000005s)]
*  Predecessors as president were so bad. You almost wonder who did these deals. They were either crooked or stupid [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=279.52000000000004s)]
*  They can be nothing else. They were either stupid or crooked [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=285.64000000000004s)]
*  It's terrible, but it's all being changed. I change a lot of it in the first four years [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=288.56s)]
*  But it's all being changed, you know the first four years with the most successful country in history in terms of economics [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=293.16s)]
*  We had 88 percent increase in the stock markets [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=298.48s)]
*  With an 88 percent increase has never been any [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=301.84000000000003s)]
*  president that had an 88 percent increase with 88 percent and [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=306.04s)]
*  There are a lot of happy people and I think we're gonna do much better than that this time because this time I'm doing what I [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=312.48s)]
*  Want to do with respect to the tariffs? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=317.68s)]
*  I think we're gonna do much better and just remember the numbers when you get up to 2 billion a day 2 billion a day [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=319.8s)]
*  They're saying sir [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=325.52000000000004s)]
*  Can't be that can it I said yeah can it's the biggest the biggest transaction ever made [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=327.08s)]

*  I don't care how big they are compared. This is the largest transaction in the history of [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=337.4s)]
*  Our country and don't let some of these policies should go around saying, you know [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=342.15999999999997s)]
*  There's also some good news coming out of Louisiana of all places [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=346.08s)]
*  but the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=350.52s)]
*  Department of Homeland Security that thought that the Louisiana judge that would rubber stamp [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=351.71999999999997s)]
*  the deportation of Mahmoud Khalil and [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=356.92s)]
*  and anyone really for that matter has [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=360.52000000000004s)]
*  said [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=364.64000000000004s)]
*  stated today [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=365.84000000000003s)]
*  And this is from Delaney no no one at the Guardian that the Department of Homeland Security can either provide [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=367.36s)]
*  Sufficient evidence or not said the judge Jamie commons from her courtroom in Gina, Louisiana [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=373.92s)]
*  If he's not removable, I'm going to terminate this case on Friday [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=379.32s)]
*  So even the rubber stamp reactionary judges they went to is like you need to give me some evidence [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=383.8s)]
*  No percent would be paying them 104 percent [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=390.32s)]
*  That's the beauty is these guys we gotta [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=393.84s)]
*  Be careful and even the concept of it hurts your negotiation when they see a little story like that [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=396.52s)]
*  The other side, you know, it hurts your negotiation and then the fake news wants to build it up and it has no chance anyway, but [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=401.64s)]
*  We have to remain united [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=409.36s)]
*  As I defend workers from unfair trade House Republicans of a chance this week to bring trillions and trillions of dollars [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=411.64s)]
*  Pouring back into America by pushing forward with the largest tax cuts in American history [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=418.92s)]
*  Which is what you're working on right now [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=425.14s)]
*  the largest [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=427.16s)]
*  in American history and you know the reason we had because we had a great first term and [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=428.92s)]
*  Amazing first term but I saw that the other day that we had the most successful [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=435.12s)]
*  I mean I knew it anyway, but I saw that we had 88 percent increase [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=440.32s)]
*  that's a tremendous increase think of that and that's with all of the the difficulties and all of the fake investigations and the [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=444.72s)]

*  Okay, he's still got a mystery [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGuppuJ8WY&t=473.96000000000004s)]
