# ICC Issues Arrest Warrant For Israeli PM Netanyahu | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [November 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw)
*  America says jump, Israel says how high, which is precisely the reason why all this [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=0.0s)]
*  Biden is so powerless in the face of Benjamin Netanyahu conversations were so frustrating [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=4.48s)]
*  for me because yes, that's what it looked like and taking advantage of his senility [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=8.08s)]
*  and is also rabid Zionism. Having said that, however, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=13.92s)]
*  ironic also coming from a person who was defending Israel. I have never denied the Armenian Israel [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=23.52s)]
*  has just saying [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=29.84s)]
*  we're going to do it. We're going to do it. Me embrace Belden hand in hand citizens arrest [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=53.04s)]
*  for the international people's tribunal against the Benjamin and Yahoo and Yoav Galant. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=58.0s)]
*  This ideology is so weird. What ideology being against side. That's not a weird ideology. I [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=63.12s)]
*  guess it's weird if you're, if you're so used to being the normative position, you know, but I am [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=69.12s)]
*  not, regardless of how normalized it is, I will always fight against that sort of thing. So you [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  look extra Turkish today. I know I noticed that I am looking particularly like a very Arab unc [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=80.56s)]
*  coded or very Turkish unc coded. Anyway, I mean, this is my dad's jacket. So, all right, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=86.0s)]
*  let's get it started. We interrupt our programming on Al Jazeera to bring you some breaking news. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=92.24s)]
*  And the international criminal court has issued arrest warrants for Israel's prime minister, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=99.12s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister. I got to do it again. My bad. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=104.48s)]
*  For alleged war crimes in the Gaza Strip. It's also a warrants for Hamas leader, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=108.08s)]
*  Mohammed Diab al-Masri. Let's bring in Steph Varsin, who's on the phone from the Hague, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=112.72s)]
*  where those arrest warrants were issued. Talk to us about what the rejects for this, these warrants [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=118.8s)]
*  say. The arrest warrants, three arrest warrants, one for Hamas leader known as Dave and for the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=125.12s)]
*  leaders, Benjamin Netanyahu prime minister and defense minister, Yoricka Lan. The arrest warrants [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=135.68s)]
*  are for crimes against humanity and war crimes committed from at least October 8th, 2023, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=141.60000000000002s)]
*  until the request for the arrest warrants was issued by the prosecutor six months ago on May [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=150.08s)]
*  the 20th. There have been some really serious delays for issuing these arrest warrants. There [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=156.88s)]
*  was a lot of questions about if the ICC was capable of doing so despite a lot of rejections [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=164.0s)]
*  by the parties that are involved in the ICC, especially also from Europe, from Germany, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=174.24s)]
*  but also Israel has very much tried to avoid this by filing all kinds of complaints. But the ICC has [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=180.72s)]
*  now decided to reject these complaints and they have said that these arrest warrants should now [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=189.28s)]
*  be issued. And indeed there had been also a great deal of pressure step on the ICC not to issue [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=195.28s)]
*  these warrants, particularly on the Israeli government, the Israeli leadership. Why has the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=200.8s)]
*  court chosen to do so now? The question, the case is that now there is a new presiding judge of [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=206.24s)]
*  the pretrial chamber that was issuing these arrest warrants. The previous presiding judge [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=214.16000000000003s)]
*  has informed the court that she was sick, that there was a medical issue. So she recently [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=221.20000000000002s)]
*  stepped down after months of basically investigating the case and suddenly she disappeared [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=228.0s)]
*  from the case. And then a new presiding judge, a French judge, is now holding this case. And very [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=234.48000000000002s)]
*  quickly after the previous judge stepped down, this decision has now been taken. So this also [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=242.24s)]
*  gives us some answers on these delays were basically also. Real me dumb American, but why [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=248.32000000000002s)]
*  the f*** in the US a part of the ICC? What do you mean, dog? International organs of justice [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=253.68s)]
*  and the United Nations are simple tools of American hegemonic power. Okay. Or at least historically [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=259.52s)]
*  they have been used as tools for the West to enact whatever its agenda is. Unequal extraction [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=268.96s)]
*  of natural resources from the global South, permanent war against America's enemies or against [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=275.03999999999996s)]
*  enemies of the West. Okay. But today is a different day. As America's power on the global stage wanes, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=280.4s)]
*  many Americans are terrified of the prospect of a Chinese future. Okay. But in the interim period, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=289.67999999999995s)]
*  given Israel's unconscionable actions, given the Israeli government's inhumanity and consistent, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=297.35999999999996s)]
*  consistent unending regardless of America's protection, America's attack dog gets at least [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=307.44s)]
*  one mark on its track record on this otherwise stainless history. Okay. These institutions do [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=315.84s)]
*  not work against America or its allies. This is the first ever instance in my lifetime where I [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=325.76s)]
*  have seen this. Okay. This is fantastic. Okay. This is fantastic. America can try to consistently [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=333.12s)]
*  defend your try to consistently defend Israel throughout this process as they have, and they [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=342.24s)]
*  will, but this directly puts them at odds with many reasonable moral people in Europe that look [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=348.16s)]
*  towards this. Okay. Not just in your lifetime. It's the first time since world war two, it's been [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=356.96000000000004s)]
*  used against a Western nation. And I mean, that's when it was created. Like feeling this tweet right [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=361.52000000000004s)]
*  now. Yeah. Firm believer in international rule-based order right now until Biden, the Hague. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=366.96000000000004s)]
*  It is regarding Fox news, characterizing you as an American hater. It's funny because you're [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=371.36s)]
*  expressed strong critiques for all manners of nations, including China, Russia, and Saudi [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=375.04s)]
*  Arabia. It turns out you just have an unshakable moral compass and there's no home for us anywhere. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=378.40000000000003s)]
*  I know. And it's not that there's no home for us anywhere. It's that I want to fix the home that [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=383.28000000000003s)]
*  I'm in. Okay. Western nation in the center of the middle East. Brother, if you think Israel is not [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=387.6s)]
*  simply an extension of the United States of America and its imperial ambitions in the region, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=393.28000000000003s)]
*  I don't know what to tell you. You might've been in a f**king column over the past year. Okay. Hello? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=397.6s)]
*  Israel is America. Just letting you know, Israel is not just any Western nation. It is America. It [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=403.92s)]
*  is an extension of the United States of America. America says jump. Israel says how high, which is [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=411.52000000000004s)]
*  precisely the reason why all this Biden is so powerless in the face of Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=417.28000000000003s)]
*  conversations were so frustrating for me because yes, that's what it looked like. And taking [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=421.28000000000003s)]
*  advantage of his senility and is also rabid Zionism. Having said that, however, having said that, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=426.16s)]
*  however, ultimately this was still a part of America's imperial ambition. And I think they [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=433.92s)]
*  overstepped. This is why I said Palestine and Israel's j**t side over Palestinians has laid [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=439.36s)]
*  bare for all to see the Western world's depravity. Okay. Straight up, straight up. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=447.76s)]
*  Things are changing. The entire world is witnessing a, in my opinion, very consequential [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=456.16s)]
*  change in the way things have worked so far. Is the arrest warrant released after the SAKs [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=463.44s)]
*  of the ICJ? No. The International Court of Justice prosecutes nations. The International [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=469.44s)]
*  Criminal Court prosecutes people. So the ICC prosecution is for individuals. Okay. It's for [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=475.12s)]
*  individuals that happen to be in charge of nations doing a j**t side. Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=482.64s)]
*  ICC warrants are anti-Semitic and are absurd and false lies contrary to a true lie, I guess. So it's [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=487.2s)]
*  true. And for the record, a lot of people say, Hassan, you say America bad, but why do you always [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=491.52s)]
*  say America bad, but you never follow it up? Well, those people go la la la la. I can't hear you when [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=497.68s)]
*  I follow it up. Okay. You must understand something very important right now. It is not an accident [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=502.0s)]
*  that every single f**king Senator and every single Congress person in the United States of America, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=509.03999999999996s)]
*  with the exception of like a handful, are currently tweeting like they're f**king Sephiroth. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=513.92s)]
*  They're all out there tweeting like anime villains. They're, they're [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=518.7199999999999s)]
*  baying for blood. They're seeing red. They're like, we have to, we have to n**p the Hague. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=522.4s)]
*  Down to the wire, down to the likes of Thomas Cotton. The ICC is a kangaroo court and Kareem [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=527.76s)]
*  Khan is a deranged fanatic. Woe to him and anyone who tries to enforce these outlaw warrants. Let me [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=533.12s)]
*  give them all a friendly reminder. The American law on the ICC is known as the Hague Invasion Act [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=538.64s)]
*  for a reason. Think about it. They're cackling. All right. God, God damn. I misspelled villain [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=543.9200000000001s)]
*  because I was so excited. I fixed it. Shut up. Holy f**king s**t. Just saying that out loud. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=551.6800000000001s)]
*  Tom Cotton has literally talked about using the military on Black Lives Matter protestors, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=556.24s)]
*  wrote about it on the New York Times. Tom Cotton has also talked about killing pro-Palestinian [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=560.64s)]
*  protestors in climate change protestors. Tom Cotton does not give a f**k. He is a straightforward [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=565.12s)]
*  Nazi. Tom Cotton very famously, if you guys recall, was the guy who pulled up the Singaporean [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=570.0s)]
*  CEO of TikTok to be like, what kind of Chinese are you boy? How Chinese are you boy? You know, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=578.72s)]
*  that sort of thing. He is a f**king virulent racist piece of s**t. Now I will not be posting [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=584.72s)]
*  the Shinzo Abe tweet that I very famously once posted about Tom Cotton because I don't want to [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=590.08s)]
*  get in trouble. Of course, only Americans believe they're the good guys even in Europe across all [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=595.44s)]
*  political spectrum. I've seen people s**t on the USA. Yes, and it is well deserved. It is well [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=599.44s)]
*  f**king deserved. For those who like to, you know, for all the America good actually, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=606.4000000000001s)]
*  understanders, this is going to be a very hard day of cope. They will turn around and say, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=612.4000000000001s)]
*  oh, America's still good. The ICC, maybe they are anti-Semitic. Maybe they're Hamas. Maybe they got [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=619.0400000000001s)]
*  Hamas tunnels under there, you know? Anyway, the US rejected the warrant. We knew that they [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=624.8s)]
*  were going to reject the warrant. They have been actively pressuring the ICC's warrant application [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=629.68s)]
*  to not go through until this very moment. So that is not surprising to me, nor is it shocking to me. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=633.92s)]
*  America can say whatever the f**k it wants. They will cope and they will see. Okay. EU secretary of [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=639.76s)]
*  state. Oh God, I'm so, I'm so hard right now. I'm not even hard. I'm just elated. Okay. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=645.68s)]
*  Oh my God. All right. Oh, so good. So f**king good. Oh, I feel so f**king good. We're playing [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=654.8s)]
*  propaganda again. Yes. This is a very famous pro-Palestinian song. So of course it's inherently [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=669.92s)]
*  going to be considered anti-Semitic because the existence of Palestine and the existence of [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=677.92s)]
*  Palestinians and any sort of mention of Palestine or Palestinians is inherently anti-Semitic [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=681.92s)]
*  according to those who choose to silence any sort of f**king criticism. So do they also disagree [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=686.4799999999999s)]
*  with the decision to issue warrants against Hamas leaders? No, that part also is like so [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=693.4399999999999s)]
*  inconsequential in the grand scheme of things because that part is expected. The unexpected [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=698.4799999999999s)]
*  part is that someone that is firmly within the American sphere of influence, but not necessarily [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=703.1999999999999s)]
*  just in the American sphere of influence, but also protected by the American government so [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=710.88s)]
*  thoroughly could ever be declared a war criminal. This is unique. This is new. This is a welcomed [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=715.76s)]
*  correction. Okay. Oh my God. Also most of the f**king Palestinian leadership that they [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=723.12s)]
*  declared war criminals for October 7 have been assassinated by Israel regardless. So this was a, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=730.48s)]
*  this is exactly what I thought as well. State department press briefing canceled for today. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=736.4s)]
*  Oh no. Oh no. Yeah. On Adami Falashtini means my blood is Palestinian by the way. Please do not [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=741.2s)]
*  laugh at this. State departments only do this when they are in great distress. Okay. Citizens [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=749.6s)]
*  arrest time, baby. Citizens arrest time, baby. Buying time because now with the new charge, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=753.84s)]
*  apparently there was no more hesitation and he took this decision together with two other churches. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=761.4399999999999s)]
*  Remind our viewers, Sepp, of what the Israeli government and his former defense minister, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=767.44s)]
*  as well as the Hamas leader who's also been issued an arrest warrant with what exactly are they being [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=772.5600000000001s)]
*  accused of? Yeah, these are the crimes against humanity and war crimes. And what the prosecutor [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=778.4000000000001s)]
*  really laid out last May was that starving the population of Gaza was a very important [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=785.36s)]
*  point for him to ask for these arrest warrants, but also something I noticed in my EU country [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=793.68s)]
*  subreddit suddenly seemed to be much more pro-Palestine after this warrant. Typical [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=798.9599999999999s)]
*  s**t just a week ago. It was, it was people who are pro-Israel. Yeah. A lot of liberals do care [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=801.76s)]
*  about these institutions. Okay. They have not had the same cynical framework that I have been [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=808.16s)]
*  operating with because I wasn't just cynical. I was just realistic about the way things work. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=815.3599999999999s)]
*  So of course they do care about that sort of thing. So it'll be much, much, much harder for them, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=822.32s)]
*  I think, to, to defend this s**t. The fact that there have been a murder attacks, of course, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=829.2800000000001s)]
*  from the Israeli army. But one of the things that really stood out was the fact that the [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=837.44s)]
*  Israeli authorities and the Israeli army have been starving the population of Gaza. And that's [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=843.6s)]
*  something that's a very specific war crime that also has already some experience at the ICC in [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=849.84s)]
*  previous cases. So I think the prosecutor hopes that there will be a lot of evidence that he can [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=857.12s)]
*  use for, to prove this case. Okay. We know that Israel doesn't accept the jurisdiction of the ICC, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=862.4s)]
*  doesn't recognize the jurisdiction of the ICC. So what will this mean for this case against the [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=871.52s)]
*  Israeli leadership, Netanyahu and former defense minister Galant? This will mean that every country [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=878.16s)]
*  that is part of the ICC and from the top of my head, these are now 40 countries, they have the [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=884.4s)]
*  obligation to arrest Netanyahu, Galant and Dave when they come across these individuals. So this [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=890.64s)]
*  will mean in practice that it's going to be very difficult for Netanyahu to travel and Galant as [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=899.28s)]
*  well to travel abroad because the countries that are members of the ICC, for example, Germany, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=907.36s)]
*  the UK, a lot of European countries as well, but also countries across the globe have the obligation [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=913.52s)]
*  to arrest them and hand them over to the Hague, to the court. Okay, Steph, for the moment. Thank you [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=919.6800000000001s)]
*  very much. Ali, great to have you with us. First, has there been any reaction to this so far in Israel? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=925.52s)]
*  I'm losing my fucking mind, dude. I'm losing my fucking mind. I'm shocked. Okay, I'm shocked. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=932.8000000000001s)]
*  I'm actually straight up surprised in the most pleasant way possible. I saw that article like [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=940.4s)]
*  last week or two weeks ago when Israel, when Mossad was trying to do a last ditch effort [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=949.12s)]
*  and they were like, Hey, why don't we, why don't we just like say Kareem Khan is actually doing [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=954.1600000000001s)]
*  rapes all the time? The prosecutor that ironically enough, and this is the ICC prosecutor that was [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=960.32s)]
*  replaced originally, it was a lady by the name of Ben Suda who was literally straight up intimidated [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=967.9200000000001s)]
*  by Mossad. This is all straight up real shit that Israel did for even daring to investigate Israel's [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=978.24s)]
*  war crimes. So this has been an ongoing incident. Okay, for a long time, the ICC, the International [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=987.52s)]
*  Criminal Court was investigating Israel for apartheid and for war crimes for quite a while. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=993.68s)]
*  The person who was prosecuting them potentially was harassed, intimidated, surveilled, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=999.4399999999999s)]
*  and Benjamin Netanyahu got Donald Trump to place sanctions on her individually. It was insane. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1006.72s)]
*  So then America and Israel were like, let's put a different guy on there. Let's put our guy on [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1013.6s)]
*  there. A guy that we like his name, Kareem Khan. Okay. These clips out of context are going to go [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1018.96s)]
*  wild on Fox news. Oh yeah. They're going to be like Hassan supports terrorism because he's [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1024.72s)]
*  celebrating the International Criminal Court actually doing fucking real prosecutions for [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1029.68s)]
*  once. Really? Okay. Wow. That's crazy, man. I can't believe my fucking haters that say, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1034.56s)]
*  I want to do 9-11 over and over again are going to use this as an opportunity to fucking yell [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1040.16s)]
*  about me again. It does not matter. The truth does not change. This is what I tried to explain [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1046.0s)]
*  to people yesterday when we were reading the Fox news cancel piece, the hit piece. Yeah. Look, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1052.88s)]
*  look at that. Look at the fucking retaliation award-winning investigative journalists fighting [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1058.88s)]
*  for the truth. ICC judges. We know that in reality we did not have jurisdiction. Well, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1063.28s)]
*  let's try and arrest the Jews anyway. The RCC is a rent anti-Semitic kangaroo court. Fucking hell. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1069.36s)]
*  Fucking hell. They want to fucking arrest us for doing a bit of war crimes. Oh, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1078.56s)]
*  fucking hell in it. I'm an investigative reporter. By the way, we're going to be covering the harrowing [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1085.28s)]
*  nature of Israel's crimes once again, but something to remember. Israeli prime minister also called it [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1091.04s)]
*  anti-Semitic. The anti-Semitic decision of the international criminal court has a modern Dreyfus [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1097.92s)]
*  trial and will end the same way. Israel utterly rejects the false and absurd charges of the [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1103.36s)]
*  international criminal court, a biased and discriminatory political body. No war is more [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1109.12s)]
*  just than the war Israel has been waging in Gaza since October 7th, 2023, when Hamas terrorist [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1114.3999999999999s)]
*  organization launched a murderous assault and perpetrated the largest massacre against the [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1121.28s)]
*  Jewish people since the Holocaust. The decision to issue an arrest warrant against the prime minister [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1124.8s)]
*  was made by a corrupt chief prosecutor who was trying to save himself from sexual harassment. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1129.52s)]
*  See, this is what I mean, bro. Immediately, immediately they were like, hmm, what can we do [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1133.9199999999998s)]
*  here? What can we do about Kareem Khan? Oh, he's a sexual assaulter actually. And it was funny [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1139.44s)]
*  because like even Western media that normally would, you know, jump to cover these sorts of [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1146.08s)]
*  things because they love this sort of shit. We're like, yeah, uh, while the, well, you know, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1152.24s)]
*  we want to take the allegations seriously. It did. The timing of them were quite interesting [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1158.08s)]
*  and it could be potentially a made up by Israel. Like, come on, dude, come on, dude, come on. He [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1164.72s)]
*  said, he said, calling us war criminals for doing a genocide is anti-Semitic. Also, you're a sexual [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1175.84s)]
*  harasser. Um, the ICC prosecutor lied when he told American senators that he would take no action [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1181.76s)]
*  until he had visited Israel and heard its side. Instead, he canceled his arrival in Israel. Uh, [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1187.52s)]
*  last May, several days after suspicions of sexual harassment were made against him and [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1192.64s)]
*  announces intention to issue arrest warrants against prime minister and former defense minister. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1195.6s)]
*  No anti-Israel decision will prevent the state of Israel from defending its citizens. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1199.44s)]
*  Notice how he's mentioning sexual harassment twice now. Okay. It's just like, I think the sexual [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1202.64s)]
*  assault allegations are actually credible, but it's obviously irrelevant as to whether [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1208.72s)]
*  Netanyahu is guilty. Look, man, all I'm going to say is this, okay. It has no bearing on [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1211.76s)]
*  Kareem Khan's prosecution of Israel. Okay. It's also rather odd coming from the fucking state [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1218.1599999999999s)]
*  that literally was like, Oh shit, we might actually get in trouble. Let's use complementarity to our [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1228.48s)]
*  advantage and prosecute some of the people that were doing mass rapes in the prisons. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1234.96s)]
*  And then they couldn't even do that because they had an armed January 6th style rebellion [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1241.2s)]
*  where they fucking forcibly freed the rapist and made him a television star. The Israeli [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1247.52s)]
*  Knesset members turned around and were like talking about how, you know, yeah, no, you don't [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1254.8s)]
*  understand. Actually the IDF does have a right to rape Palestinians. The fuck are you talking about? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1259.1200000000001s)]
*  Get the fuck out of here. They had a rape January 6th, man. The fuck do you mean? So many motherfuckers [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1263.76s)]
*  have no way of looking at a situation like this and immediately jump and immediately jump to like [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1269.6s)]
*  whatever. Like it works. It works for a lot of you. Look, I've never read a Western report, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1276.96s)]
*  a Western media report. Okay. That immediately was like there were sexual harassment allegations, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1283.2s)]
*  but the timing of that is very suspicious considering how much Israel has tried to intervene [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1290.16s)]
*  in the ICC. Like, I'm sorry, they could be credible. They could. Okay. But if you think [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1296.96s)]
*  this has any bearing on this prosecution, you are fucking delusional and you're the biggest goddamn [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1304.88s)]
*  mark, the biggest sucker, the biggest rube of all time. Okay. Ridiculous. Fucking ridiculous. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1310.0800000000002s)]
*  Anyway, it's like the former prosecutor, they tried, they literally personally harassed the [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1316.64s)]
*  former prosecutor before Kareem Khan. You understand that, right? Like they surveilled [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1323.68s)]
*  the former prosecutor before Kareem Khan. They got America to place sanctions on the former [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1328.24s)]
*  prosecutor before Kareem Khan. And you have to remember it's not just Kareem Khan either. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1334.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, they were stalking her. I covered it extensively. Israeli spy chief threatened [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1339.44s)]
*  ICC prosecutor over war crimes inquiry. They tapped their fucking phones to see exactly what [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1344.8s)]
*  she was actually going to create a case around so they could go back and like do some sort of [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1350.8799999999999s)]
*  prosecution to be like, yeah, what are you talking about? You can't interfere in our affairs. We're a [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1357.36s)]
*  Democrat. We're a democratic organization. We have democratic governance. We actually investigate our [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1361.9199999999998s)]
*  own war crimes, specifically the ones that, you know, we figured out by surveilling and tapping [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1366.56s)]
*  the phones of the former ICC prosecutor Fatou Ben Souda to see exactly which war crimes she was [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1371.52s)]
*  actually focusing on so that we could actually use complementarity to our advantage as a deflection, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1379.52s)]
*  as a shield. It's fucking insane. Okay. The well is endless for depravity. Okay, dude, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1385.28s)]
*  you're fucking insane. Anyway, so just to help you understand a little bit about like, you know, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1391.84s)]
*  what is going on here and there's a lot to talk about, but here, let's see what the ICC warrants [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1400.16s)]
*  mean. There hasn't been any reaction officially from this new office. I have texted officials [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1405.8400000000001s)]
*  close to the Israeli prime minister, but there's been no reaction yet, but we know or we can predict [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1411.8400000000001s)]
*  how they will react. Given that when the chief prosecutor for the international criminal court, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1416.48s)]
*  Kareem Khan, who's a British lawyer first sought these arrest warrants, it was met with a lot of [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1421.1200000000001s)]
*  anger and frankly disbelief by senior members of the Israeli government and a lot of people [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1427.6s)]
*  in Israel as well. They were disgusted at the idea that the ICC could be investigating Israeli [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1434.0s)]
*  leaders for war crimes when it was Hamas that carried out the October the seventh attacks, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1442.3999999999999s)]
*  but the initial request by the chief prosecutor to the ICC included as well as Netanyahu and the [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1447.6s)]
*  former now defense minister, Yov Geland. It included the two Hamas leaders, Yahuas Sinwa [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1455.28s)]
*  and Ismael Haniyeh, where they're now both dead, killed by Israel, so they're no longer on the [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1461.2s)]
*  charge sheet as it were. Mohammed Daif, another senior member, commander of Hamas, an arrest [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1467.12s)]
*  warrant has been issued for him as well. Israel says that they had killed him, but Hamas have not [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1473.6s)]
*  confirmed it officially. So effectively three arrest warrants have been issued by the international [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1478.56s)]
*  criminal court, but the two most significant those against Benjamin Netanyahu and Yov Geland. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1484.8s)]
*  The court in their statement they released said that they have reasonable grounds to believe that [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1490.72s)]
*  those two men have been carrying out the war crime of starvation as a method of warfare [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1497.04s)]
*  and the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution and other inhumane acts. Now it's [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1502.56s)]
*  been quite a lengthy process to get to this point ever since the arrest warrants were first sought [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1509.04s)]
*  about six or seven months ago. There've been a lot of legal challenges in particular [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1517.12s)]
*  by the Israelis against the, firstly, the authority of the court to do this. The Israelis argue that [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1522.48s)]
*  the court doesn't have an authority to pursue claims related to Israel because they're not a [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1528.1599999999999s)]
*  signatory or the Palestinian, but the court rejected that and said they do have jurisdiction [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1534.72s)]
*  over Palestinian territory. There's also been question marks over one of the judges on the panel [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1541.28s)]
*  and their suitability to take one of these decisions and whether or not they were suitably [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1547.28s)]
*  independent, but the court has rejected all that and has now issued these arrest warrants. So what [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1554.48s)]
*  does it mean? Well, practically it would mean that Benjamin Netanyahu and Joao de Galan [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1561.68s)]
*  couldn't travel to any state that is a signatory of the International Criminal Court. There's [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1567.92s)]
*  around 120 countries around the world, including many European countries, including the United [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1573.6000000000001s)]
*  Kingdom, and by rights, at least according to what those countries have signed up to, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1579.52s)]
*  were Netanyahu to travel to any of those countries, he should be arrested by the police forces of [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1586.08s)]
*  those countries. And it'd be very interesting to see actually whether or what Keir Starmer and the [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1592.8s)]
*  labor party government's reaction is to this Starmer human rights lawyer by trade shortly after [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1597.12s)]
*  labor came to power, they actually removed an objection or a question mark that the [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1603.84s)]
*  what Gideon Levy take that scares me. Netanyahu, the ultimate victim in the eyes of many Israelis. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1608.0s)]
*  Oh, no, they're fucking fascist leader that they only have increased in popularity as he's killed [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1612.96s)]
*  more babies is going to become more popular now in Israel. Yeah, I know. I don't give a fuck. Okay. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1620.16s)]
*  Fuck him. Now he can't go to Europe. Suck my dick. Now we can't go to Canada. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1628.0s)]
*  Fuck you, Benjamin Netanyahu. Okay. The only place you can travel to is going to be, you know, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1632.08s)]
*  the United States of America. I guess they're sweating now. Levy Gideon Levy told Al Jazeera, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1637.92s)]
*  he said the warrants also have a much broader meaning for Israel, the Israeli army for individual [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1643.1200000000001s)]
*  soldiers and officers because they can snowball to include more people. However, Israel today is [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1646.4s)]
*  united in condemning the ICC for almost wall to wall. Levy said very few in Israel are asking, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1650.5600000000002s)]
*  how do we get to this point? He said many Israelis don't see anything wrong with the behavior of [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1655.1200000000001s)]
*  Israel and Gaza. Levy believes Netanyahu's popularity in Israel may increase in the coming days because [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1658.0800000000002s)]
*  he is now the ultimate victim. Now it's him against the whole world and Israelis feel that he [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1662.4s)]
*  represents all of them. I mean, they did. His popularity only increased when he did shit like [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1666.24s)]
*  this. Okay. So yeah, we didn't arrive at this conclusion yesterday. This didn't happen overnight. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1671.28s)]
*  It was a long path with fascist acceleration happening in Israel day in and day out, especially [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1677.28s)]
*  amplified through Benjamin Netanyahu's reign over Israel in the past 30 fucking years. If he actually [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1686.08s)]
*  tried to travel to those places, what are the odds he would actually be arrested? I would love to see [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1692.48s)]
*  it. No, I don't think it's zero. I think he's just not going to go to those places. I don't think it's [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1697.44s)]
*  zero. Like people point to Vladimir Putin, who also is a war criminal and has a warrant out for his [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1702.4s)]
*  arrest traveling to Mongolia. I don't think that's the same. I don't think that Vladimir Putin going [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1707.92s)]
*  to Mongolia, which is supposed to abide by the Rome statute and not fucking arresting Vladimir Putin [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1712.96s)]
*  is the same as Benjamin Netanyahu going to the fucking heart of Europe. Mongolia is a little [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1718.6399999999999s)]
*  bit different than I believe South Africa, for example. Did he not? Did he? Didn't Vladimir Putin [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1722.72s)]
*  not go to South Africa? Yeah, it's serious, man. It's not like that. It's not. I mean, we talk about [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1727.52s)]
*  like, we talk about how feckless of an institution the UN is, right? And in many respects is true [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1733.28s)]
*  because the Security Council trumps all and the Security Council is dominated by a singular veto [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1738.24s)]
*  power in the hands of the United States of America. Okay. Having said that, however, [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1743.04s)]
*  this is an escalation. This is one step above that. Okay. The ICC is a pretty, I mean, it's a pretty [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1747.84s)]
*  solid, well-respected institution. And while it's, you know, while its influence can be limited in [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1756.8s)]
*  a place like fucking Mongolia, which is very limited in what it can and can't do, right. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1762.3999999999999s)]
*  And the ICC itself doesn't have like, you know, it's not going to, they're not going to use like [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1769.68s)]
*  Interpol or whatever, but they do have a network of laws in place for exactly this, exactly this [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1773.6000000000001s)]
*  situation happening. Now, the interesting part about this is that it is in American law to invade [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1781.52s)]
*  the Hague if Israel or any Israeli or any American ally ever gets prosecuted in the ICC. This is real. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1788.0800000000002s)]
*  This is a very real law in the American books. Okay. Something that I've talked about quite a bit. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1797.12s)]
*  Not a rule that you would have if you're a good guy. Historically, historically good guys don't [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1803.36s)]
*  have, we will fucking blow up the International Criminal Court in their books as a rule. Okay. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1808.1599999999999s)]
*  The Hague Invasion Act is an act that allows the president to order US military actions, [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1814.24s)]
*  such as the invasion of the Netherlands, where the Hague is located to protect American officials [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1818.08s)]
*  and military personnel from prosecution and rescue them from custody. Yeah. But that in and [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1821.44s)]
*  of itself would make America the enemy of the entire Western world. Okay. I don't think they [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1827.52s)]
*  have motion like that. Remember something that I've told you about soft power over and over again, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1834.24s)]
*  soft power and hard power work hard in hand, hand in hand. Okay. Soft power and hard power work [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1840.8s)]
*  together. All of a sudden 800 military bases can look like 800 different invasions. Okay. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1847.44s)]
*  800 military bases will look like a collaborative security partnership as long as America is [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1854.8s)]
*  seemingly abiding by the rules or not going so far, you know, not just getting too far out of pocket. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1862.16s)]
*  Okay. Yeah. You can invade Libya, for example, you bomb Libya with some NATO troops or whatever the [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1869.04s)]
*  fuck you can go into Iraq and go in Afghanistan. But if you go into the Netherlands, well, that's [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1874.24s)]
*  an entirely different situation. You can have that law in your books. Okay, as a threat. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1879.52s)]
*  Okay, you can have that law in your books as a threat. Following through on that threat is [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1887.84s)]
*  entirely different. Now, do I think Donald Trump would do such a thing? Maybe who knows? He's a [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1893.04s)]
*  fucking psycho. Okay, he's an absolute psychopath. Perhaps a reasonable person who is maybe not [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1898.96s)]
*  demented, who cares about the future of this country and every other country and maybe even [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1908.16s)]
*  maintaining a shred of decency for the United States of America, what remains would try to pack [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1916.16s)]
*  this entire situation up before it gets completely out of hand and then Donald Trump is the one with [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1922.0s)]
*  the reins of power, but they're not going to do that because Joe Biden is a ultra nationalist for [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1926.88s)]
*  Israel. The previous British government had submitted to the international criminal court, [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1933.92s)]
*  but the United States, obviously Israel's closest ally, they are not a signatory of the ICC. So in [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1938.88s)]
*  theory, Nesson who would still be able to travel to the United States, a country that he has such [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1946.0s)]
*  a long affiliation with a country where he grew up in, went to school in, in his early years. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1951.2800000000002s)]
*  And we've already seen from the incoming Republican administration in the United States, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1956.24s)]
*  threats to sanction the ICC were they to proceed with this. So I think Netanyahu will have support [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1962.56s)]
*  on the other side of the Atlantic. Also, these ICC arrest warrants don't always get carried out. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1969.76s)]
*  We saw President Putin, who had an arrest warrant issued for him after the invasion of Ukraine, [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1977.28s)]
*  traveled to Mongolia a couple of months ago and nothing was done about that. He wasn't arrested [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1981.76s)]
*  when he landed in Mongolia. But in terms of the reputation of Benjamin Netanyahu and Yov Galant, [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1985.68s)]
*  in terms of their legacy, they are now wanted suspects, wanted to be put on trial for war crimes. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=1993.44s)]
*  And it is a label that will never leave them and object to it as strongly as no doubt they will do. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2001.68s)]
*  Nonetheless, a body of such the international criminal court has an idea. I have an idea. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2010.88s)]
*  Okay. I have an idea. What if you didn't do any of the war crimes and you just stopped [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2018.48s)]
*  and then you volunteered yourself to be put in, you know, some sort of confinement so that the [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2024.48s)]
*  prosecution could be conducted and then went to jail for the rest of your life. If that's, you know, [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2031.92s)]
*  what they choose to do. I'm just saying, you know, if you're, if you're innocent, go defend [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2037.76s)]
*  yourself, go defend yourself in court. Right? I mean, that's what, that's what you would do [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2043.28s)]
*  right in this situation. Decided after many months of weighing up the evidence, evidence to request [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2047.36s)]
*  arrest warrants against Israel's prime minister and former defense minister. And Ali, you say [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2055.2s)]
*  there's been no reaction. This part is a little bit more tricky, but yes, Netanyahu would not be able [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2059.92s)]
*  to fly over Europe because they could potentially, they could potentially send jets like fighter jets [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2066.48s)]
*  to forcibly land his plane. Or if he has any sort of emergency landing due to mechanical or [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2074.56s)]
*  health reasons, he would, you know, plausibly have to go to jail. Now, I don't think that they [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2080.72s)]
*  would actually fucking force, like, I don't think they would send fighter jets the force his plan [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2085.6s)]
*  to land. Like I think that's a, that's a bit much. There are direct flights from Tel Aviv, the JFK. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2090.4s)]
*  No, I, I'm just saying the opportunities are endless. I'm not saying it's going to happen. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2095.76s)]
*  You should check the New York times homepage right now. Oh yeah. I'm sure they're not covering this [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2101.84s)]
*  story. It's probably not that important. It's probably like around, you know, third, fourth, [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2107.36s)]
*  fifth, most important. Matt Gaines withdraws attorney general pick was a big story to be fair [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2114.96s)]
*  inside the lobbying career of Trump's new chief of staff. Okay. That's weird. Pete Hegzett, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2120.48s)]
*  clean energy, Putin threat to West. Oh, it's not even under the fold. It's like, oh, oh, wow. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2124.72s)]
*  Oh, wow. It's like a multiple scrolls past. Wow. It's not even in the top three or four news stories [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2132.08s)]
*  in the country. It's the fifth Nanny. I was arrested by international criminal court. Hmm. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2138.8799999999997s)]
*  That's interesting. Arrest sought by court. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2144.3999999999996s)]
*  ...to it yet. But as you point out, when the restaurants were requested by current come back [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2146.8799999999997s)]
*  in May, there was a lot of pushback from these reddies because as we've seen, there were those [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2153.28s)]
*  two appeals that were put in place that the ICC rejected today. Now it's a de facto travel ban [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2159.36s)]
*  for those countries that are part of the Rome statue, part of the ICC. But I think the first [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2164.88s)]
*  requirement is on is on national courts to bring in that arrest warrant as well. And of course, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2171.28s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu has his issue. Honestly, surprise your hippies didn't end up higher. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2178.0s)]
*  I know as yours was in a different section, New York times, not going to do a hit piece on me. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2181.68s)]
*  They're not that depraved. Okay. That's like, leave that to leave that shit to the fucking Fox [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2185.04s)]
*  news in the New York post of the world. Okay. That's a little bit different. New York times, [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2190.48s)]
*  not going to do a hit piece on me yet. Let's just say, boom, easy money, baby. You come in here, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2195.04s)]
*  you say some dumb shit, you know, clap, get clap. One silly question I have for all the people that [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2201.44s)]
*  have just not been paying attention to anything that's going on in the world. I wonder if they [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2208.24s)]
*  will at any moment go, Hey, maybe I should stop watching these fucking drama farmers who are [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2212.16s)]
*  either pro Israel or noticeably absent from the conversation until there's an opportunity to shit [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2218.24s)]
*  on Hassan for being a critic of Israel. Probably not. What please ban me as well. I'll stop watching [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2224.08s)]
*  you then. No, you will not get banned until you say some bigoted shit. Shoes with these ready [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2231.12s)]
*  courts at the moment. There are still those outstanding cases against him. And I'm not [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2236.8s)]
*  suggesting for a moment that an Israeli court would try and follow through on this arrest from [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2240.96s)]
*  the ICC. But does this in any way build on some of the domestic pressure that Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2245.2000000000003s)]
*  may be facing in that regard? You're right. I don't see a situation where the Israeli high court, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2250.6400000000003s)]
*  for example, will demand the arrest domestically of either Netanyahu or Galant, but you never know [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2256.88s)]
*  what might happen in the future. And that will always play on Netanyahu. You never know what a [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2263.44s)]
*  court might do in five years. Hence 10 years. Hence, for example, I think there are cases, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2268.48s)]
*  I think there is precedent for courts in [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2273.44s)]
*  I told you that he was absolutely enemy and should be shunned from the left. Got a weak ban for it. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2276.96s)]
*  When she voted to make it illegal to not Sam calm Israel. Hi, I am vindicated. She voted to put you [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2280.7200000000003s)]
*  in jail, bro. What will it take for you to condemn her? Well, she didn't, she did not do that. She [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2286.64s)]
*  voted for a, I hate anti-Semitism messaging bill that was a, not even a bill. It was a resolution [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2292.72s)]
*  to urge to adopt the IHRA definition and codify it. She has in the past struck down and voted [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2299.6s)]
*  against IHRA codification bills and she will continue to do so. I still do think that AOC's, [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2306.64s)]
*  like even on a messaging bill like that, the fact that I was he voted yay on it is still, [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2315.3599999999997s)]
*  is not, it's just ridiculous. I think having said that, however, if you think that she would vote to [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2320.0s)]
*  put forth a bill that would put me in jail, that vote would also put her in jail as well, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2327.84s)]
*  which is why I thought it was very silly. We talked about this yesterday. Like my criticisms [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2332.5600000000004s)]
*  of AOC are, you know, I think fairly reasonable way. She voted for the nonprofit killer. Fuck. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2337.76s)]
*  No, that's the point. She voted against the nonprofit killer. She voted against the former [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2344.64s)]
*  IHRA definition bill. Of course she's not going to vote for the IHRA definition bill. This is a [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2349.3599999999997s)]
*  messaging bill. It's like a, Oh, I don't like anti-Semitism is the way that they present it. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2355.2799999999997s)]
*  And then there's an, there's urging to put the IHRA definition sneaking into that anti anti-Semitism [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2360.72s)]
*  bill. I still maintain the position that she should not have voted yay on it. Okay. She should not [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2368.4s)]
*  have, but this is not, this is not a, a, what do you call it? This is not like a, like a binding [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2374.08s)]
*  bill that will, that will implement the IHRA definition, the resolution that urges for there [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2381.6s)]
*  to be a binding, a binding bill that, that actually adopts the IHRA definition. And I don't think she [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2388.24s)]
*  would vote for that. And I know she has literally voted against it in the past, as we looked at [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2397.6s)]
*  yesterday. This is not a defensive AOC. I am still, I am still against her voting on, on this bill. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2403.52s)]
*  Anyway, we'll get to that in a second. Stop defending. Shut the fuck up, dude. My job [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2411.2s)]
*  is to tell you the fucking truth. I am, I do not appreciate nor do I think she did the right thing. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2416.0s)]
*  Why the fuck are we talking about? AOC is a moment of happiness. Shut the fuck up. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2424.24s)]
*  My job is to explain to you things so you don't get fucking geared because you saw a bunch of [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2428.08s)]
*  wonderful people that I also like. Okay. On Twitter immediately go AOC wants to throw you in jail [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2433.68s)]
*  for criticizing Israel. Okay. I don't want you to be air headed leftists that get duped by fucking [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2440.08s)]
*  memes. So I'm going to tell you what the truth is. Okay. This is not a defensive AOC. I don't think [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2447.7599999999998s)]
*  she did the right thing there at all. I think she did the wrong thing by voting yay on this message [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2453.68s)]
*  bill. Anyway, let's continue countries to arrest their own systems, their own past leaders and [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2458.48s)]
*  deport them to the Hague. But it's not something I can see happening in the current state in Israel. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2469.84s)]
*  I think this will make negotiations. If the bill wasn't binding, then who give, then why give a [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2477.84s)]
*  fuck? No, I do give a fuck. I think it's stupid to vote in favor of bills like that. And part of the [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2483.28s)]
*  reason why I think it's stupid is because it's like the anti socialist messaging bill that the [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2489.36s)]
*  Democrats voted on as well. And I never forgot Ro Khanna voting against it. Or I mean, voting for [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2492.6400000000003s)]
*  it. Democrats are firmly committed to fighting socialism is like a dumb ass fucking messaging [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2497.28s)]
*  bill that you don't have to fucking vote yes on. Anyway, didn't even say this guy was the voice of [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2502.96s)]
*  reason in the cabinet. Yes. He doesn't know anything like please. And he also apologized for [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2506.96s)]
*  saying that. Okay. I'm like, please guys, come on. Yes. Ethan, regardless of the way he presents [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2511.52s)]
*  himself or has presented himself from in this entire process is like, I think a lot of you think [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2520.48s)]
*  that he's just like actively, you know, knowledgeable on this stuff. And it's just like firmly committed [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2527.6s)]
*  to a position. Like I think he's just, again, this is also not a defensive Ethan who has actively tried [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2534.32s)]
*  to get me deplatformed for being pro-Palestinian. Okay. Consistently claiming that I am creating an [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2540.16s)]
*  environment for anti-Semitism. One of the most vicious smears coming from a person that I knew [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2547.52s)]
*  personally, just remember that. Okay. Like he doesn't know anything. Stop. He didn't apologize. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2553.3599999999997s)]
*  Zani doubled down. I thought he did. I thought he was like, yeah, we didn't know. I thought he said [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2561.2s)]
*  his wife didn't know enough, which you know, you can be like, what the fuck do you mean? It's [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2565.6s)]
*  been a year, but I thought it was more so. I just don't want to even bring up Ethan man is a [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2570.0s)]
*  fucking distraction is so dumb. Shut up. Oh God. It's even a, it's an even bigger distraction and [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2574.8s)]
*  stupid thing to talk about in this moment. Please let's move on and let's eyes on the prize lock in [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2582.72s)]
*  to bring about a ceasefire in Gaza, potentially hard. I mean, they're difficult enough as it is [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2589.44s)]
*  at the moment. Um, in terms of the timing of this, I think there probably are two factors. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2594.08s)]
*  One is what is going on in Northern Gaza at the moment. Israel is being accused of carrying out [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2600.56s)]
*  anything between ethnic cleansing and genocide. I should point out the accusation of genocide is [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2607.28s)]
*  an accusation. Uh, it is not, uh, being formally labeled as such. That is a matter for another [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2612.4s)]
*  court. The ICJ is international court of justice. Um, but those are the accusations that are being [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2618.8s)]
*  labeled at the Israeli government and the Israeli military for their actions in Northern Gaza right [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2625.2000000000003s)]
*  now. And secondly, I do think that Trump, that incoming Trump administration might have played [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2629.6800000000003s)]
*  a factor into the timing for the release of this announcement, uh, as well. Uh, so it will probably [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2635.6800000000003s)]
*  complicate matters when it comes to, um, trying to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza. Um, we will have to [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2642.96s)]
*  see how Benjamin Netanyahu reacts. I can't think that he will leave it long before releasing some [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2650.2400000000002s)]
*  form of statement or something will come out from the prime minister's office. Uh, but in the past, [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2654.96s)]
*  he has been, um, very defiant about his own actions. And a lot of Israelis, I would say, [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2661.6800000000003s)]
*  were appalled at the idea, even if they don't like or support Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2671.04s)]
*  they were pulled at the idea that Israel's leaders could be on the same. Oh dude. Yeah, [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2676.24s)]
*  that's how you know motherfuckers are not with it. Okay. Imagine the celebrations in this community. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2682.8799999999997s)]
*  If the ICC put forth an arrest warrant application for Joseph Robinette Brandon, [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2690.7999999999997s)]
*  I would, which by the way would be perfectly valid. Just so you understand, [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2698.24s)]
*  they would never do that because that's like a bridge too far, obviously. But like, that's the [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2703.2799999999997s)]
*  difference. That's the difference between people who are with it. Okay. And people who are phony. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2707.8399999999997s)]
*  Yair Lapid, you're fucking phony. Okay. Stop hitting the weights, bitch. I get it. You got a [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2714.0s)]
*  great fucking hairline for your goddamn age. What happened to being a part of the fuck Benjamin [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2720.3999999999996s)]
*  Netanyahu coalition? Huh? You bitch. You centrist bitch. Imagine, imagine the tears of joy that we [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2725.84s)]
*  would cry if, if George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, fuck it, Barack Obama, Donald Trump, Joe Biden [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2734.8s)]
*  would be brought forth in front of the ICC, Tony Blair. Oh, oh, that's the difference. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2743.6800000000003s)]
*  These guys, they just don't want it. They're not real with it. They're not about it. They're [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2752.8s)]
*  not about this lifestyle. They just aesthetically are like, Oh yeah, we hate Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2757.2000000000003s)]
*  Hillary Clinton. Oh my God. For the crimes in Libya. Oh my God. That's why I was excited [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2761.6800000000003s)]
*  for Donald Trump when he said, logger up. I thought to myself, one can only hope. Okay. Hillary Clinton [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2768.32s)]
*  go into jail for some other dumb shit. But in my mind, in my head, Canon, it would be for her crimes [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2774.96s)]
*  in Haiti and her crimes in Libya. Oh, oh, fuck it. Throw bill in there too. God cheat. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2781.36s)]
*  Look, look, dude, brother. I guarantee the AOC would have you arrested for a committee appointment. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2789.6s)]
*  She literally said, Kamala was totally working. Yes. Yeah. Yes, dude. You're right. AOC is the [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2793.36s)]
*  biggest enemy of the left. You got it. It's certainly not the hyper fixation of every fucking [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2798.4s)]
*  permanently online left is like criticizing AOC for silly shit that she says like this. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=2803.84s)]

*  for members of different communities in this country. We have to remember who we are, [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=3056.96s)]

*  amputations performed. Yeah, remember, it's important to also remember why Benjamin and Yahoo [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=3146.0s)]
*  is considered a war criminal now. And so is Yoav Galant. And so as many members of the Israeli [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=3152.3999999999996s)]

*  reason. It's not for no reason. And it's certainly not because of anti-Semitism. Okay. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=3169.92s)]
*  Israel's war in Gaza has been filled with horrors that are hard to fathom. Israel accused of [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=3176.88s)]
*  deliberately blocking aid, even as a humanitarian crisis deepens. Today, it led to arrest warrants [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=3183.04s)]
*  for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as well as former Defense Minister Yoav Galant [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=3190.88s)]

*  The court also issued a warrant for Hamas' military commander, [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=3220.96s)]
*  Mohammed Daif, though he is believed to be dead, accusing him of crimes against humanity [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=3224.72s)]

*  It's the arrest warrants for Israeli politicians that are unprecedented, [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=3275.52s)]
*  Netanyahu becoming the first leader of a western-style democracy to be accused by the court. Here he was [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=3292.4s)]

*  Today, he dismissed the charges as absurd, biased and anti-Semitic. But public statements [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=3366.8799999999997s)]
*  made by the men themselves form part of the evidence against them. At the start of the war, [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=3373.9199999999996s)]
*  Gallant said food, water and fuel would all be blocked from entering Gaza. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=3380.24s)]
*  Has the ADL called the ICC anti-Semitic yet? The apartheid defense league? I'm [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=3385.52s)]
*  certain that they have already. This is their opportunity to shine, you know? [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=3390.24s)]
*  In the face of international pressure, aid has been allowed in, but nowhere near enough. Today [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=3397.84s)]
*  in Gaza, displaced Palestinians welcomed the charges, though many fear they'll have little [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=3403.68s)]

*  Will Netanyahu and Gallant ever face the judges at the ICC? Everyone knows it's unlikely. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=3421.4399999999996s)]
*  The court has no police force to arrest anyone, but trips like this to London before the war [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=3428.9599999999996s)]
*  will now be much more difficult. Many of Israel's allies are members of the ICC [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=3435.52s)]
*  and are now obliged to detain the men if they enter the country, though America is not and [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0B10vJlCw&t=3442.32s)]
