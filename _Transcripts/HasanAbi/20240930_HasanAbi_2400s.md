# Hasan Discusses His Career And Personal Life With Taren David
**HasanAbi:** [September 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM)
*  Like I do collaborations, I play video games, I cover culture, lifestyle, things of that nature [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=0.0s)]
*  because I want to ensure that like people don't have this like set image of me as this person [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  with these ideals that can be very easily I think been used against you and you can be presented [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  with you can be presented in a way to an audience that is uninitiated. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=21.12s)]
*  Also I don't know how I once I realized it was a Philip Morris on brand I was like yeah [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=30.96s)]
*  maybe not the best idea. So are they basically like stole for the 21st century? Do you have to spit? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=36.56s)]
*  No no not at all so it's like it's it's not like chewing tobacco or anything it's just it's basically [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=43.36s)]
*  just pure nicotine. I grew up in the south so. Oh no I used to I used to chew and [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=50.08s)]
*  smoke so nicotine gum helped me no longer be addicted yeah I don't I don't I haven't smoked in years. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=60.08s)]
*  We're going to need you to be the voice of the left in media for many years so you should. Yeah [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=69.52s)]
*  if I make it that far we'll see. Oh man. You don't have to shoot me at all. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  So I thought that the focus of today's topics were going to be about mostly like masculinity [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=85.68s)]
*  and the presentation of masculinity. I don't mind if we go completely outside of that I have no [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=94.4s)]
*  issues with that. I also have no issues with like freestyling in general. I mean that's what I do [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=99.28s)]
*  best that's the only thing I do usually so this is like the way I see it it's no different than any [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=104.72s)]
*  other live stream that I would do. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=109.6s)]
*  I think like three buckets we'll kind of touch on and one will sort of be a little about your career [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=111.67999999999999s)]
*  and what you do and on Twitch because I know a lot of students are interested in that right and it's [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=118.32s)]
*  not something they learn much about at university because as I was telling David most of my [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=124.16s)]
*  colleagues didn't even know what Twitch was right so it's not like they're getting taught much here [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=129.76s)]
*  except in the comm school so we'll do that a little bit and I would like to talk about politics [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=134.64s)]
*  some because you're good at that and U.S.C. had a really fractious tense encampment breakdown last [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=139.67999999999998s)]
*  year and the students retreated very badly this summer right that were arrested by the university [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=151.51999999999998s)]
*  and all these fences you see those were not here. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=158.95999999999998s)]
*  Yeah I noticed that even like entering like I've been to U.S.C. campus before I never had to like [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=162.0s)]
*  go through you know like the ID checking process before. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=170.16s)]
*  So I think you know we should dive into things you've been talking about for a long time. I've [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=174.96s)]
*  talked to several students in the last few weeks who young women who found your stream because of [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=180.96s)]
*  your gossip content over the last year right who didn't know you before right but were told by [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=189.6s)]
*  people that you were someone they could learn about the history of the region from so some of [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=196.32s)]
*  them will be here right so. Hell yeah. And I am part of the Palestine Justice Faculty Group I've [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=202.4s)]
*  been BDS for 12 years 14 years right so this is an opportunity for us to have a little bit of [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=210.56s)]
*  conversation about Palestine that doesn't happen. Yeah. If you're comfortable. No I'm totally [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=220.56s)]
*  comfortable about that no I was just trying to see what like I just don't want to. Masculinity. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=225.44s)]
*  Yeah I just the only reason I asked is so because I didn't want to you know I didn't want to ruffle [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=231.28s)]
*  any feathers or anything like that if the conversation is supposed to be focused on [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=236.56s)]
*  masculinity I'm fine with doing that but I'm more than comfortable. That's what our project studies [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=239.92s)]
*  I study hate online. Yeah. I've talked to many many young men one who will be here to meet you [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=246.79999999999998s)]

*  you right like that's not. It's amazing. Just one person you know it's like just an art-time sample [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=259.59999999999997s)]
*  yeah so you offer like this really fantastic model of masculinity that is like growing. Hi [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=266.23999999999995s)]
*  nice to meet you. This is our media producer extraordinaire who is a journalist who worked [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=275.91999999999996s)]
*  for vice and cnn and works with cbs. Hélia there's a camera there we're live streaming it already [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=282.32s)]
*  just so you know okay just let you know so you don't feel sight yeah blindsided. What's up guys? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=291.76s)]
*  Yeah for sure. Oh is this for like the usc. Yes. Okay student journalists let's do it. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=302.15999999999997s)]
*  Should you want me to stand. It's okay. Whatever you want to do. Sorry. All right. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=307.84s)]
*  Marge is going to get on my camera. All right. Hello so the songbiker what does the songbiker mean [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=313.28s)]
*  to you? Hassan piker what does it mean to me? God just a guy trying to live every day one step at [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=321.2s)]
*  a time do the right thing. Fire. We also want to ask what's a masculine object? A masculine object [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=330.08s)]
*  damn immediately my mind went Freud like immediately I was thinking like what's the [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=337.28s)]
*  most phallic figure that I can think of cigar eggplant things like that but I think you know [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=342.24s)]
*  what a masculine object is the the weight belt that I use when I'm deadlifting because it braces [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=351.36s)]
*  my core it's protective but it's necessary that's a masculine object for me. That's a good answer. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=357.68s)]
*  Do you have any other questions guys? Maybe last question how do you define masculinity? Oh how do [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=365.6s)]
*  you define masculinity? Oh this is a tough one. How do I define masculinity? It's just I think a [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=369.52s)]
*  lot of people consider traits such as confidence like they mistake confidence for masculinity and [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=376.64s)]
*  that's pretty much it. I don't really put a lot of thought into it ironically enough even though [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=383.28s)]
*  today's talks are going to be about masculinity but for me I think it's it's basically being the [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=389.28s)]
*  best version of yourself and and being a confident human being. Fire okay thanks everybody. We good? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=397.2s)]
*  Yeah. All right awesome. But it's not nice to meet you it's not necessarily just a masculine trait [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=403.84s)]
*  though which I guess we'll talk about today. Yeah we will. Oh oh you wanted to keep going. Dane um [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=408.24s)]
*  and Sophie and Danny and Yana all are part of reclaim which is our project that's getting [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=414.15999999999997s)]
*  thinking about new models for masculinity so that's how you know you're my syllabus tomorrow. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=420.96s)]
*  Oh wow okay like I'm being taught in college courses that's crazy. You are being taught in college courses. That's crazy. In my men and masculinity. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=427.03999999999996s)]
*  All right let me ask you what do you think masculinity is? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=434.64s)]
*  Yeah go ahead. I don't know. In front of your teacher too you're cooked. You're about to get graded on this. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=441.2s)]
*  Dane knows that I love him so it's fine. I guess I've had to ask that question to so many people [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=447.52s)]
*  that like I just feel like anything that I thought was like an objective definition has just sort of [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=452.0s)]
*  gone away because I feel like I get like every answer to the point where like masculinity is just [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=456.16s)]
*  like anything and like some people say like oh masculinity is like being strong being like [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=459.68s)]
*  being a manly man protecting your family and some people are just like oh masculinity is like [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=464.40000000000003s)]
*  being a good person so I just feel like it's like almost meaningless at this point because like [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=468.64000000000004s)]
*  that's how I feel about it. Yeah it's just like a universal it's just like whatever is good is masculine. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=472.48s)]
*  I think that's why I focus more on like the the misappropriation of the term masculinity [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=476.88s)]
*  like or the way that people call themselves like alpha alpha men it's usually just a it's usually [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=484.4s)]
*  just a catch-all term but what they technically mean is like being confident and it's ironic [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=490.79999999999995s)]
*  because like people that are like people that consider themselves as are anything but confident [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=496.71999999999997s)]
*  and I think that most of the time they try to to masquerade as this like macho figure what they think [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=502.88s)]
*  is like supposed to be this masculine beacon and they're usually for their own personal [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=513.4399999999999s)]
*  insecurities in my experience that's what I found and I definitely understand that too given you [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=518.96s)]
*  know I mean I was a young boy at one point in my life as well I'm 33 I'm old now but you know I [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=525.12s)]
*  definitely found myself in the throes of like portraying myself as like what I thought were [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=532.4s)]
*  masculine figures in media and like resembling those traits that I thought were cool [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=539.6s)]
*  and thinking that they were masculine so I definitely understand how people can be [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=544.48s)]
*  susceptible to that especially young men yeah awesome I wanted to ask like what do you think [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=547.68s)]
*  young boys like young men who are on the internet like what should they do or what should they know [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=553.4399999999999s)]
*  about like as they learn about themselves and masculinity and like as they go through those [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=557.84s)]
*  teenage years um don't trust anybody that presents themselves as like a as a if you're 14 [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=561.44s)]
*  and you think wow this guy has cool cars he's always surrounded by scantily clad women he is [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=570.96s)]
*  such a he's so alpha I want to be just like him know that that's a trap if a whole ass adult is [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=577.12s)]
*  portraying himself that way then they're for severe and that they're trying to project an image of [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=583.6800000000001s)]
*  what you consider to be success and you shouldn't be due by that you should be your own person [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=589.52s)]
*  instead what are the demographics of your audience right now and how do you view kind of your role [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=594.16s)]
*  as this messenger is this person to them um we do a census every year I don't know what the exact [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=600.16s)]
*  numbers are I keep forgetting but I think it's it's mostly it's predominantly white men uh that are [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=607.28s)]
*  uh 30 like around 30 30 plus or you know 20 to 35 let's say and yeah him [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=614.88s)]
*  exactly um but uh we have I think what chat what's the percentage of women in my community [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=626.24s)]
*  it depends on the platform it's 67 percent men 24 percent women eight percent non-binary [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=633.8399999999999s)]
*  and also primarily like yeah 25 to 36 yeah 25 to 35 is like the the most the the largest demo [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=639.44s)]
*  which is interesting because like my demographics have aged as I have aged because like I looked at [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=646.08s)]
*  it like we've been running the census every year since 2020 consistently and over the four years [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=651.7600000000001s)]
*  like the demographic has also just aged four years into like different brackets Israel has a but um [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=657.2s)]
*  yeah that's the that's the dynamic it's like quarter women eight percent non-binary and then [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=664.4000000000001s)]
*  the rest is men I bet there are more women on insta checking out your outfit every day I think [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=669.36s)]
*  there were in the past it's actually interesting before I got on twitch I was I still had like [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=675.36s)]
*  somewhat of a social media presence when I was on the young turks and back then my audience was 75 [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=681.12s)]
*  percent women 25 percent men on instagram and when I got on twitch I can check it right now [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=685.9200000000001s)]
*  but when I got on twitch it went to 50 50 so I don't even know it might even be like majority [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=691.92s)]
*  men now but we'll see let's take a look how do I even find 50 50 on insta I think it might be [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=698.0799999999999s)]
*  David would know better let's see insights [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=704.4799999999999s)]
*  how do I find that overview in the last seven days I don't really post that much either anymore [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=712.3199999999999s)]

*  okay let's do um and as are you um set up for the questions [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=761.76s)]
*  like an iPad or something I was doing oh it's literally 50 50 it's 51.5 men 48.4 percent women [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=772.24s)]
*  damn you nailed it that's your job right yeah youtube's a little different too but [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=781.52s)]
*  twitch is the male dominated one yeah youtube's a little bit more in the middle I think it's very [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=787.6800000000001s)]
*  platform centered for sure like twitch is a overwhelmingly male dominated platform [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=794.16s)]
*  because yeah twitch hurts my brain yeah I get that a lot but like actually I have a I have a [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=802.4s)]
*  relatively young audience on youtube as well because youtube's audience skews younger so it [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=808.48s)]
*  balances itself out I I remember talking to youtube a while ago where they were like [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=812.72s)]
*  they were telling me that I have the the youngest demographic overall of any kind of political [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=818.96s)]
*  content on the entire platform yeah like the piece you put together really quickly after the [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=824.24s)]
*  new york times dropped the story about young men and women drifting farther apart politically [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=829.6s)]
*  you know when you package that on youtube that's a really tight great episode that yeah there's [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=836.4s)]
*  some explanation for that well the manosphere the way I work is I try to make it so that [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=842.48s)]
*  my commentary already is like as as quickly packaged as possible as like neatly [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=850.08s)]
*  uh you know I try to cover stories with that in mind who I mean do you have like a small team [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=857.6s)]
*  that just cuts the stream down yeah to the youtube kind of trunk every night yeah it's like a speedy [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=864.64s)]
*  operation yeah and it's like pretty like I said it's just uh I try to I try to make it as like [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=871.52s)]
*  uh as as fast paced as possible so it's like already packaged with like as as limited amount [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=878.56s)]
*  of editing as possible and the only thing I ask of my editors usually is to just like add [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=884.48s)]
*  because I pull data a lot from my head and it's good that they will go and find the data and just [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=891.28s)]
*  like slap it on there um so that there is like you know so that it's sourced adequately how much time [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=898.0s)]
*  do you have to spend how do you even find I'll probably ask you this outside too but how do you [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=904.96s)]
*  even find time to read as much as you must have to I just I don't know that's everything I do is [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=910.4s)]
*  like everything I do basically every moment of my life is geared towards it so that's how I that's [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=916.72s)]
*  how I'm able to keep up with it like I'm I'm like a like an information sponge you couldn't actually [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=924.0s)]
*  be a professor because we have no work-life balance either we're just not interesting right so you know [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=929.68s)]
*  like everything's thinking about your work all the time right that's that's what we do yeah [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=936.24s)]
*  but we have fantastic students well now that you're now that you're not on twitter as much I think [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=944.8s)]
*  it's been easier back in the twitter hey days I feel like it was non-stop what do you mean like [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=949.36s)]
*  we'd go to dinner or something or you'd be at dinner with people oh yeah you'd have to like be [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=956.72s)]
*  checking twitter yeah I used to breaking and everything yeah I definitely feel like I mean [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=960.56s)]
*  I've done a decent job of like keeping up with stuff even outside of twitter now because I deleted [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=966.16s)]
*  it from my phone but like twitter definitely was a really solid way for me to keep up with everything [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=970.88s)]
*  that's going on um back in the day but I've I've just stopped going on twitter uh unless I'm on [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=976.3199999999999s)]
*  stream like my husband had already bought a tesla that I have to drive right now because I gave my [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=983.3599999999999s)]
*  son my old car and we had to put a bumper sticker on it that said we bought this before we knew [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=989.52s)]
*  what a dickhead he was right that's amazing because I could stand like comfortably right around in the tesla [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=996.72s)]
*  yeah speaking of toxic oh yeah and I can't afford a Porsche oh yeah there's a lot of great evs now [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1007.6s)]
*  and that are affordable and reliable luckily the keys are pretty solid [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1019.8399999999999s)]
*  I'm just gonna also explain to marsh he should feel free to keep the stream camera just on his [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1036.8s)]
*  yeah I was [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1042.0s)]
*  yeah I'm sorry I'm not [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1044.48s)]
*  I tried to you know but sometimes it's okay I mean I'm not [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1053.68s)]
*  I have a nephew who I'm going to gain so much credibility with for like having met the song [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1058.96s)]
*  hell yeah and my son will be in the front row because he's also like a huge fan I do get that [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1065.76s)]
*  yeah for sure um that's great you're you're w auntie you're w aunt the other one of the [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1072.88s)]
*  young men you'll meet tonight we're doing a short doc with and he spoke in the doc very eloquently [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1083.52s)]
*  about your influence on him that's nice he's very excited that's sick yeah I was gonna say [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1092.24s)]
*  too I was just initially to report on the election and I went to a trump town hall and about like [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1101.92s)]
*  thinking I'm interested to hear I guess how you people are being able to do radicalized [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1108.64s)]
*  and these people especially from places like mission or economy economy and I feel like we [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1116.24s)]
*  all know the election is such big stakes so much more than that yeah but I also don't necessarily [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1122.56s)]
*  think that like trump is good on the economy that's the other aspect of this like I mean I'm not [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1128.3999999999999s)]
*  exactly too fond of the democratic party either but uh in terms of like de-radicalizing these people [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1133.6s)]
*  I think that um I think that overall the number one thing is is that there needs to be like a [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1140.56s)]
*  level of charitability so if they approach the conversation with like inherent hostility [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1147.9199999999998s)]
*  it's going to be pretty difficult like people make up their minds about you they put you in [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1154.56s)]
*  a neat little confine neat little box and they go oh no this is a this is a liberal like this is uh [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1159.36s)]
*  this person has these opinions right so I try to I try to broaden the kinds of content that I make [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1165.6s)]
*  for that reason like I do collaborations I play video games I cover culture lifestyle things of [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1173.4399999999998s)]
*  that nature because I I want to ensure that like uh people don't have this like set image of me as [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1178.8799999999999s)]
*  this person with these ideals that can be very easily I think and used against you and and you [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1186.8799999999999s)]
*  can be presented with uh you can be presented in a way to an audience that is uninitiated uh in a [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1194.32s)]
*  way that like uh does not correspond to your worldview at all so I think that's important [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1201.2s)]
*  and I and when I'm around people with different opinions and I am around people with different [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1206.0s)]
*  perspectives all the time regardless of the eight hours that I'm you know spending online I also [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1211.84s)]
*  try to spend as much time possible as possible in the real world um you know I try to I try to [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1217.2s)]
*  approach them where they're at I try to understand where they're coming from and communicate to their [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1225.2800000000002s)]
*  desires which is ironic because like that's kind of what I want the Democratic party to do as well [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1231.1200000000001s)]
*  as a as a more successful counterbalance against growing that I see within the Republican party [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1236.48s)]
*  and uh you know they fail to do that on every front unfortunately but it is what it is [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1242.88s)]
*  yeah it's very disappointing [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1250.16s)]
*  gaming spaces are gaming spaces are I think too focused on on on women being in video games right [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1261.68s)]
*  now to focus on anything else they probably don't even know that their election is coming up [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1269.04s)]
*  they're just they're too predisposed with woke ruining video games which is a direct rehash of [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1274.32s)]
*  like the gamer gate stuff that used to happen way back in the day DEI critical race theory yeah [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1283.36s)]
*  pronouns DEI woke that kind of stuff [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1291.92s)]
*  chat stop asking March to do emotes that I will not be saying [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1296.1599999999999s)]

*  country as soon as you're writing articles about it there's a I think there was someone who did a [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1860.8799999999999s)]
*  dissertation on like politics and streaming there has been a couple at this point which is [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1869.12s)]
*  the students I work with who's a PhD student at Simon Fraser in Vancouver wrote a lot about the [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1875.52s)]
*  far-right manuscript but he also writes about the counter and so he he writes some about you too so [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1882.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean it's quite a bit popping up out there now yeah I um it's been interesting just to see [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1888.88s)]
*  how students who are college age right now who are probably a little bit below your core demo [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1898.5600000000002s)]
*  respond to what you're doing I think you're like able to speak to young men who are maybe 13 or 14 [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1904.96s)]
*  in a way because you kind of could communicate a browness that like some left political streamers [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1913.04s)]
*  can't so yeah not if you feel like a role model of some kind right yeah I mean it's it's just [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1919.92s)]
*  who I am organically I think that's what it is it's not like I'm not putting on a front right [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1929.12s)]
*  and I think that it just kind of happened to work that way like these are my genuine opinions and [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1936.08s)]
*  this is who I am uh I mean you seem genuinely kind which you know like I keep waiting for it [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1942.32s)]
*  to be revealed to not be true maybe because you know I study celebrity and there's usually a [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1949.9199999999998s)]
*  pretty big gap between a persona and a real life person right but I was so impressed with your [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1955.9199999999998s)]
*  mannerisms when they were kicking you out of the DNC you were like incredibly um [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1965.6799999999998s)]
*  gracious right well I mean I was your mother raised you well well for sure I think she definitely [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1971.84s)]
*  did but also I think that uh it was because I was like I was already excited at the opportunity [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1978.0s)]
*  like I don't take it for granted you know what I mean I I think like I don't have a a sense of [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1985.04s)]
*  entitlement about it where like I I know what I present and I know what like value I bring but [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1990.32s)]
*  so I know you know I know the value that I present but I that doesn't mean that like I'm expecting [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=1998.32s)]
*  other people to be aware of it so I I basically took every moment that they gave me at the DNC [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2004.8799999999999s)]
*  as like a benefit as a positive you know I we had already we were what are you playing right now [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2012.32s)]
*  we were already setting up as like uh we I basically had to set up at the hotel room [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2018.8799999999999s)]
*  knowing full well that like I was not even going to have a space to stream out of inside of the DNC [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2027.28s)]
*  so I was super stoked at the opportunity to begin with so I even when that was taken away it didn't [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2032.72s)]
*  change that dynamic for me at all it was I was still like very excited and you were so I mean [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2039.44s)]
*  you were really gracious right there was no diva there no no it was very impressive yeah I mean [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2044.64s)]
*  it's you know I'm I'm lugging I'm lugging my remote setup around myself so it's not like [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2050.56s)]
*  we need like a lot of because I'm in a civil school I need a lot of folks right and um [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2057.44s)]
*  a lot of them are people you're going to want to hang out with right yeah a lot of like entitlement [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2065.44s)]
*  but I think as far as like me not being different um from the way I present myself on camera is [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2072.24s)]
*  that like with twitch streaming in particular it's virtually impossible to present a false [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2078.0s)]
*  front because you're literally live for eight to ten hours a day and you know I think it's true [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2082.9599999999996s)]
*  with a lot of other streamers or I think like uh if you're not limiting if you're not limiting [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2091.04s)]
*  your interactions if you're not like maybe it might be a little different if you're like [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2098.24s)]
*  playing a video game or something but like the way I uh you know I talk about real news and [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2102.16s)]
*  world events and also beyond that I'm constantly engaging with people in the chat like I don't [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2109.9199999999996s)]
*  think I'd be able to present myself as like a different person than who I am I don't think [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2116.24s)]
*  anyone is that good like at acting in general but but yeah there is definitely a level of like [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2120.9599999999996s)]
*  authenticity that the platform automatically provides by the very nature of the medium [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2127.68s)]
*  twitch you think in particular yeah just like live streaming in particular for sure I mean I [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2133.2s)]
*  spend a lot of time looking at the far right men in the far right online because that's how the [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2137.52s)]
*  lab work I'm doing with students now where that came out of right and they feel completely [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2147.2s)]
*  artificial to me like there's even the intertates and even Jordan but entertain doesn't do like [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2153.12s)]
*  eight hours of live streaming he's very limited in his like the way that he presents himself to [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2159.92s)]
*  the outside world is like very manicured yeah there is no like he will do a guest slot every [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2166.4s)]
*  now and then on someone else's live stream or I think he has his own live streams as well but [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2173.52s)]
*  those are like an hour long they're they're responding to questions that they're fielding [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2178.16s)]
*  from their audience and I think you have the capacity to present yourself a certain way [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2183.92s)]
*  and and you know leave a lot of leave a lot of the other aspects of your life [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2189.44s)]
*  a secret if you choose to do so I've thought about this a lot like I because I used to always [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2195.7599999999998s)]
*  wonder like why is it that why is it that like certain youtubers even for example get like [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2203.76s)]
*  a lot of praise whereas even if they haven't really done much in any direction in terms of [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2212.48s)]
*  political activism but like people are hyper critical of everything I do and it was definitely [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2218.1600000000003s)]
*  it sounds really like envious but in some ways it was and and I think it's because like if you are [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2224.88s)]
*  not exposing yourself in in all of your you know even your worst moments emotional moments angry [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2232.64s)]
*  moments depressed moments every single day for eight to ten hours like you can you can create [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2241.2s)]
*  the best version of yourself for your audience even in avenues where or even in mediums like [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2249.92s)]
*  youtube that are significantly more personable than celebrities I think celebrities like real [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2255.6s)]
*  celebrities not influencers I think they are that's like the final stage of that right like [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2262.08s)]
*  people they drip feed especially with like k-pop idols like they drip feed personal [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2271.04s)]
*  like they drip feed their personalities but I think every single thing is like calculated [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2279.92s)]
*  specifically to invoke this like parasocial dynamic and they are able to present themselves [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2286.4s)]
*  as deities almost because every step that they take is completely manicured and if something is [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2292.64s)]
*  out of step or out of line with like the persona or the character that they've cultivated they have [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2299.36s)]
*  you know millions of dollars of pr working against that whether it be to like silence [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2306.0s)]
*  you know negative articles or whether it be to flood the market with positive pr immediately [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2312.88s)]
*  after something comes out about them whereas I don't think twitch streamers have that or [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2317.6800000000003s)]
*  youtubers have that but push streamers definitely are in the lowest rung of entertainment in that [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2323.44s)]
*  in that capacity where you're just you can't not be yourself I mean one of the things I'll [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2330.2400000000002s)]
*  probably want to talk to you about a mistake just a little bit is something I heard you say [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2336.2400000000002s)]
*  about how you consider yourself to be in a kind of reverse parasocial relationship [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2341.76s)]
*  and I found that super intriguing so I'll probably ask you about that yeah I can talk about that [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2348.0s)]
*  that actually explained in some ways things that feel a little bit different about you maybe [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2355.04s)]
*  because of your ubiquity because you're so much online than some of the other streaming personalities [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2360.5600000000004s)]
*  you know I've um it's been some time looking at it yeah so um you would be alone for a little [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2367.2799999999997s)]
*  few minutes before so I gotta pee real quick [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2376.88s)]
*  you know I'm taking this off dude come on we've made this [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2388.0s)]
*  them then yeah you can take them like take them to the yeah you can take them and get ready [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2391.2s)]
*  and then they can also prep at the top of the hour for a three minute ad break [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AQ9Pg9yVQM&t=2396.96s)]
