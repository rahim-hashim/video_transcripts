# Teamsters Explain Why NEITHER Trump Or Harris Got An Endorsement | Hasanabi React
**HasanAbi:** [September 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg)
*  Like this, him using this, him using this is ridiculous. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=0.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=4.7s)]
*  Him saying the rail, like our brothers and sisters, the railroad union is ridiculous [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=5.64s)]
*  because those unions endorsed the democratic party and those unions were happy with the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=9.96s)]
*  concessions of the democratic party pushed for the after, after forcing them back to [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=14.32s)]
*  work. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=19.8s)]
*  Axios reporting or the New York times reporting New York times reported in Harris [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=25.76s)]
*  meeting with them Monday, she told the union, I want your endorsement, but if I don't get [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=29.52s)]
*  it, I will treat you exactly if I had gotten your endorsement. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=32.76s)]
*  That's what Kamala Harris said after the meeting. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=36.08s)]
*  Mr. O'Brien said that he still needed time to consider the union's next move. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=38.08s)]
*  Miss Harris opened the meeting by saying she understood she might not get the union's [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=41.0s)]
*  endorsement and that some teamsters will be voting on issues beyond labor, such as the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=43.72s)]
*  border, according to another person in the room. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=47.72s)]
*  I think one of the worst aspects of the team is just like, you know, which has again, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=50.16s)]
*  1.3 million members is that I fear that there is not a lot of education occurring inside of the union [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=54.64s)]
*  beyond, you know, just here Trump. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=64.56s)]
*  Let's hear what Sean O'Brien is looking forward to this interview sometime, especially given the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=67.52s)]
*  last minute drama. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=70.84s)]
*  I'm talking about a chat with Sean O'Brien. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=72.08s)]
*  He is the teamsters general president. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=74.32s)]
*  We've talked to him many times. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=76.28s)]
*  I think no matter what he says, he'll couch it under like doing right by his rank and [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=77.76s)]
*  filers. But I genuinely think it's like culture wars. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=82.4s)]
*  Maybe I'm wrong. OK, maybe I'm wrong, but I think it is 100% culture wars. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=85.72s)]
*  I think he's just like a little bit of a weirdo on this front. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=91.76s)]
*  Republicans are making inroads on what? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  Labor issues? What? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=98.2s)]
*  No, they're not. Dude, shut the fuck up. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=100.28s)]
*  Hey, guys, stop. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=102.48s)]
*  OK, wake the fuck up. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=104.36000000000001s)]
*  Republicans are not making any inroads on labor issues. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=106.44s)]
*  The Democratic Party barely makes any inroads on labor issues. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=110.04s)]
*  If you ever think that the Republican Party is actually going to make any concessions [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=113.64s)]
*  to labor unions. Oh, you mean Long Island? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  Oh, OK. I thought when you said Eli, you meant I'm sorry. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  I thought you meant labor issues. I apologize. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=123.64s)]
*  Anyway, like teamsters, like other other states, other states and their own teamsters, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=126.28s)]
*  unions are endorsing the endorsing the Democratic Party. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=134.88s)]
*  But like, God, I hate this conversation so much [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=138.88000000000002s)]
*  is it comes across like I'm defending the Democratic Party when I'm absolutely not. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=142.60000000000002s)]
*  But if you look at a duopoly as a labor union and you look at either party, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=146.76000000000002s)]
*  one party is actually offering limited amounts of concessions to the labor unions. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=152.72s)]
*  The other party is trying to gut it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=157.84s)]
*  OK, the other party is just desperately trying to gut it, openly gutting it, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=160.72000000000003s)]
*  laughing about the idea of striking, firing striking workers. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=164.84s)]
*  That's what Donald Trump did with Elon Musk. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=169.23999999999998s)]
*  These are two billionaires, dude. Get the out of here. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=170.92s)]
*  Like if it was about like a very obvious policy agenda, that's one thing. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=173.04s)]
*  If Sean O'Brien was coming out. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=179.12s)]
*  OK, if Sean O'Brien came out and was like, listen, I wanted assurances on Proact. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=181.79999999999998s)]
*  I wanted car check. You're wrong. Sean O'Brien asked Kamala. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=187.4s)]
*  OK, dude, Mark Wayne Mullin. OK, stop. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=191.07999999999998s)]
*  He's got a lot of ideas and he speaks his mind. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=194.68s)]
*  That's why I'm a little surprised by this news today [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=198.51999999999998s)]
*  that the teamsters will not be officially endorsing a presidential candidate. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=201.28s)]
*  So I thought to myself, Neil, when you talk to Sean, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=205.76s)]
*  asking how a guy who was invited to speak before Republicans at their convention, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=209.6s)]
*  but didn't get the same honor at the Democratic Convention, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=215.32s)]
*  could decide not to support the Republican. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=219.16s)]
*  Definitely should have welcomed him as a speaker at the God. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=222.6s)]
*  They should have definitely welcomed as a speaker, the DNC. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=227.96s)]
*  God, the DNC is so bad. The Democratic Party is so stupid. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=230.51999999999998s)]
*  That but that's like that's besides the point. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=235.28s)]
*  Still, again, like they are not they are not on the whims of like one man's personal, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=238.28s)]
*  personal animus or his own personal pet project or whatever the like. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=245.48s)]
*  That's ridiculous, too, because you need to do right by your rank and file members. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=249.84s)]
*  And I feel like this is I mean, this is just like stupid. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=254.92000000000002s)]
*  And here he is, Sean O'Brien. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  Good to have you, Sean. Why not? Why not? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=261.92s)]
*  Oh, I, sir. Well, listen, we interviewed both candidates [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=264.32s)]
*  and we were seeking commitments from both candidates and we couldn't get. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=268.32s)]
*  By the way, I forgot to run the three minute [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=272.64s)]
*  after saying I was going to run at the top of the hour. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=274.16s)]
*  So I'm running it now on commitments on our core issues. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=276.24s)]
*  Like the Pro Act, like video and national right to work, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=279.44s)]
*  like staying out of labor disputes and not trying to force any contracts on us. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=282.55999999999995s)]
*  Like what happened to our brothers and sisters in the rail industry. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=287.03999999999996s)]
*  We didn't get solid commitments from either candidate, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=289.91999999999996s)]
*  which was a major factor in our decision. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=292.47999999999996s)]
*  Like this, him using this, him using this is ridiculous. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=294.96s)]
*  OK, him saying the rail, like our brothers and sisters, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=299.44s)]
*  the railroad union is ridiculous because those unions endorsed the Democratic Party [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=302.88s)]
*  and those unions were happy with the concessions of the Democratic Party pushed [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=307.28s)]
*  for the after after forcing them back to work. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=310.88s)]
*  So like that, like he knows that, bro, you're a labor leader. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=315.15999999999997s)]
*  Like you are literally you are you are straight up a the labor union leader. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=318.96s)]
*  You know exactly what happened. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=326.52s)]
*  You know what the attitude looks like amongst the railroad unions. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=329.52s)]
*  So you're wrong. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=335.0s)]
*  Everybody always tells me I'm wrong on this. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=336.28000000000003s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=338.16s)]
*  Everybody always tells me I'm wrong. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=339.08000000000004s)]
*  And then they never tell me how I'm wrong. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=340.84000000000003s)]
*  OK, we have the same exact conversation every goddamn time. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=343.48s)]
*  Every goddamn time decision as a general executive board not to endorse any candidate. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=348.04s)]
*  However, we did a lot of polling, as you know, and the polling leaned heavily [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=353.28000000000003s)]
*  towards former President Trump. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=357.32000000000005s)]
*  So that's very, very heavily, very heavily. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=360.16s)]
*  And I'm just wondering, do you look disconnected from your members? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=362.48s)]
*  No, we're definitely not disconnected from our members because look, we did extensive [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=366.64s)]
*  polling that was important. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=370.71999999999997s)]
*  Our goal is leaders as union leaders, as leader of the team. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=373.28s)]
*  Harris is going to break future strikes. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=376.44s)]
*  That's why she didn't get their endorsement. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=377.8s)]
*  Man, shut the fuck up. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=379.24s)]
*  Look, labor unions are not the same as like the average person that's going to go out and vote. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=380.52s)]
*  OK, the harm reduction conversation absolutely is a major player. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=388.6s)]
*  Sean O'Brien should extract concessions from the Democratic Party. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=393.84000000000003s)]
*  That is perfectly valid and the smart thing to do. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=397.72s)]
*  But the notion that like he is openly in the tank in the most in the most cowardly way [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=401.56s)]
*  possible for the Republican Party is unimaginably wrong. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=410.04s)]
*  OK, because like in this circumstance, in this circumstance, you're when he is leaning [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=415.68s)]
*  on one side and saying like, oh, well, our rank of filers love Donald Trump, they're big fans [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=421.96s)]
*  of Donald Trump. I couldn't be in at odds with our rank of filers. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=427.84s)]
*  OK, when he says that, it implies that Donald Trump wouldn't do that. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=433.04s)]
*  Is to provide the ability for people to have a voice and to provide credible information. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=437.08s)]
*  And we cannot dictate to our members. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=443.64s)]
*  Our members are sophisticated. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=445.79999999999995s)]
*  They're going to make their own decisions. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=447.08s)]
*  But this is a bigger problem. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=448.44s)]
*  You know, the Democrats have always taken for granted that they're going to Republicans fancy [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=449.84s)]
*  themselves as the working parties, working people's party. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=454.35999999999996s)]
*  I think right now both sides have to take a step back and really reevaluate what their [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=458.35999999999996s)]
*  commitment is to working people. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=463.79999999999995s)]
*  And that's what we did in this process. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=465.47999999999996s)]
*  All right. But it does make me wonder when two out of three of your members prefer Donald [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=467.59999999999997s)]
*  Trump, not to telephone survey, I grant that. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=472.76s)]
*  But that trend has been around for a while where members tend to favor more the Republican [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=474.84s)]
*  candidate, the Democratic candidate. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=480.4s)]
*  But that that that that's that's a pretty overwhelming shutout right there. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=481.76s)]
*  So I think we did that. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=486.28s)]
*  You're thinking or no, we evaluated everything. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=488.12s)]
*  We evaluate the straw poll, which was done in person, which, as you know, here, I'll give you [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=492.32s)]
*  some background from Jacobin on the straw poll. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=497.59999999999997s)]
*  OK. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=499.92s)]
*  The original straw poll was conducted from April 9th through July 3rd in union halls and [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=500.68s)]
*  was organized entirely by local union leadership. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=504.88s)]
*  From anecdotal evidence, it seems that only a small minority of locals took time to mobilize [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=507.96000000000004s)]
*  and educate their membership on these votes, the stakes of the election and the meaning of [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=512.2s)]
*  the polls. As a result, mainly active and engaged members who tend to lean Democrat showed [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=516.4s)]
*  up. This poll indicated that members backed then Democratic Party nominee Joe Biden 43 [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=521.28s)]
*  percent to Trump's 36 percent. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=527.6s)]
*  Immediately following this poll, the IBT leadership announced another poll, this one [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=530.4s)]
*  online that would supplement the in-person straw poll. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=534.96s)]
*  There was a lot of speculation that this online poll was commissioned to counteract the [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=538.5600000000001s)]
*  results of the straw poll. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=541.6800000000001s)]
*  There is no way of knowing whether that is true, but its results do indeed contradict [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=543.16s)]
*  the straw polls results. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=547.08s)]
*  This poll went heavily for Trump conducted between July 24th and September 15th. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=548.64s)]
*  Members voted 59.6 percent for Trump and only 34 percent for Democratic nominee Kamala [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=553.52s)]
*  Harris. This pattern itself, a wild swing from Biden to Trump, doesn't actually tell [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=559.76s)]
*  us very much. In fact, it confirms the suspicion held among many demographers and pollsters [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=565.52s)]
*  that engage in active members of organizations lean to the left. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=570.28s)]
*  Votes that take place in person self-select for the kind of people who have higher levels [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=573.48s)]
*  of institutional trust and a higher commitment to political action. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=577.36s)]
*  That is, they select for people who seem more like Kamala Harris voters. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=580.4399999999999s)]
*  The online vote does just the opposite. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=584.64s)]
*  So what about the phone research poll? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=587.48s)]
*  This poll had Harris losing as well by a wide margin with 58 percent for Trump and only [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=589.36s)]
*  31 percent for Harris. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=593.5600000000001s)]
*  Unlike the other two polls, this one was conducted on September 15th by a third party [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=595.36s)]
*  polling for so many union voters still vote for him. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=599.92s)]
*  The answer is threefold. First, inflation. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=603.08s)]
*  There's no getting around it. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=605.24s)]
*  Levels of inflation have been historic. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=606.24s)]
*  Whether they are the fault of the president and vice president is almost irrelevant. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=608.16s)]
*  Voters, especially working class voters, where neither party is like overtly defending [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=611.12s)]
*  their interests with the exception of this last candidacy, with the exception of this [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=617.52s)]
*  last president, I will stand on this. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=622.0799999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden's NLRB is one of the best national, one of the best NLRBs in recent history. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=626.48s)]
*  Joe Biden has been more progressive and more pro labor than any other contemporary U.S. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=635.12s)]
*  president. That is 100 percent correct. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=640.3199999999999s)]
*  The Democratic Party's messaging reflects this as well. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=643.76s)]
*  And yes, it is incredibly important to stand on the picket line. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=646.64s)]
*  It is incredibly important for the bully pulpit to be applied towards being pro labor and [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=651.24s)]
*  specifically being pro union. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=656.76s)]
*  This is absolutely correct. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=659.12s)]
*  OK, if you guys think that that is not the case, you are delusional. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=662.16s)]
*  OK, the bully pulpit is perhaps one of the most consequential aspects of the presidency. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=666.6s)]
*  Look at the way that the bully pulpit was applied when Donald Trump was president. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=671.76s)]
*  It was applied in a way to be as invidriolic and instill racial animus amongst the working [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=675.84s)]
*  class in the United States of America. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=682.8000000000001s)]
*  And the outcome was Nazis taking off the Klan's robes, taking off the masks and protesting [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=684.52s)]
*  in the streets with their faces open out in the open. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=689.8000000000001s)]
*  OK, they felt emboldened. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=693.28s)]
*  They felt galvanized. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=695.88s)]
*  Why? Because Donald Trump hyped them up. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=697.2s)]
*  OK, with what he said and what he refused to say. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=699.64s)]
*  The same goes in the other direction for labor unions with the American president. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=702.44s)]
*  OK, what do you mean when you say bully pulpit? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=707.48s)]
*  Thank you. Bully pulpit is just like what the president like the presidential platform. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=710.0s)]
*  If the president goes up there and on the most consequential platform is the leader [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=714.36s)]
*  of the free world, like unions are important or the backbone of this economy, that is [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=719.88s)]
*  incredibly important. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=724.36s)]
*  OK, that is very consequential. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=725.8000000000001s)]
*  The need for unity is incredibly important for a union. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=728.12s)]
*  And so it makes good sense to avoid topics that might cause division. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=730.4s)]
*  Still, the failure of union leadership to really articulate what working class interests [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=734.28s)]
*  are and how the parties help or harm those interests is a factor. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=737.5600000000001s)]
*  Such political education should be a monthly part of the union's activities and not [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=739.96s)]
*  relegated to a few short meetings in the year of a high stakes presidential election. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=743.36s)]
*  Finally, and most important, the Democratic Party has done a miserable job of trying to [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=747.4s)]
*  identify with the working class. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=750.28s)]
*  Many, if not most on the left, will offer an exasperated reply to this charge, insisting [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=751.52s)]
*  that Democrats are so much better for workers and unions. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=755.64s)]
*  Yes, that is obvious from a policy perspective, but leading liberals take for granted that [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=757.6s)]
*  workers are people too. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=762.44s)]
*  It's no secret that Democratic Party's image, interest and values system are far close to [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=764.0400000000001s)]
*  the upper middle class liberals than they are of the average working class. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=767.2s)]
*  Oh, I hate this article. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=770.72s)]
*  This article makes it seem like one of the law is I think teams might be the largest [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=772.5600000000001s)]
*  North American labor union, actually, if not one of the but I think it is the largest. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=777.08s)]
*  This article does the classic. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=782.76s)]
*  This article does the classic idiotic. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=785.88s)]
*  I can't believe I'm reading a chocolate article and I'm criticizing it this much. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=790.08s)]
*  I don't know who the pro does. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=794.08s)]
*  Dustin, go Estella. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=795.72s)]
*  I'm shocked. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=797.08s)]
*  Does the classic that runs with the assumption runs with the assumption that labor unions [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=798.4399999999999s)]
*  are not unimaginably diverse, OK, comprised of people from every different background. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=806.16s)]
*  I hate the idea that labor unions are comprised of people who are inherently reactionary and [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=813.68s)]
*  also all white. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=820.3199999999999s)]
*  That is so stupid. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=822.04s)]
*  That is just far from the truth in a country where the labor union participation rates for [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=823.7199999999999s)]
*  people is higher than labor union participation rates for white people. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=830.48s)]
*  OK, I just want to bring this up one more time. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=836.56s)]
*  This is a very important fact for people that don't know there are a higher rate of [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=840.36s)]
*  unionized black workers than there are a higher rate of unionized white workers. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=846.24s)]
*  OK, the notion that the Democratic Party on cultural issues are doing fancy, fancy footwork [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=853.76s)]
*  for like bi-coastal liberal elites is ridiculous when the Democratic Party talks. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=864.76s)]
*  They don't even do that anymore. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=872.6s)]
*  But when they used to talk about black issues or when they used to talk about trans issues, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=873.9200000000001s)]
*  when you talk about, you know, gay rights or whatever, the notion that this was liberal [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=878.8s)]
*  elites and not reflective of the no, not by pure numbers chatter, of course, per capita. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=884.16s)]
*  What are you saying? I said the labor participation rate. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=890.64s)]
*  What do you think that is? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=893.84s)]
*  The labor participation rate? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=895.28s)]
*  Yes, of course, not higher across the board. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=897.36s)]
*  There are 13 percent of the population is black. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=900.24s)]
*  Obviously, there aren't more black people in any field than there are white people. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=903.88s)]
*  There's just more white people in this country. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=909.5999999999999s)]
*  OK, anyway, just clarifying, but it's fine. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=911.4799999999999s)]
*  Let's get back to it. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=914.88s)]
*  OK, but once again, gay people, black people, queer people, lesbians, trans people, they [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=915.9599999999999s)]
*  are what makes the entire American labor force. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=923.4799999999999s)]
*  OK, that's it. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=927.4799999999999s)]
*  So just understand that. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=928.88s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=930.4799999999999s)]
*  The Maltese left is there's this article about the railway workers voting on the new [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=931.52s)]
*  contracts as given by Biden. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=935.2s)]
*  No, this is this is before you're sending me an article before what happened, not after [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=937.12s)]
*  you're talking about you're sending me an article about what happened and and or sorry, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=942.92s)]
*  you're you sent me an article about the potential largest rail union contract and not [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=951.76s)]
*  after Biden actually forced them back to work and then went back and extracted concessions [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=959.56s)]
*  from the railroad companies and the managers who then turned around and offered some of [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=965.2399999999999s)]
*  the concessions. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=972.8s)]
*  OK, Biden, after this, after this unfolded, Biden and even Pete Buttigieg, I hate to [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=973.92s)]
*  recognize this and Walsh, Marty Walsh went back to the fucking companies and forced them [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=981.88s)]
*  to offer paid sick leave. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=990.4399999999999s)]
*  OK, they did that, which is why there are articles from the railroad unions themselves [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=993.16s)]
*  after this November 21st, 2022 date that say that they celebrate the the concessions that [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1001.68s)]
*  they were able to get. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1008.6s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1009.8399999999999s)]

*  This or rather the failure of this to be presented as a solid W for the Biden administration [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1015.52s)]
*  is once again the fault of the Biden administration. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1023.4s)]
*  For sure, they should have communicated this to the public, but you should know better [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1027.08s)]
*  because I've talked about this a million times over. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1031.8799999999999s)]
*  OK, one must ask the question why these railroad unions have endorsed the Democratic [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1034.8s)]
*  Party if they were so unhappy with it. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1040.56s)]

*  rail workers. Your whole narrative on this is warped. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1047.12s)]
*  Four days is not a W. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1049.56s)]
*  Dog, when Palestinians want something, I'm not going to sit here. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1051.1599999999999s)]
*  I'm not going to sit here and be like, I'm out flanking the Palestinians on this issue. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1057.8s)]
*  OK, when the railroad unions are happy with the concessions that were extracted from the [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1061.8s)]
*  companies, I'm not going to outflank them because Twitch chatters don't agree with the [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1069.52s)]
*  decision. OK, that's it. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1074.4s)]
*  Yeah, we never stopped applying pressure. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1076.96s)]
*  Hard fought success on Rail sick days. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1078.72s)]
*  If you as a chatter have reservations about this, you can send me. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1080.68s)]
*  Maybe I have not seen it. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1084.88s)]
*  Maybe you've seen something that I am oblivious to and unfamiliar with. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1086.56s)]
*  OK, but everything that I've read on the matter, everything that I have read on the matter [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1090.76s)]
*  shows that the unions were happy with any of the concessions that they were able to get. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1095.9599999999998s)]
*  OK, why push back against the Dems at all then? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1101.3999999999999s)]
*  Because the Democrats are incredibly right wing on immigration and have adopted the [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1104.4399999999998s)]
*  positions that the that the Republican Party held on to during in the twenty twenty [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1108.8799999999999s)]

*  I don't know if you guys know this, but they're funding and facilitating a genocide with [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1117.24s)]
*  your tax dollars. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1121.76s)]
*  So obviously, I'm always going to be honest with you backpedaling Andy. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1123.52s)]
*  I think you're too stupid to understand anything that I'm talking about here. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1128.28s)]
*  What do I always tell you? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1132.76s)]
*  I will always be honest with you. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1134.28s)]
*  You ask me on if you ask me what the Democrats are doing in terms of like in terms of how [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1135.44s)]
*  they fought for workers rights. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1142.04s)]
*  OK, they are significantly better, not only better than the alternative, but significantly [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1144.32s)]
*  better than previous Democratic Party Democrat administrations. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1151.6399999999999s)]
*  Following 2019. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1155.36s)]
*  Yeah, that's probably a Dvor Chelly fan. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1156.48s)]
*  You always eat this bait. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1159.56s)]
*  Do you get bored of doing this a thousand times? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1160.68s)]
*  I don't think it's bait when there is plenty of people, plenty of new people that literally [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1162.6s)]
*  come back and and say the same thing. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1167.32s)]
*  OK, this is this is it would be bait if this would be bait if many people didn't just see [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1171.1599999999999s)]
*  this. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1177.8s)]
*  OK, and never this. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1178.6799999999998s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1180.6799999999998s)]
*  And it's not for you because you've heard it a million times over from me. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1181.84s)]
*  It's for all the people that haven't heard it yet. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1185.28s)]
*  Oh, that one chatter that said the railroad unions actually hated this contract has not [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1187.6399999999999s)]
*  given me an actual link or any kind of communications from a railroad labor union that [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1194.08s)]
*  openly said they hate the contract. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1201.76s)]
*  OK, I'm waiting for it. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1203.84s)]
*  Anyway, these are incredibly diverse. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1205.72s)]
*  When people act like labor unions are comprised of like, you know, hardhat wearing white [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1208.52s)]
*  working class reactionaries, they're stupid. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1213.56s)]
*  They're running on a Nixon era anti-hippie messaging strategy from right wing populists. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1216.72s)]
*  OK, it is that is where it originally started. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1224.68s)]
*  I hate this argument. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1228.96s)]
*  It's very stupid. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1230.52s)]
*  Labor unions are comprised of women who care about abortion. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1232.16s)]
*  Labor unions are comprised of gay people who care about, you know, gay rights. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1236.76s)]
*  Labor unions are comprised of black and brown people. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1241.72s)]
*  OK, but yeah. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1244.88s)]
*  On cultural issues, too, is the case many workers feel deeply alienated from the liberal [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1246.3200000000002s)]
*  perspective in conversation with team members and officers is clear that even among [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1250.28s)]
*  Democrats and Harris supporters, there's a frustration and awareness towards many of [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1253.3200000000002s)]
*  the cultural positions Democrats endorse and how those positions are defended until the [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1256.76s)]
*  party is able to change this image and truly identify with the working class on economic [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1260.5600000000002s)]
*  as well as cultural terms. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1263.96s)]
*  We should expect to see continued deterioration of working class support for Democratic [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1265.3600000000001s)]
*  candidates. The real problem with the Democratic Party is that they do not communicate to [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1268.8400000000001s)]
*  working class problems. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1274.76s)]
*  They don't even communicate the culture war issues that much any longer anyway. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1276.92s)]
*  They just basically are running on vibes. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1281.3600000000001s)]
*  OK, we are not Trump and we are doing vibes. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1284.2s)]
*  That's all they're doing. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1287.8s)]
*  I'm not sitting here and telling you that Democrats are running a good campaign, one [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1289.32s)]
*  that is an objectively pro worker campaign. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1293.0s)]
*  But if you look at the track record of the Democratic Party, especially in these past [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1295.32s)]
*  four years in terms of domestic labor issues, they are far better than every other [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1298.72s)]
*  contemporary US administration. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1306.92s)]
*  It is not even a question. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1309.4s)]
*  OK, the truth is still the truth. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1311.28s)]
*  I'm sorry. You know, if that's the calculation that you're doing, if that's the case, you [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1314.76s)]
*  know, that's fair. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1320.3200000000002s)]
*  Oh, my God. Brandon Brokaw, strike Lamau. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1322.04s)]
*  I'm going to Brian me. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1324.8400000000001s)]
*  I'm going to Brian me. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1326.4s)]
*  OK, for a lot of people, if the education that you get on labor issues exclusively relies [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1327.32s)]
*  on a TikTok video that you watched and you're going to come in here and repeat it to me, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1333.24s)]
*  a person that that TikToker probably watched and didn't watch ever again, you're not going [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1338.3999999999999s)]
*  to see the full picture. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1343.52s)]
*  OK, I'm sorry, chatters, but you are wrong on this. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1345.36s)]
*  And I have repeated it so many times that I literally repeated it three minutes ago. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1349.24s)]
*  OK, three minutes that I could have used serving an ad break. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1355.52s)]
*  Oh, my God. Everyone is there. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1359.52s)]
*  It is. This isn't even the right one. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1361.0800000000002s)]
*  This isn't the right article. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1363.04s)]
*  Anyway, here's a three minute break now. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1364.44s)]
*  OK, I'm not going to repeat myself one more time on this issue. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1366.72s)]
*  Let's hear what he has to say. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1369.92s)]
*  When you have an audience, you can influence that audience. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1371.1200000000001s)]
*  We figured that was going to lean heavily towards President Biden, and it didn't lean [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1373.76s)]
*  heavily towards him. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1377.8s)]
*  And then we did the poll with 40,000 of our members participated in that. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1379.2s)]
*  That's a 60 percent poll. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1382.96s)]
*  The other 58 percent poll that you see. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1384.16s)]
*  And then we did the research based polls and two out of those three polls leaned [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1386.0800000000002s)]
*  Republican. So, again, I'll get back to there's a lot of work that got to be done. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1391.4s)]
*  Our members. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1395.96s)]
*  One of the things that frustrates me about this stuff is that like it is perfectly valid [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1396.88s)]
*  to demand more from the Democratic Party. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1401.2800000000002s)]
*  It's the good thing to do is the right thing to do. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1403.8400000000001s)]
*  But if you're going to drop it, this took two seconds to find. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1406.72s)]
*  Wait, what? The rail workers did not get everything they asked for when Brighton [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1409.68s)]
*  broke the rail strike. Your answer to this is literally a Reddit vent, dude. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1412.8s)]
*  Like, how was that? This is just an effort posting chatter at that point to which the [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1419.12s)]
*  response was Biden deserves a lot of the credit for achieving this goal for us from [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1423.6399999999999s)]
*  the IBEV Railroad director. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1427.72s)]
*  He and his team continue to work behind the scenes to get the rail labor affair agreement [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1430.48s)]
*  for paid sick leave. We're thankful to the Biden administration, played the long game [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1434.12s)]
*  on sick days and stuck with us for months after Congress imposed our updated national [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1437.2s)]
*  agreement. It's a purple line. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1441.08s)]
*  I'm not going to show this link because I've showed this goddamn link a million times [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1442.96s)]
*  on this broadcast whenever people come in here because I've shown this link literally [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1448.08s)]
*  five minutes ago. In this situation, you as if you're a Railroad Union member, a rank [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1452.48s)]
*  and filer, and you have issues with the new agreement that you, I guess, democratically [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1462.08s)]
*  That's one thing because that's what happened. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1469.2s)]
*  Okay. And this happens all the time. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1471.52s)]
*  There are tentative agreements and then there are ultimately there are concessions. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1475.24s)]
*  There's back and forth. There are negotiations that take place and then contracts are [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1479.28s)]
*  brought back by the union leadership that's democratically elected to the rank and [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1484.76s)]
*  filers. Okay. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1490.44s)]
*  And the rank and file vote to ratify the contract. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1492.96s)]
*  Do you understand? [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1497.64s)]
*  And in that process, there are people who wanted more for sure. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1498.92s)]
*  They want more. And that's perfectly understandable. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1502.8s)]
*  But if we're having a conversation about like what the unions, what the unions opinion [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1506.8s)]
*  is across the board, the unions opinion across the board are that they are they are [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1511.92s)]
*  happy with at least some of the concessions that they were able to get due to the [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1517.64s)]
*  consistent pressure that they say the Biden administration put on the railroad [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1522.72s)]
*  companies. Okay. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1528.04s)]
*  At that point, I feel like at that point, I feel like y'all are just like, you know, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1529.68s)]
*  you're outflanking the rank and filer. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1533.92s)]
*  That's it. Broski, it was just for information. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1536.1200000000001s)]
*  Might be. Let's move on. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1538.24s)]
*  Even now, I'm getting cancer in this. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1539.52s)]
*  Thanks, Broski. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1541.4s)]
*  Get back to Sean O'Brien's hog ass. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1542.8400000000001s)]
*  You know, paying attention and again, no endorsement, I think, sends a message to [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1546.16s)]
*  both parties that if they truly want to support working people, they have to [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1552.2s)]
*  reevaluate it and understand that nothing is given. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1555.68s)]
*  It is earned. All right. I don't mean to disrespect here, but no endorsement also [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1558.8s)]
*  means you can have it both ways and you're not taking a stand. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1563.1200000000001s)]
*  No, we're not looking to have it both ways at all. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1568.4s)]
*  I take a stand every day. I call balls and strikes. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1570.56s)]
*  You know, there's some great Democrats that supported us. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1572.68s)]
*  President Biden, you know, passed pension legislation that fixed our pensions. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1575.44s)]
*  But the reality of it is, again, I've said this time and time again, we fix they fix [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1580.8400000000001s)]
*  problems that were created a long time ago. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1585.4s)]
*  Trucking deregulation costs 400000 teams to jobs. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1587.28s)]
*  Companies went into bankruptcy, which which destroyed pension funds. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1590.96s)]
*  So, you know, although they fixed the problem, you know, some of us created those problems [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1594.64s)]
*  that had to be fixed. And, you know, look, it's different times. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1599.48s)]
*  Our members are different. A lot of people, there's a lot of social issues out there [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1602.5600000000002s)]
*  where sometimes our members are focused clearly on the social issues, not taking a [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1605.6000000000001s)]
*  position, is not having it both ways. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1609.28s)]
*  This country is divided down the middle. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1612.08s)]
*  It's my goal, just like we've done with our union, is to bring this together, work [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1614.2s)]
*  bipartisan and get some stuff done like the Pro Act, like bankruptcy reform and [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1617.48s)]
*  other. If he gets a single Republican vote on the Pro Act, I'll eat my hat. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1621.68s)]
*  OK, like he thinks Josh Hawley is going to vote for it. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1626.76s)]
*  You know what I mean? Issues that affect our members. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1630.52s)]
*  You know, did this turn in any way, Sean, I think you were critical of President [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1632.92s)]
*  Trump after his interview where he was going back and forth with Elon Musk and [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1637.6s)]
*  others about when you can fire, get rid of workers and that he admired that that [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1644.48s)]
*  that ability. And it's always funny what's his face. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1651.0s)]
*  Neil Cavado is like being more woke than Sean O'Brien. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1655.0s)]
*  This is not the first time this has happened. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1660.4399999999998s)]
*  When the Fox News guy is like, how do you contend with the fact that the guy that [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1662.84s)]
*  you're like kind of hyping up laughed about, you know, striking workers being fired, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1666.96s)]
*  which is, you know, illegal, just illegal. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1673.48s)]
*  And and you were quite vehement about it. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1676.72s)]
*  And I just thought that might have represented a turning point. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1678.88s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, obviously, words have consequences, right? [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1682.64s)]
*  Statements have consequences. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1685.8s)]
*  And I will, you know, I called former President Trump out, just like I would call [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1687.4s)]
*  anybody else that tries to retaliate or make fun of people being terminated for [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1692.0s)]
*  exercising their right to strike. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1696.56s)]
*  But when we asked both candidates in the presidential forum roundtables about [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1698.1599999999999s)]
*  supporting our railway workers and workers that are under the RLA to strike and not [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1703.24s)]
*  interfere, we couldn't get strong commitments from either candidate. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1707.52s)]
*  So, you know, that was a major factor in our decision making. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1710.3999999999999s)]
*  But back to your point, unacceptable for anybody to fire workers for exercising their [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1714.28s)]
*  right and or gloat about it. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1720.52s)]
*  So it's no secret. I'm not a big fan of Elon Musk. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1722.0s)]
*  OK, that I do remember. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1724.8s)]
*  But let me then step back and get your thoughts on on that relationship, because [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1726.68s)]
*  Elon Musk apparently might have a great sway in a potential Trump administration. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1731.56s)]
*  And even when it comes to looking at the government books and looking at how the [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1736.96s)]
*  government spends its money, did that weigh in? [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1741.92s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1745.0800000000002s)]
*  Famously, if given the opportunity, Donald Trump would be like, oh, dude, the RLA, I [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1746.92s)]
*  love that. Definitely. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1753.3999999999999s)]
*  So one must look at in between these two candidates like if neither are saying that [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1755.24s)]
*  if neither are supporting railroad labor unions after exhausting all options, being [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1762.7199999999998s)]
*  given the opportunity to strike, if neither candidate supports that, what are the [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1770.76s)]
*  actual things that you're getting from potentially Donald Trump? [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1776.28s)]
*  Like what? What are the things? [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1780.9599999999998s)]
*  Like, is there anything at all? [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1782.72s)]
*  Is there anything that you can ever get from Donald Trump at all? [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1784.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, we can't we can't look to see ghosts. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1788.2s)]
*  I've got one point three million of the strongest people in the world, and that's our [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1791.6s)]
*  rank and file members. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1795.52s)]
*  And, you know, although there may be a difference of opinions or there may be [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1796.9199999999998s)]
*  criticisms, if we have to go to fight, fight with corporate America and the Elon Musk [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1799.8s)]
*  of the world, I like my chances. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1804.8799999999999s)]
*  OK, so let me just get a sense of where you go from here, because your colleagues at [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1806.8799999999999s)]
*  other unions, by and large, have been going hook, line and sinker for Kamala Harris. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1813.28s)]
*  And I know your members went polled on this. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1819.28s)]
*  And I know these can be erratic polls. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1822.08s)]
*  They're not scientific polls. I know how they go. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1823.68s)]
*  Liked Joe Biden a lot more than Kamala Harris. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1825.44s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1828.84s)]
*  Joe Biden, I think they believe in our polls. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1830.24s)]
*  I can't speak for anything else. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1833.08s)]
*  But, you know, they polled about 25 percent to 30 percent popularity without members [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1835.48s)]
*  consistently. So I'm sorry, compared to President Trump, though, he scored higher, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1840.16s)]
*  did he not? He scored higher. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1845.6s)]
*  He did. Yes. OK. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1847.3600000000001s)]
*  Kamala Harris does not. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1848.72s)]
*  No, she does not. So they're not psyched about her. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1850.72s)]
*  They're more psyched about Donald Trump. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1853.92s)]
*  I don't think they're psyched about both candidates. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1856.08s)]
*  You know, there's issues that are specific to. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1859.24s)]
*  Dude, you are the leader of one of the largest labor unions in North America. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1862.6s)]
*  Like, if your rank and file is not excited about one candidate over the other, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1867.6799999999998s)]
*  like it is your job to at least show the different ways in which either party would be [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1873.56s)]
*  helpful for just one cause and one cause only doing right by your rank and file workers. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1878.1599999999999s)]
*  I feel like I'm crazy for like the the the communication here is is a little ridiculous. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1885.64s)]
*  There is no world there is no world in which any labor union should ever even remotely [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1892.76s)]
*  stand alongside Donald Trump. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1899.48s)]
*  I've been saying this. I've been saying this from the start. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1902.4s)]
*  Like when he first met with Trump, I was like, oh, my God, here we go. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1905.8400000000001s)]
*  What our members want and need. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1909.3200000000002s)]
*  And, you know, this polling wasn't just a vote. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1911.24s)]
*  There were issues and questions posed within this polling that our members asked. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1914.1599999999999s)]
*  So, you know, I think this process and I guess, you know, I'll get back to, you know, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1918.9199999999998s)]
*  people are sick of it. People are sick of the name calling. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1924.9599999999998s)]
*  People are sick of tearing each other apart because they support one candidate versus the other. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1927.1999999999998s)]
*  And I think it's just, you know, people are fed up and they want it over with. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1932.6399999999999s)]
*  I want it over with, to be honest with you. We do great work. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1936.8s)]
*  We negotiate the strongest contracts. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1939.1599999999999s)]
*  We're organizing thousands of members each month. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1940.7199999999998s)]
*  That's what our focus needs to be on. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1943.6s)]
*  All right. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1945.32s)]
*  If L.C.O., United Auto Workers Union, they're strong Democrat. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1946.12s)]
*  They're going to for Kamala Harris service workers, maybe because of Donald Trump and, [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1949.7199999999998s)]
*  you know, the original proponent of getting rid of the tax on tips seems to lead his way. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1955.12s)]
*  Your opinion is that we should not outflank the choice of the union and the rail contract. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1961.6799999999998s)]
*  Why are you willing to outflank Teamsters? [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1964.76s)]
*  He could be using his levers to play both sides and try to push calmly, give him a better deal. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1966.4399999999998s)]
*  No, he hasn't communicated that at all. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1969.76s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1972.76s)]
*  That's what my issue is. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwBzMBFkeg&t=1974.04s)]
