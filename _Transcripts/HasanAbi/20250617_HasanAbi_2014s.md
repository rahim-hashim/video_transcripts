# They’re Afraid Of Zohran Mamdani | HasanAbi Archive
**HasanAbi:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc)
*  Zoran is pretty good at doing this where he's like giving Islamophobia, sweetie, without [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=0.0s)]
*  being 2014 Tumblr with it, you know, because at the end of the day, that is what it is. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=6.1000000000000005s)]
*  Being afraid of Arabic words, Lee, the most nonsense around by the way, Ted Cruz says [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=12.1s)]
*  he has no idea what the population or ethnic mix of Iran is. He wants to help us. He wants [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=23.18s)]
*  to help Israel country anyway. I don't know the population at all. No, I don't know the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=27.54s)]
*  population. You don't know the population of the country you seek to topple. How many [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=33.22s)]
*  people living around 92 million? Okay. I can't believe. Come on. That's come on. Come on, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=38.06s)]
*  dude. He thought he could have got him there. Oh my God. Oh my God. What is happening? Why [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=46.980000000000004s)]
*  am I? What is this? What is this realignment happening? What the why is Tucker Carlson [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=53.26s)]
*  on the right side of this? How is this happening? Please stop. How many people are on the way? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=59.94s)]
*  I don't know the population at all. No, I don't know the population. You don't know [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=66.42s)]
*  the population of the country you seek to topple. How many people living around 92 million? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=71.25999999999999s)]
*  No, no, no, no. This man literally is the son of a CIA agent. This is the son of a CIA [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=77.7s)]
*  agent. He is a white nationalist through and through. And not only that, but also, he quite [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=88.02s)]
*  literally used to say we have to on Iran is a primitive country. I can't believe this man [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=94.53999999999999s)]
*  is on the right side of this of this issue. Yeah. How could you not know that? I don't [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=101.25999999999999s)]
*  sit around memorizing population tables. Well, it's kind of relevant because you're [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=106.98s)]
*  calling for the overthrow of the government. Why is it relevant? Whether it will be because [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=110.82000000000001s)]
*  90 million or 80 million or 100 million? Why is that relevant? You don't know anything [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=114.54s)]
*  about the country. I didn't say I don't know anything about it. What's the ethnic mix of [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=117.7s)]
*  Iran? They are Persians and predominantly Shia. OK, this is you don't know anything [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=120.54s)]
*  about Iran. So I am not the Tucker Carlson expert on Iran. You're a senator who's calling [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=125.98s)]
*  for the overthrow of the government. You're the one who claims you're the one who claims [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=132.5s)]
*  No, you don't know anything about the country. You're the one who claims they're not trying [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=135.89999999999998s)]
*  to murder Donald Trump. You know, I'm not saying that who can't figure out a saying [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=138.82s)]
*  that. General Soleimani, you said it was bad. They're trying to murder Trump. Yes, I guess [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=142.7s)]
*  you're not calling for military strikes against them in retaliation. And if you really believe [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=148.77999999999997s)]
*  that carrying out military strikes today, you said Israel was right with our help. I [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=152.54s)]
*  said we Israel is leading them, but we're supporting them with this. You're breaking [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=157.61999999999998s)]
*  news here because the U.S. government last night denied the National Security Council [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=161.1s)]
*  spokesman Alex Pfeiffer denied on behalf of Trump that we were acting on Israel's behalf [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=165.01999999999998s)]
*  in any offensive capacity. We're not in Israel's. You just said we were. We are supporting [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=170.18s)]
*  Israel. You're a senator. If you're saying the United States government is a war with [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=176.26s)]
*  Iran right now, people are listening to. Dude, John Schwarz says I've always dreamed of interviews [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=180.06s)]
*  asking basic questions of the killer clowns who run America. I can't believe it took Tucker [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=184.34s)]
*  Carlson to do it. It is remarkable that all it took for this level of access and deep [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=189.38s)]
*  comfort from Republican senators that you can interview without any sort of editorial [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=195.14000000000001s)]
*  restrictions would only come at the tail end of a 30 year career being a hatchet man for [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=202.78s)]
*  every Republican administration. Like Tucker Carlson is doing basic journalism. OK, this [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=212.5s)]
*  is super basic stuff. I cannot believe that Ted Cruz gave this interview to Tucker Carlson. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=218.82s)]
*  And I suspect it's because he has a sense of comfort with Tucker. He has a rapport with [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=227.98s)]
*  Tucker because Tucker Carlson has played, I guess, the long days. Tucker saying Iran [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=233.57999999999998s)]
*  deserves to be years ago. Yeah. Aren't we the only country allowed to make preemptive [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=239.85999999999999s)]
*  strikes? Who the hell does Iran think it is? Actually, I know you're sort of kidding, but [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=243.66s)]
*  I agree with that. I think we are the only no, I'm not kidding. We are. That's absolutely [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=248.66s)]
*  the only country with the moral authority sufficient to do that. The only country that [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=252.34s)]
*  doesn't seek hegemony in the world. I do think I'm sure I'm alone. We're the only country [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=255.3s)]
*  that doesn't seek hegemony in the world. Tucker Carlson said in 2012. I mean, respect, respect [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=259.98s)]
*  to him doing this now. He also said this about Fox News, which I don't even know what's going [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=264.54s)]
*  on there. So Carlson says Fox is a propaganda network that manipulates their mostly elderly [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=269.18s)]
*  audience. He should know he played a role in it, a formative role in this claim. That's [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=273.7s)]
*  not like their viewer surveys. Like, you know, we need a lot more Mark Levin, less Jesse [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=278.5s)]
*  Waters, more Mark Levin. What they're doing is what they always do, which is just turning [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=281.97999999999996s)]
*  up the propaganda hose to full blast and just trying to, you know, knock elderly Fox viewers [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=289.09999999999997s)]
*  off their feet and make them submit. This is this. So he freaks me out every time he [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=295.96s)]
*  laughs like a monster. His fake laugh is so alarming. I still, I still hate Tucker Carlson, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=301.06s)]
*  but he cooked like unconditionally cooked here. This is fantastic. This clip is supposed [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=312.62s)]
*  to be an attack on Zoran. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=318.85999999999996s)]
*  Bullwork podcast says globalizing the father chance signifies to him a call for passing [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=320.17999999999995s)]
*  human rights as the word is being used by the Holocaust museum and translating the Warsaw [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=324.85999999999996s)]
*  uprising into Arabic because it's a word that means struggle. Okay. This is correct. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=328.62s)]
*  So what's the, what's the attack? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=333.06s)]
*  Who I would say am, am less comfortable with the idea of banning the use of certain words [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=334.38s)]
*  and that I think it is more evocative of a Trump style approach to how to lead a country. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=341.22s)]
*  And I think especially when we've seen [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=351.82s)]
*  Sure. Like does that just make you uncomfortable? Like the phrase globalizing to father from [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=354.38s)]
*  the river to the sea. Does that make you uncomfortable or do you think those are different? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=357.97999999999996s)]
*  Those are super different. I'm sorry. I'm asking Zoran and they're not really different [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=362.02s)]
*  to me. And so some people are not different. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=367.78s)]
*  Oh my God, bullwork. God damn it. Tim Miller. Holy. You know, I, I, I know people for whom [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=370.18s)]
*  those things mean very different things. And, and to me, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=377.38s)]
*  Cam cam is on a bullwork now and he's the reason why this Zoran thing is happening to begin with [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=381.97999999999996s)]
*  friend of the show, Cameron Caskey and bullwork is like, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=390.78s)]
*  bullwork is like the, the rhinos, the, the never Trump Republicans who are super lived up now. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=396.78s)]
*  Ultimately, what I hear in so many is a desperate desire for equality and equal rights in [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=403.5s)]
*  standing up for Palestinian human rights. And I, Tim also, hey, I don't think he likes me too much. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=412.05999999999995s)]
*  Imagining me and Tucker Carlson in a bar fight and suddenly we realized that just for the next five [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=416.85999999999996s)]
*  seconds, we're fighting the same people. I've never seen tech crews this pissed off before [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=420.53999999999996s)]
*  downright outfoxed by a basic reading of Wikipedia. This clip is going to earn so much for Tucker [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=425.02s)]
*  Carlson. He's going to get so much cred. I think what's difficult also is that the very word is, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=432.05999999999995s)]
*  has been used by the Holocaust museum when translating the Warsaw ghetto uprising into [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=439.66s)]
*  Arabic because it's a word that means struggle. And as a Muslim man who grew up post 9 11, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=444.94s)]
*  I'm all too familiar in the way in which Arabic words can be twisted, can be distorted, can be [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=453.5s)]
*  used to justify any kind of [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=458.62s)]
*  Tim Allredy Damn lightest way, lightest way of checking them. Zoran is pretty good at doing this, where he's [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=460.54s)]
*  like, giving Islamophobia, sweetie, without being 2014 Tumblr with it. You know, because at the end [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=467.1s)]
*  of the day, that is what it is. Being afraid of Arabic words, the most nonsense, we don't do that [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=473.90000000000003s)]
*  for anything else. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=480.86s)]
*  Tim Kind of meaning. And I think that's, that's where it leaves me with a sense that what we need to do is, is [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=483.22s)]
*  focus on keeping Jewish New Yorkers safe. And the question of the permissibility of language is something [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=488.62s)]
*  that I, that I haven't, I haven't [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=497.82s)]
*  Twitter period left his hey, Zoran doesn't crash out and explain things calmly. Yeah, Zoran mum Donnie's [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=500.38s)]
*  remarks first reported by Matthew Castle. per credible reports or on mum Donnie is days away from developing a new [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=505.58000000000004s)]
*  weapon. Yeah, I, I've been very careful and I've been very worried that they were just gonna, they were trying to, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=512.86s)]
*  they were trying to, Zoran and they're gonna still shut them like this, but I don't think this works. Rabbi Mark [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=523.02s)]
*  Schneider of Hampton Synagogue and friend of Cuomo calls on mum Donnie to immediately apologize to New York [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=529.66s)]
*  City's Jewish community for equating into fight with the Warsaw ghetto uprising. Schneider says a direct [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=533.82s)]
*  insult to Holocaust survivors and families. Yeah. All Zoran needs to do is stand next to one Holocaust [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=537.42s)]
*  survivor. Okay. Who says, no, that's not the case. That's it. Pack it up. Get one like 97 year old anti-Zionist [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=543.9s)]
*  Jewish guy who survived the Holocaust gig, Gabor Monte on there, somebody. Okay. And just turn around [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=555.8199999999999s)]
*  and be like, Nope, great. Would be a great service as well. I posted it on my IG story to vote for [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=562.46s)]
*  Zoran and two family members immediately replied saying, you know, he's anti-Semitic, right? And [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=567.9000000000001s)]
*  then they followed up with a canary mission video. Nice. At this point. Yeah. I saw the Rabani joke [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=571.02s)]
*  about Zoran mum Donnie. Yeah. He got, he got the Bernie endorsement today, which is the Bernie [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=576.86s)]
*  endorsement is just like, I mean, it's consequential, but it's nowhere near as consequential as the AOC [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=583.58s)]
*  one was. We're so close to election day, but believe it or not, the hardest days of this race [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=588.7s)]
*  are yet to come because right now Andrew Cuomo and isn't it, isn't it, is it maybe they use Jewish [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=593.74s)]
*  people as a human shield like Israel's doing right now? No, when Israel does it, it's awesome. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=597.5s)]
*  And if you call it out, then it's up. But no, I think like this is a performance is doing this [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=602.0600000000001s)]
*  to defend Cuomo and to attack Zoran. And it's an election. So he should follow through on that [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=609.1800000000001s)]
*  performance and be like, see, that's not true. Cause that rabbi is using his position of authority [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=615.98s)]
*  and his Jewish background to launch a, a totally ridiculous smear of antisemitism towards someone [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=621.34s)]
*  who is not anti-Semitic at all. And therefore the best response would be to do the optic play [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=630.78s)]
*  and literally have a Holocaust survivor or maybe like norm Finkelstein come out and be like, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbA0KrKgpSc&t=637.5s)]
