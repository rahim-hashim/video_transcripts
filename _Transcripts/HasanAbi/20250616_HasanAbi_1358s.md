# Israel Just Attack A News Station | HasanAbi Archive
**HasanAbi:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4)
*  the Republican base would fall apart. Like they, I don't know if they would be as horny to go to war with Iran or if they would be advocating directly to like Tel Aviv or some shit. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=0.0s)]
*  Cause I feel like, like even if it, even if it had nothing to do with Israel, even if there was a nine 11 style attack that took place again on us soil at this stage, given how every American is prime [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=10.0s)]
*  prime. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=22.0s)]
*  At this hour, the G seven summit is officially underway in Canada and us president Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney are now taking part in a bilateral meeting on the sidelines. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=28.0s)]
*  Now before that conversation started Trump criticized the G seven for rejecting Russia 11 years earlier after Moscow annexed Crimea. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=39.0s)]
*  The G seven countries, which also include France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the UK have a lot to discuss over the next few days. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=48.0s)]
*  Hi on the agenda, global trade and security. However, looming over the summit, the Israel Iran conflict, which is now in its fourth day and intensifying Iran state news agency says that it has been targeted by Israeli strike. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=55.0s)]
*  As you just saw there, the attack happened while a live newscast was underway. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=70.0s)]
*  You saw the news anchor essentially evacuate the studio very quickly. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=82.0s)]
*  Earlier Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged Iranians to evacuate the Capitol as the death toll on both sides continues to grow. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=85.0s)]
*  Iranian officials say that at least 224 people, most of them civilians, have been since Israel launched a wave of a strikes on Iranian nuclear. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=93.0s)]
*  And yeah, last night it was Emily Schrader or whatever. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=102.0s)]
*  One of those dumbass Hasbarist was talking about how Israel should strike the national broadcaster of Iran. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=105.0s)]
*  And then less than 24 hours after that demand on Twitter, Israel actually did strike the national broadcaster of Iran, which is so insane. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=113.0s)]
*  Like it blows my mind every single day. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=122.0s)]
*  There is a new form of depravity where it's like getting, getting your strike priorities, getting your targets from like Twitter users is so psychotic. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=130.0s)]
*  But then again, yeah, it reminds me of what Barry Weiss did when she called for the assassination of ref out all right. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=139.0s)]
*  And then it literally happened. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=145.0s)]
*  I designed his propagandist. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=147.0s)]
*  Emily Schrader gloats about having putting target on Iranian journalists and having enacted as she herself claims to be a journalist. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=149.0s)]
*  So Iran, you know what to do, follow her own standard. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=154.0s)]
*  I can't believe it. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=163.0s)]
*  Like we read this last night. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=164.0s)]
*  She bravely came back on air moments later. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=166.0s)]
*  The building of the Islamic Republic. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=171.0s)]
*  A clear example of opposition to freedom of speech. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=176.0s)]
*  It is not the building that was bombed. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=180.0s)]
*  It's the freedom of speech and the voice of truth that was bombed. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=182.0s)]
*  In a powerful act of defiance, Iranian national broadcaster, anchorwoman Saad Emami returned live on air minutes after the Israeli struck her TV building. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=185.0s)]
*  No PTSD unshaken, powerful and confident. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=192.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=194.0s)]
*  Oh, there was also a cyber attack launched in against Channel 14. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=195.0s)]
*  We come out. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=199.0s)]
*  What is that response, dude? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=224.0s)]
*  And military targets. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=229.0s)]
*  Israel says at least 24 people have been by Iranian missiles that penetrated its Iron Dome defense shield. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=232.0s)]
*  Elena Trane is in Washington. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=238.0s)]
*  First, let's go to Nick Payton Walsh, who joins us off the side of the building that we saw. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=240.0s)]
*  And Nick Walker, our viewers, through what we just saw happening on Iranian state television there. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=243.0s)]
*  As these two sides have increased the salvos against each other, some reports suggesting that Iran is desperately looking for an off ramp. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=248.0s)]
*  Where do things stand? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=257.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's extraordinary to see the state broadcaster hit like that. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=258.0s)]
*  Iranian officials justing this indeed was what it appears to be, which is an Israeli strike on that particular building, interrupting it or interrupting certainly its journey. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=264.0s)]
*  I'm an Israeli Israeli media censoring the strike so bad they try to hide the destruction and death that we Israelis have never seen so that we wouldn't go to war against. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=274.0s)]
*  We wouldn't go against this war with Iran. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=282.0s)]
*  There are like 20 plus civilian deaths in a few days in regular times that would be spoken about for way more air time. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=284.0s)]
*  By the way, the two last Iranian attacks were smallest and 10 rockets judging by the booms. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=289.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think there is more coming. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=293.0s)]
*  I think that even the drones haven't arrived. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=297.0s)]
*  So I don't think that it's like done, even though the IDF said it is. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=300.0s)]
*  I don't think that the I don't think that it's actually done at all, especially considering that Iran said, especially considering that Iran said that this was going to be like the most painful night yet or whatever. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=303.0s)]
*  I don't really get why Iran is talking tough for years, but when it's going down, they try to avoid the confrontation. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=313.0s)]
*  I mean, why tough talk then? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=318.0s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=319.0s)]
*  They don't want to. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=320.0s)]
*  They don't want the smoke. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=321.0s)]
*  Air raid sirens go off in Tel Aviv. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=322.0s)]
*  Iran says massive fire at the nevah team air base largest and most intense attack in history on Israeli. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=325.0s)]
*  Yeah, good luck. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=331.0s)]
*  This is the most we'll see from this. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=332.0s)]
*  OK, impact recorded in the South, possibly never team air base. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=334.0s)]
*  Yeah, they will never. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=338.0s)]
*  This is the type of shit that is super illegal in Israel, by the way. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=340.0s)]
*  This this image right here, the Associated Press, Jerusalem broadcast feed is down. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=343.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think they came after all the live streams. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=347.0s)]
*  They're cutting all the live streams off. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=350.0s)]
*  They're coming Hassan. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=352.0s)]
*  Iran and TV. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=353.0s)]
*  What has happened so far was the result of the launch of cruise ballistic have not yet reached the occupied territories. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=354.0s)]
*  This is from seven minutes ago on Hasnim. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=359.0s)]
*  I guess this feels like a threat. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=362.0s)]
*  It's giving Gold Pager is really prime minister Netanyahu words of America of incoming attack. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=365.0s)]
*  Today is Tel Aviv. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=369.0s)]
*  Tomorrow is New York. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=370.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=371.0s)]
*  They're going to manufacture 9 11. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=372.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=374.0s)]
*  They're going to do a 9 11 to run enters its fifth day. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=375.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=378.0s)]
*  Some air defense systems were launched in response, but Israel's military has since given the all clear. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=379.0s)]
*  Iran's Revolutionary Guard has warned strikes against Israeli territory will continue into Tuesday morning. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=384.0s)]
*  In recent days, several Iranians have evaded those. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=391.0s)]
*  I feel like that would backfire. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=394.0s)]
*  Dude, I'm serious. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=396.0s)]
*  Given the way that misinformation runs rampant. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=398.0s)]
*  Paired up with hatred towards Jews and Israel specifically, but Jews specifically because of Israel. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=403.0s)]
*  If there was another 9 11 style. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=409.0s)]
*  Incident. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=412.0s)]
*  I'm not even kidding when I say this. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=413.0s)]
*  I feel like the Republican base would fall apart like they I don't know if they would be as horny to go to war with Iran. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=414.0s)]
*  Or if they would be advocating directly to like Tel Aviv or some shit because I feel like. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=422.0s)]
*  Like even if it even if I had nothing to do with Israel, even if there was a 9 11 style attack that took place again on US soil at this stage, given how every American is primed to believe conspiracy theories rather than the truth that they can see the truth that they can feel the truth that they can touch. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=427.0s)]
*  Okay, I'm telling you right now. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=443.0s)]
*  I feel like Americans broadly would not be like this is we have to go to war with Iran. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=445.0s)]
*  I'm sure that there will be plenty of people who would be geared into sharing such sentiments, but there would be a tremendous number of people I think right now than ever before in American history that would be like, Nope, I don't believe it. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=450.0s)]
*  This was this was definitely Israel. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=465.0s)]
*  Journalists during that particular broadcast, we understand that this building may indeed be in district three in Tehran and the Israeli Defense Force putting out a statement in Farsi, the Iranian language telling people to evacuate that particular area hours prior to these images emerging. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=468.0s)]
*  Now we don't know the consequences of that particular attack, whether they're injured or dead as a result of it, but there have been increasing images emerging of strikes around Tehran and indeed Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying they control the skies over Western Iran and Tehran indeed. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=488.0s)]
*  And in fact, Israel's Defense Minister Israel Katz clear a matter of hours prior to those explosions that you saw there. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=503.0s)]
*  And I'm paraphrasing here that the regime's mouthpiece would indeed be silenced, not entirely clear if he was referring specifically to that state broadcaster, but certainly a coincidence. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=511.0s)]
*  Those words emerged just after the evacuation orders and prior to that particular explosion. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=521.0s)]
*  But increasing air reporting now and information we're getting about the sheer toll inside the capital and across Iran. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=527.0s)]
*  Does it make it more likely potentially that Iran seeks a diplomatic solution where they appear to have told regional mediators that they need the Israel strikes to stop before they can contemplate diplomacy? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=535.0s)]
*  And indeed, they also might be suggesting they want to have their own counter attacks get to a point where they feel they've to revenge or response or restored some kind of deterrent for Israel's extraordinary wave of strikes across Iranian military and other facilities over the past days. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=545.0s)]
*  But here is some information we're gleaning about the human toll of what we've seen in the past four days inside Iran. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=562.0s)]
*  Screams echo across the ordinary streets of Tehran. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=569.0s)]
*  The horrors in Iran are harder to find video of, but it's hard to watch when you do. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=577.0s)]
*  A deputy foreign minister posting this damage to his ministry. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=584.0s)]
*  Several civilians injured, he said. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=589.0s)]
*  Israel's defense minister clarified Monday he meant no harm to Tehran's residents when he said earlier the city would burn unless Iran's missiles stop. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=592.0s)]
*  But many have seen flames already and are fleeing the capital. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=602.0s)]
*  Nothing like this before in their lifetimes. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=606.0s)]
*  In the western city of Kermanshah, state media posted images of the intensive care unit of a hospital damaged. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=610.0s)]
*  The IDF told CNN they were quote, not aware of any attack that happened on a hospital in Iran, end quote. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=617.0s)]
*  And it's unclear if anyone was hurt. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=623.0s)]
*  But numbers Iran's health ministry have given speak of just how wide scale the Israeli onslaught has been. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=626.0s)]
*  Over 200 dead, 90% civilians since Friday, they said. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=632.0s)]
*  But each number its own story, many from the youth that the West sees as the hope for Iran's post-Aitollah future. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=638.0s)]
*  This is Tara Hajmiri dancing at the dentist killed alongside her family, said state media. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=646.0s)]
*  Also Niloufar Galevand, big in gyms and social media, age 31, killed alongside her parents. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=655.0s)]
*  And Pania Abassi, a poet, age 23, killed with her parents and brother. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=663.0s)]
*  Her poem, The Extinguished Star, reads, you and I will come to an end somewhere. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=669.0s)]
*  The most beautiful poem in the world falls quiet. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=675.0s)]
*  Now there appear to be images now emerging of the aftermath of what seems to have been a strike on that Iranian state broadcast. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=681.0s)]
*  I wonder if we can share them to you now. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=688.0s)]
*  It's CNN London. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=690.0s)]
*  Like this is the international news coverage of CNN, which usually is like early in the morning. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=691.0s)]
*  And it's also like it's earlier in the morning in America and it's usually way more forgiving of victims of Israeli violence as opposed to like later coverage. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=697.0s)]
*  But it's I mean, yeah, even then he just like showcases these people as like a hopeful post-Aitollah future of Iran. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=710.0s)]
*  That is the the humanization that you're going to get. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=718.0s)]
*  That's the maximum humanization that you're going to get. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=722.0s)]
*  Now, but I think in the hours ahead, potentially, given the scale of that evacuation order from District 3, maybe we'll see more images as it appears this tit for tat, the back and forth between Iran and Israel now heads into its fifth day. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=725.0s)]
*  All right, Nick, Peyton Walsh, live for us there. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=740.0s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=742.0s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=743.0s)]
*  Let me bring you in, because we saw at the top of the bilateral meeting between President Trump and, of course, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, excuse me, where they literally just sort of touched on what was happening with Iran and Israel right now. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=744.0s)]
*  One of the things that President Trump said towards the end is that Iran wants to talk because they know that they're not winning this. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=759.0s)]
*  But he would not answer a question. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=765.0s)]
*  This is I think is key. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=767.0s)]
*  He would not answer a question about what it would take for the U.S. to become more involved in this war. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=768.0s)]
*  Just give us your take on that. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=773.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, these are actually questions I should note from our colleague. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=775.0s)]
*  Guys, there I have no I'm not defending the Ayatollah at all. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=779.0s)]
*  OK, it would be wonderful for Iran to have democratic leadership, fully functioning secular government. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=785.0s)]
*  That'd be fantastic. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=793.0s)]
*  That's actually something that would be also tremendously popular amongst the Iranian population as well. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=795.0s)]
*  But that cannot come from outside forces that cannot come from outside forces trying to decapitate the fucking leadership. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=801.0s)]
*  It certainly could not come from Israel or the United States of America. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=810.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=815.0s)]
*  Like the idea that like these sorts of outside violent interference from outside forces, ones that have already through their endless destabilization and coup d'etat have ruined Iranian ruined any attempts at Iranian democracy. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=816.0s)]
*  Like this is a country. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=833.0s)]
*  This is a country that has already experienced tremendous outside intervention. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=836.0s)]
*  Their anger and resentment towards their current leadership is a direct consequence of previous incursions of outside intervention. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=842.0s)]
*  It's so it's so stupid to assume that like by and large, every Iranian living in Iran right now is looking at this and going, oh, please glass us more. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=850.0s)]
*  Are there people who have that kind of attitude? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=860.0s)]
*  I'm sure there are. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=863.0s)]
*  I was researching Jews in Iran and I was actually surprised to see that there are about 9000 Iranian Jews and they participate in society normally and have a guaranteed minority parliamentary seat. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=865.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=873.0s)]
*  Nothing about what we're taught about Iran. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=874.0s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=876.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=877.0s)]
*  And it's really funny because the Jewish the Jewish Iranian parliamentarian literally came out and was like, Iran has a right to defend itself. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=878.0s)]
*  That was like one of the first statements that came from the Iranian government was like the Jewish member of the parliament being like, the fuck are you guys doing? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=892.0s)]
*  Iran Iran has a right to defend itself. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=901.0s)]
*  Was this IOU 44 billion BB? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=904.0s)]
*  I can't tell what this is. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=908.0s)]
*  The whole fuck you USA motto Iran has going on it. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=910.0s)]
*  So there are people don't get fooled like other Arab nations. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=914.0s)]
*  I think in America, some type of good guy that will save you one day. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=916.0s)]
*  I mean, I think Iran is no by and large that America will not save them. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=919.0s)]
*  Isfahan's Jewish community condemns Israeli strikes backs Iranian response. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=926.0s)]
*  The Jewish community in Isfahan condemned the Israeli attacks on Iran describing it as a brutal act of de v. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=930.0s)]
*  Brutal act of human decency that led to killing of innocent civilians among them children. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=935.0s)]
*  I'm I'm I'm very certain. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=940.0s)]
*  Please stop sending me fucking hope core shit. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=943.0s)]
*  Let's infantilize Iran law. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=945.0s)]
*  What? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=948.0s)]
*  Let me fail. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=949.0s)]
*  Let's have the great Satan overthrow our government. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=951.0s)]
*  Let's infantilize Iran. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=953.0s)]
*  What is this infantilization of Iran? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=954.0s)]
*  They were given a safe voting location and campaign opportunity to talk to candidates and was spunked by VOA in the U.N. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=956.0s)]
*  is deeply dangerous and discriminatory. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=961.0s)]
*  But when that happens in the U.S. is a good thing. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=963.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=965.0s)]
*  The parliament of Iran's Jewish MP home I am some said he supports Iran's right to legitimate self-defense against Israel urging [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=966.0s)]
*  throughout the past few years that Iran must have a strong response to Israeli aggression anyway. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=973.0s)]
*  Let's get back to this. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=978.0s)]
*  Kit mar here at CNN. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=981.0s)]
*  Excellent line of questioning from her really pressing the president on this. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=984.0s)]
*  I think the most notable things are exactly what you said. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=989.0s)]
*  One is that he admitted we've seen some of this reporting that Iranian intermediaries had reached out to the U.S. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=992.0s)]
*  and an attempt and saying that they wanted de-escalation. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=1000.0s)]
*  He said yes they do. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=1003.0s)]
*  He said they should have tried to come to the table and talk to us sooner. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=1005.0s)]
*  He brought up that 60 day deadline that he had sent a couple months ago in a letter to the Iranians saying that they had 60 days to negotiate with the United States a potential nuclear deal. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=1008.0s)]
*  He said they should have talked before that deadline was up. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=1019.0s)]
*  We had reported that that deadline was last Thursday when we started to see the strikes from Israel. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=1022.0s)]
*  He also was pressed by our colleague about what would it take for the United States to offer more than just defensive and intelligence aid to the Israelis. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=1027.0s)]
*  He said he didn't want to talk about it. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=1037.0s)]
*  He didn't want to talk about military aid. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=1039.0s)]
*  Very notable from a president who often answers every single question and likes to be honest and transparent with the media. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=1041.0s)]
*  It was clear that he did not want to go there. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=1047.0s)]
*  All of this comes, Zayn and Biana, after we have a little bit of a break. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUFYQL4knc4&t=1049.0s)]
