*  Despite a 2019 court order that he would be persecuted there and barring his deportation [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTSTlS3DyrE&t=172.28s)]
*  The plaintiff should not have been removed that is not in dispute the government's attorney said in a stunning admission and later when the judge [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTSTlS3DyrE&t=178.04s)]
*  Asked on what basis is he held? Why is he? Yeah? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTSTlS3DyrE&t=185.94s)]
*  What's crazy about it is that the government out of all? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTSTlS3DyrE&t=190.48s)]

*  She found that the government's arguments that she was powerless to order him brought back to the United States were without legal merit [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTSTlS3DyrE&t=241.4s)]
*  And she found that he was suffering irreparable harm with every day that goes by while he's separated from his family [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTSTlS3DyrE&t=249.32s)]
