# The Camera Issue Has Been Fixed | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo)
*  Chat has no idea about video 4k coming in is better for downscaling and anti aliasing. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=0.0s)]
*  He has less compression artifacting etc. Get a clue. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=4.48s)]
*  No, I know that and that's why I wanted to do it. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=8.48s)]
*  But the problem was that these cameras are great for filming 4k footage to an SD card. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  I'm going to fix basically yesterday's issues with the camera. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=19.12s)]
*  We figured it out. It's because Lumix cameras [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=34.400000000000006s)]
*  for all intents and purposes. Hold on. I'm going to change some stuff around here a little bit. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=38.8s)]
*  Lumix cameras for all intents and purposes. Unfortunately, are not very good at. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=44.56s)]
*  I mean, they're very good at broadcasting 4k or not broadcasting. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=53.68000000000001s)]
*  They're very good at filming 4k footage. They're not necessarily very good at [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=57.84s)]
*  live broadcasting 4k footage. Like there's a difference between being able to film 4k footage [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=63.36s)]
*  onto your memory stick. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=68.32000000000001s)]
*  Okay, I'll wait as I know you'll cover it. But how did you feel about the Slate article for [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=72.8s)]
*  your Hassan diehards? What? What do you mean? What does that even mean? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=76.56s)]
*  That was a profile done with my knowledge. So yeah, I liked it. I mean, there's a couple parts [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  of it that I didn't fully agree with. But you know, there's always going to be some editorial [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=89.84s)]
*  control that I don't, you know, but yeah, it's a great article and we'll take a look at it later. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=94.8s)]
*  Curious. Have you seen the video of the plane flipping at the actual crash itself? Yes. I also [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=99.92s)]
*  talked to my I talked to my professional plane correspondent. Anyway, here's the thing. Here's [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=103.84s)]
*  the problem with the Lumix cameras. And it's the same problem with the Sony cameras as well. I have [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=110.16s)]
*  long been obsessed with the idea of being able to offer you like 4k footage. Okay, it's it's like [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=116.56s)]
*  one of the nerdiest parts of I guess my brain. Hi, hello, new cams, great cameras, but you [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=124.56s)]
*  definitely want something better for streaming. What are you talking about? There is nothing [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=131.12s)]
*  better for streaming. This image that you're seeing, the clarity of this image that you're [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=135.12s)]
*  getting is quite literally the highest level of clarity that you're going to get. I wanted to go [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=140.56s)]
*  beyond that. I wanted to because if you stream here, I'm going to give you guys some nerd shit. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=145.36s)]
*  Okay, if I had these cameras tweaked at 4k, the SDI cable and the HDMI on those cameras [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=152.16s)]
*  are not actually created specifically for clarity of vision in real time broadcasting. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=160.56s)]
*  It's not these cameras are not designed for live streaming. Many cameras are not no none of the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=167.51999999999998s)]
*  professional cameras are actually designed for live streaming. They're actually designed for [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=172.72s)]
*  filming. So when you film things, it's different, right? They're designed, their internal [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=177.44s)]
*  mechanisms, their machines are designed to basically give you the best possible footage [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=184.56s)]
*  available in the format of an SD card. Okay, that's it. They need to be tweaked a bit. No, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=190.24s)]
*  they can't be tweaked. This is it. This is most of the most of the cameras that streamers use, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=197.44s)]
*  whether it be the Lumix cameras that I have here, or whether it's the Sony FX that I use [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=204.16s)]
*  when I'm live streaming, those cameras are all still very much created with the purpose of [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=208.8s)]
*  filming things, not live broadcasting things. Because when you live broadcast things, the image [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=214.8s)]
*  quality suffers or rather there is a level of latency. Okay, there's latency because the SDI [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=222.16000000000003s)]
*  input or the HDMI, the HDMI and SDI outputs are specifically designed for like mini monitors that [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=233.04s)]
*  you can watch in real time. They're not designed for the final product. The final product is still [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=240.8s)]
*  going to be in the SD it's going to be not choppy, it's going to give you the perfect vision [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=246.72s)]
*  perfectly crisp. So my issue was I my issue was I was trying to force the Lumix cameras to [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=250.64000000000001s)]
*  feed 4k footage even though we can't technically broadcast in 4k anyway on twitch. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=260.88s)]
*  Even when you get exceptions, I think there's like exemptions that twitch gives to people. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=265.92s)]
*  But even then most people don't broadcast in true 4k anyway, but it doesn't really matter because [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=269.84s)]
*  if you're still streaming in 4k camera, if you're streaming with a 4k camera, okay, and the footage [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=275.04s)]
*  that you're feeding into a 1080p output is still 4k, it's still going to have higher quality. Right, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=282.08s)]
*  so basically, I just wanted to give you higher quality even if you downscale 4k from 1080p, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=288.64s)]
*  it will look better than just straight up 1080p. Yes, but that's what I did. I downscaled 4k from [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=294.4s)]
*  1080p and it was going to look better than 1080p, which it did. However, it still it basically [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=299.84s)]
*  didn't matter because the latency was too high. And therefore, you were seeing a lot of lag, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=307.68s)]
*  there was a lot of lag from the camera on to the broadcast by the time we got to the broadcast. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=314.32s)]
*  That's it. It's just nerd shit. I just wanted to make it like, I just wanted to make it not just [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=322.64s)]
*  so that the quality was high, but also the quality was high for my editors, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=329.12s)]
*  like for the Hasanabi Eclipse Industrial Complex editors, for the Hasanabi TikTok [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=334.15999999999997s)]
*  Industrial Complex editors, because when I go down to the corner, when I go down to the corner of my [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=338.4s)]
*  screen, if it's at least like higher quality footage, you can still zoom in on it without [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=345.2s)]
*  suffering too much in terms of quality. That was my goal. And while that was my goal, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=351.28s)]
*  this is still good enough. Okay. This is still good enough. You feed the AV nerds in your [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=356.23999999999995s)]
*  audience so good and they still complain. Yeah. And it seems it seems that this is an issue that [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=362.64s)]
*  everyone is aware of because and it's not like that big of a problem because most people are [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=370.32s)]
*  perfectly fine with either one live streaming from 1080p because most platforms don't even [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=375.76s)]
*  have 4k accessibility anyway. So it doesn't matter. Does that make sense? Do you understand? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=383.28s)]
*  Hopefully that was helpful for all of you. Chad has no idea about video 4k coming in is better [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=390.48s)]
*  for downscaling and anti-aliasing. He has less compression artifacting, etc. Get a clue. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=395.6s)]
*  No, I know that and that's why I wanted to do it. But the problem was that these cameras are great [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=401.28000000000003s)]
*  for filming 4k footage to an SD card, but they're not great for live broadcasting 4k footage. Okay. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=408.24s)]
*  And that's the reason why you were watching the screen like experience frame drops and tears. It [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=417.36s)]
*  sometimes felt like it sometimes basically felt like I was question for research. Which stream did [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=423.44s)]
*  this come from? I don't know. Hold on. Bro. The quality is great. Can you please stop explaining [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=430.08000000000004s)]
*  the stream and stop pandering? No, I will not. I will continue pandering. I guess it's called [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=436.8s)]
*  considered pandering now. But the reason why I'm explaining this is because this is what I did. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=443.76s)]
*  You asked me what the personal news is. This is what I did last night. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=450.0s)]
*  This is what the Hasanabegaming team did last night. Okay. Working on that. But I also have [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=454.4s)]
*  another announcement. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqRDvCHCLo&t=460.08s)]
