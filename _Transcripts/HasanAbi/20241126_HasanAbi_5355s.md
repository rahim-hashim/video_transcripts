*  And I told you he was going to be to win favors. That's it. It's that. And also to maybe in the [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=513.52s)]
*  future, gut what remains of the income tax. I mean, borders are Tom Homan is now warning [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=519.12s)]
*  those migrants. They will soon face harsher policies like family separation. We got to enforce [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=525.36s)]
*  immigration law or we're never going to fix the border and at least a big national security [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=531.28s)]
*  vulnerability to this nation. Later today, Homan will meet with Texas is Republican governor, Greg [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=535.52s)]
*  Abbott, as he prepares for his sweeping crackdown. If enacted, these tariffs could violate the terms [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=540.32s)]
*  of the trade agreement between the U S Mexico and Canada. He signed by the way, he didn't have the [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=546.96s)]
*  two and then now saying f**k that. Which Trump signed into law during his first term. Trump also [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=552.8000000000001s)]

*  all Chinese products too. Tariffs are a favorite tool of Trump's. To me, the most beautiful word [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=566.1600000000001s)]
*  in the dictionary is tariff and it's my favorite word. Trump's comments drawing responses from trade [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=572.4000000000001s)]
*  partners. The Chinese embassy saying economic and trade cooperation is essentially mutually [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=578.72s)]
*  beneficial. No one will win in a trade war or a tariff war and Canada responding saying they'll [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=584.1600000000001s)]
*  continue to discuss these issues with the incoming administration. Trump used tariffs as a negotiating [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=590.8000000000001s)]
*  tactic during his first term, so he's reusing that playbook again. But if he actually follows [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=596.32s)]
*  through on his campaign, bow for higher tariffs, some economists estimate that could cost the [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=601.52s)]
*  average U.S. Household more than $2,600 a year. George really drive inflation. Okay, Selena, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=606.16s)]

*  we're hearing from the incoming Trump administration about how they plan to crack down on the border [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=618.88s)]
*  and carry out these mass deportations? Well, very sternly, as a matter of fact, Mexico's president [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=622.96s)]

*  tariffs on Mexico, actually. But Jim, as you know, all of these things are intermingled. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=635.12s)]
*  The Mexico's president was very firm. She called out President-elect Donald Trump saying that both [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=640.64s)]
*  Mexico and the United States collaborate on a lot of different levels, including economically. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=646.9599999999999s)]
*  And in other words, she said that she's ready to respond in kind. Let me read to you a portion of [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=653.52s)]
*  that letter that she sent to President-elect Donald Trump. She said, quote, President Trump, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=660.0799999999999s)]
*  neither threats nor tariffs will solve the issue of migration or drug consumption in the United [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=665.04s)]
*  States. Cooperation and shared understandings are required to face these important challenges. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=671.6s)]
*  Imposing one tariff would mean another comes in response. I'm going to read that one more time [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=678.24s)]
*  because these are very important words from Mexico's president. Imposing one tariff would mean [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=684.64s)]
*  another comes in response, continuing like this until we put shared companies at risk. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=690.64s)]
*  Now, the tone of this letter is very important because the Mexican president is not just talking about [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=698.24s)]
*  my goat, my goat, cloud the my goat cloud the conservative Reddit claims to the Trump [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=703.6s)]
*  negotiation tactic that is in the art of the deal book. And that he's hitting the, he's hitting [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=710.4s)]
*  the, with the highest possible deal from them to squirm and take action. And he will lower the [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=715.28s)]
*  tariffs. Once they do who's going to take action, tariffs do not end up. Tariffs are not a cost that [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=719.36s)]
*  the Chinese government has to pay. And there are certain raw materials, for example, that [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=727.44s)]
*  companies need. There is a lot of shit that is not either refined here, or there's a lot of shit that [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=734.8000000000001s)]
*  isn't just here. Like, what are you going to do? You can't materialize things that don't exist within [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=741.36s)]
*  the boundaries of the United States of America. If the streamlined process for a lot of these [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=745.7600000000001s)]
*  raw materials are already within the supply chain coming from these countries that you're hitting [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=752.1600000000001s)]
*  them with tariffs. And we have no competitive manufacturing industry. Then what are you supposed [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=758.96s)]
*  to do? Sometimes we do have the like tomatoes, avocados, things like that bananas, you know what [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=766.0s)]
*  I mean? Well, with bananas, there's not really a substitute, but like tomatoes and avocados, you [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=774.72s)]
*  can make it here. Right? You do make it here, right? You grow them here, but not by the numbers [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=779.36s)]
*  necessary. So what are you supposed to do? What are you supposed to do? We get it from Mexico. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=785.6800000000001s)]
*  What are you supposed to do? Trump is doing degrowth, dude. That's what he's doing. Like [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=790.96s)]
*  people are still what's going to end up happening is, is people are still going to keep, you know, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=796.32s)]
*  importing this stuff. And then they're going to pay the tariffs. And then they're going to carry [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=802.16s)]
*  on the cost of the consumer. That's it. So the prices are going to go up because now the production [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=807.2s)]
*  costs have gone up. It's that simple. Like people understand this when they talk about labor. Oh, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=813.5200000000001s)]
*  when the wages go up, well, then the cost of the, the cost of production is going to go up. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=818.6400000000001s)]
*  No company is going to eat the fucking profit margins. Okay. They're just not going to do that. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=824.8000000000001s)]
*  This is a way for Donald Trump to, I don't think he's going to do like full blown tariffs. I think [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=829.6800000000001s)]
*  he's just going to pair of key sectors. And then, you know, and then use that as a mechanism to, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=834.64s)]
*  to bring in more alliances from industry leaders to be like, I will tear off your business in the [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=841.84s)]
*  ground unless you play ball companies need to be able to eat the upfront cost though. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=848.8s)]
*  Okay. If companies were going to eat the upfront costs, why don't they do that for [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=853.4399999999999s)]
*  wage increases rather than putting tariffs on random shit that then goes in the pockets of the [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=858.4s)]
*  American government. So they can fucking not, you know, fix the potholes and instead give it to [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=865.52s)]
*  Israel. The fuck force the companies to eat the profits, eat into their profit margins and increase [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=870.48s)]
*  wages then tariffs about economic and the economic relationship with the so the border relationship [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=876.56s)]
*  with the United States because Mexico has done a lot to help the Biden administration control the [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=884.32s)]
*  migration that is coming into the U S southern border, which begs the question about what is [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=890.88s)]
*  happening on the U S southern border, given that governor Greg Abbott and the incoming U S border [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=897.12s)]
*  czar, Tom Homan are on the border today. Here's the reality. The migrant apprehension numbers are [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=902.64s)]
*  extremely low. I talked to a law enforcement source Jim, who says that on Sunday migrant [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=909.2800000000001s)]
*  apprehensions were about 1500. If you compare that to December of 2023, when 10,000 people were [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=915.36s)]
*  crossing the border per day, that just gives you a sense of the dramatic change. The reality is, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=920.48s)]
*  and I've talked to both people on the ground agents and also advocates who work on the border. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=926.1600000000001s)]
*  They say it is very quiet right now, very low, despite what you're hearing from governor Greg [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=931.9200000000001s)]
*  Abbott and the incoming border czar Tom Homan back to you. All right, Rosa Flores, important [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=937.28s)]
*  context. Thank you very much. What do Americans want in terms of what are their top priorities [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=942.64s)]
*  for Trump? This is according to news CBS News, you go pull that came out. Their highest priority is [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=947.4399999999999s)]
*  lower prices. 79% of Americans want higher lower prices. Just 26% say put tariffs on import. So his [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=952.64s)]
*  strategy here can undercut what voters want him to do. Sure. But this, you know, threatening [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=963.12s)]
*  tariffs. Dear president, like Donald Trump, I'm writing to you regarding your statement on Monday, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=969.44s)]
*  November 25 concerning migration, federal trafficking and tariffs. You may not be aware [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=973.44s)]
*  that Mexico has developed a comprehensive policy. This is migrants from different parts of the world [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=977.44s)]
*  who would cross our territory on route to the southern border of the United States. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=980.88s)]
*  As a result, and according to data from your country's customs and border protection, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=984.32s)]
*  encounters of the Mexico United States borders have decreased 75% between December 2023 and [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=988.0s)]
*  November 2024. Moreover, half of those who arrive do so through a legally scheduled appointment [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=993.04s)]
*  under the United States CBP one program. For these reasons, migrant caravans no longer arrive at the [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=998.48s)]
*  border. Even so, it is clear that we must work together to create a new labor mobility model [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1003.4399999999999s)]
*  that is necessary for your country as well as address the root causes that compel families to [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1008.16s)]
*  leave their homes out of necessity. If even a small percentage of what the United States allocates to [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1012.16s)]
*  war were instead dedicated to building peace and fostering development, it would address the [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1016.56s)]
*  underlying causes of human mobility. On another note, and for based on another note, and for [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1021.6s)]
*  humanitarian reasons, Mexico's consistently expressed is willingness to help prevent the [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1027.1200000000001s)]
*  fentanyl epidemic in the United States from continuing. This is after all a public health [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1031.28s)]
*  consumption problem within your society. Yeah. She's saying like you Americans are fat fentanyl [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1035.2s)]
*  addicts and it's not our fault. You have created the market for a fentanyl. So far this year, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1041.04s)]
*  Mexican armed forces and prosecutors have seized tons of various types of drugs, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1047.12s)]
*  10,000 firearms and detained 15,000 individuals for violence related to drug trafficking. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1050.8799999999999s)]
*  Furthermore, the Mexican Congress is in the process of approving a constitutional reform [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1056.4799999999998s)]
*  to classify the production, distribution and commercialization of fentanyl and other synthetic [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1060.08s)]
*  drugs as a serious crime without bail. However, it is publicly known that the chemical precursors [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1064.1599999999999s)]
*  used to produce this and other synthetic drugs are illegally entering Canada, the United States [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1068.7199999999998s)]
*  and Mexico from Asian countries. This underscores the urgent need for international collaboration. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1073.52s)]
*  You must also be aware of the illegal trafficking of firearms into my country from the United States. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1078.4s)]
*  Again, also correct. It's also ironically enough, Americans that traffic the fentanyl and chemical [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1083.44s)]
*  compounds necessary for fentanyl through regular points of entry for an American market. And then [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1089.8400000000001s)]
*  Americans also trade guns for said fentanyl and chemical compounds. So the drug trade is directly [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1096.08s)]
*  vibrant as a consequence of American ridiculous American policies. America is so gun crazy that [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1105.4399999999998s)]
*  they also have similar problems with Canada too. 70% of the illegal weapons seized from criminals [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1113.04s)]
*  in Mexico come from your country. We do not produce these weapons nor do we consume synthetic drugs. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1119.12s)]
*  Tragically, it is in our country that lives are lost in the to the violence resulting from [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1123.76s)]
*  meeting the drug demand in yours. Am I on CNN now? Are they finally covering my story on CNN? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1127.68s)]
*  Let's watch. Not yet. It's out front. I just saw you on CNN. Oh, wait, I guess we missed it then [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1134.56s)]
*  because it's Aaron Burnett out front right now. I'm up next. Okay. Hopefully I'll be able to finish [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1140.8799999999999s)]
*  this in time. President Trump migration and drug consumption in the United States cannot be addressed [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1145.44s)]
*  through threats or tariffs. What is needed is cooperation and mutual understanding to tackle [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1149.84s)]
*  these significant challenges for every tariff. There will be a response in kind until we put our [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1154.08s)]
*  put at risk our shared enterprises. Yes. Share it. For instance, among Mexico's main exporters [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1159.6799999999998s)]
*  of the United States are General Motors, Stellantis and Ford Motor Company, which arrived in Mexico 80 [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1164.48s)]
*  years ago. Why impose a tariff that would jeopardize them? Such a measure would be unacceptable and [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1169.36s)]
*  would lead to inflation and job losses in both the United States and Mexico. I am convinced that [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1174.0s)]
*  North America's economic strength lies in maintaining our trade partnership. This allows [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1178.4s)]
*  us to remain competitive amongst other economic blocks. For this reason, I believe that the [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1182.72s)]
*  dialogue is the best path to understanding peace and prosperity for our nations. I hope our teams [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1186.4s)]
*  can meet soon to build, to continue building joint resolutions. So that part is also correct. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1191.76s)]
*  And not only is that part correct, but also one of the funniest things that happened in this process [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1198.5600000000002s)]
*  was Canada also was like, what the hell's going on? Except their response was why the [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1205.52s)]
*  fuck would you ever say we're Mexican to compare the U S to Mexico is the most insulting thing I've [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1212.8799999999999s)]

*  Ford says adding their illegals entering Canada from the U S too. There's no way to treat your [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1226.08s)]

*  needs to be addressed. Or says Ontario is preparing a strong commercial in the U S that [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1233.36s)]

*  I guess no more Chinese food or whatever the fuck, but like they don't understand [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1294.24s)]
*  that there are raw materials that are necessary for American production that are being manufactured [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1300.08s)]
*  or are, you know, are coming in from these countries. Lumber, for example. Oh my God, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1306.56s)]
*  because we will only be applying tariffs to foreign products. Look, Aaron, I recognize [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1313.2s)]
*  you probably have no fucking idea how tariffs work. So let me tell you how this is going to happen. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1319.04s)]
*  We're going to put tariffs on the foreign products that Walmart brings in, which will raise the cost [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1323.3600000000001s)]
*  of the foreign products and allow the American companies to compete with them to actually be [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1328.96s)]
*  able to compete on price, thereby incentivizing people to buy American, which would lead to that [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1334.0800000000002s)]
*  American company being able to lower their prices because they're finally getting volume. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1339.92s)]
*  Therefore, what you have is foreign products, which are, Oh, that's how it was going to work. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1344.3200000000002s)]
*  Oh, American manufacturing is going to become cheaper. I didn't realize that that's how, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1349.52s)]
*  how it was going to work. Famously when there is a stable amount of demand, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1354.64s)]
*  but the supply all of a sudden is wiped out in half. What ends up happening is famously [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1361.6000000000001s)]
*  companies actually lower their prices and not increase their prices. They only increase their [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1367.6s)]
*  prices when Joe Biden is president. Thank you. No, that's how it works. They're finally getting [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1374.9599999999998s)]
*  volume. Therefore, what you have is foreign products, which are going to be significantly [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1380.48s)]
*  more expensive. Still not American products where the company is able to lower their price because [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1384.9599999999998s)]
*  they're able to sell in volume. But yeah, if you want to continue to buy, I think I'm up next on [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1389.4399999999998s)]
*  CNN. Maybe that may be in the works. Let's see. That's going to blow up some heads. So, you know, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1394.32s)]
*  we'll see. All right. This comes as Democrats right now are pinning their hopes tonight on [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1397.84s)]
*  this man, son, piker, the left's biggest influencer. In fact, seven and a half million people [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1401.52s)]
*  tuned into his live stream on election night, seven and a half million. So who is he? And is [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1407.6s)]
*  he getting young men to swing left? Donio Sullivan went and talked to him and he is out front. Donio [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1412.72s)]
*  Sullivan. This is a son, piker. This is my dog, Kaya. I thought you legitimately were going to [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1418.56s)]
*  work out. I could do some weights. He's a social media superstar with almost three million followers [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1423.76s)]
*  on the video streaming platform Twitch. They're eating the pets. So this is that whole masculinity [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1429.68s)]
*  thing people are talking about now. And he's part of a growing group of streamers and podcasters [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1437.6s)]
*  reaching young men online, a space Trump tapped into to reach young male voters. Punch in, then [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1442.72s)]
*  you won't be able to see that he's not doing any weights. But Hassan is not a Trump supporter. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1448.96s)]
*  He's a progressive, a fan of Bernie and AOC. The Democratic Party even invited him to the DNC in [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1453.76s)]
*  August. One thing we've been hearing for weeks now is that the left needs a Joe Rogan. Yeah, I [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1460.24s)]
*  don't think that the Democratic Party can podcast itself out of this issue. Joe Rogan, he endorsed [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1467.3600000000001s)]
*  Bernie Sanders in 2020. Maybe they should do an autopsy on why he left the party. Yeah, I've heard [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1474.1599999999999s)]
*  you say when it comes to stuff that guys like, you seek that stuff out online, whether it's [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1479.6799999999998s)]
*  watching a stream or whether it's watching guys talking about working out and fitness. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1485.12s)]
*  You say that the right wing just dominates. Look how tall she is. Yeah. We're on TV. Well, I think [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1489.6799999999998s)]
*  that's why I started on Twitch, right? I know for a fact that the video game space is like people who [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1495.52s)]
*  consume this culture, people who are a part of this culture are not all right wing. I wanted to [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1502.16s)]
*  showcase to people that like, no, you can be a progressive person. You can be a leftist and like [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1507.76s)]
*  have fun at the same time. How many people are watching your live stream on election night? [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1511.8400000000001s)]
*  The total unique number was 7.5 million. There's a general sense that when it comes to the world [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1517.0400000000002s)]
*  of podcasts, alternative media, I don't even know what you want to call it, that Trump did a much [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1523.28s)]
*  better job with us than Democrats and Harris. Absolutely. I think that's true. When I saw the [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1528.16s)]
*  Aidan Ross collab, I thought this is not, this doesn't have emotion. It was awkward. It was weird. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1534.24s)]
*  But then I saw Trump on Theo Vaughn and he started talking about cocaine and I was like, uh oh, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1541.76s)]
*  this, this humanizes him. Cocaine will make you. So you're way up with cocaine more than anything [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1548.88s)]
*  else you can think of. Cocaine will turn you into a damn owl, homie, you know what I'm saying? [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1554.0s)]
*  Harris did consider going on Joe Rogan. Yeah. But she didn't. What is this that the Democrat party [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1557.6799999999998s)]
*  has to do differently? Well, um, I think that they need to change their policies. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1564.48s)]
*  It's a policy thing. Yes. It's 100% policy thing. Cause I'll say, right, which is the boring answer. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1571.28s)]
*  Although it would be very self-serving for me to say I'm the left's Joe Rogan, the Democratic party [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1576.7199999999998s)]
*  should give me millions of dollars. That's not going to solve this problem. What will solve this [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1582.1599999999999s)]
*  problem is if the Democratic party actually adopts real left-wing economic populist messaging instead [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1587.52s)]
*  of purposely avoiding that stuff because they're terrified of upsetting their corporate donors. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1594.72s)]
*  I think Trump speaks to male insecurities better. And I think Trump speaks to the anger that people [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1600.56s)]
*  have, whereas the other side of the political spectrum does not speak to that anger at all. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1605.1999999999998s)]
*  There's been a lot of controversy around you. Yes. The way you talk about Israel is viewed by [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1611.12s)]
*  some as anti-Semitic. Yeah. Are you anti-Semitic? Of course not. The real problem here is that I'm [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1616.8799999999999s)]
*  an anti-Zionist. The real problem here is that I'm extremely critical of Israel and all of the [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1623.9199999999998s)]
*  information that's readily available, especially on social media for so many people that don't [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1629.6s)]
*  necessarily rely on mainstream media any longer to get their information. And that's why you see this [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1635.28s)]
*  generational gap. If you're over the age of 35, you're still on drugs. You're like, no, Israel's [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1640.32s)]
*  the most moral democracy in the Middle East, maybe in the world, right? And I think that the major [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1644.6399999999999s)]
*  generational divide that is, I think, in a very damaging way, feeding into the mistrust overall [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1651.52s)]
*  that people have with mainstream news in general is coming from that. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1658.0s)]
*  Antonio Sullivan, CNN, Los Angeles. Yeah, it's so thoughtful and important to hear that. Ken Martin [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1662.96s)]
*  is out front. He is running to be the next chair of the DNC. He's the current chairman of the [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1668.72s)]
*  Minnesota Democratic Farmer Labor Party. And I really appreciate your time, Ken. So, you know, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1672.08s)]
*  you hear Hassan Piker. Seven and a half million people watched him on an election night. He's all [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1676.4s)]
*  in as a Democrat. But then he's talking to Donnie about how the video game and fitness space online [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1681.28s)]
*  is dominated by right-wing people talking about it, right? Not necessarily everyone into fitness, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1686.72s)]
*  right? That there's that gap. And he says that Trump speaks to male insecurities better. He [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1692.64s)]
*  speaks to the anger that people have and that Democrats don't speak to that anger at all. I'm [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1697.76s)]
*  quoting Hassan here. He's very direct about the problem. Do you agree with him? [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1702.48s)]
*  Well, first off, Erin, thanks for having me on tonight. And actually, I think Hassan's right, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1707.68s)]
*  in most of what he says there, and particularly as it relates to the fact that the Republicans have [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1712.08s)]
*  been, since the 2000 election, 2020 election, a constant drumbeat of misinformation, disinformation, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1716.56s)]
*  and lies on platforms that the Democratic Party really wasn't competing in. We live in a 24 seven, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1723.12s)]
*  365 day information environment. Now that we have to be competing in, in a much better way, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1729.12s)]
*  podcasts, streaming services, Tik Tok, social media, of course, my two boys, 22 and 20, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1735.76s)]
*  they get their information from Tik Tok. Right. And so we have to start realizing that we have [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1742.32s)]
*  to be where the voters are. That's half the battle, of course. Okay. No, he's missing the point. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1747.12s)]
*  I didn't say, I didn't say just be at the podcast. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1752.08s)]
*  Others who are already trusted validators and messengers in these spaces to help push these [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1754.8799999999999s)]
*  messages out and to have conversations with voters and people who are feeling frustrated [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1760.0s)]
*  and angry and left behind. That's not what I said. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1765.84s)]
*  You see when we send people into these spaces, it tends to be politicians or talking heads. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1768.08s)]
*  That's the opposite of what I said. People like Hassan have deep influence [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1771.28s)]
*  and certainly have a voice and a following. So, you know, there has been a lot of focus, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1775.04s)]
*  and he sort of touches on that because he's talking about the dominance of right-wing voices [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1779.52s)]
*  in very male spaces like video games or fitness. And there has been, though, broadly speaking, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1784.24s)]
*  Ken, so much focus right now. And as you're looking to run the DNC, this is at the center of it. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1790.8s)]
*  I said, you're not going to podcast your way out of this problem. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1795.28s)]
*  ... aggressively away from certain social positions like DEI, right? Or from issues where [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1797.68s)]
*  Democrats certainly seem to be in this election and certainly were successfully branded as [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1803.6s)]
*  much to the left of American voters. For example, Kamala Harris's support of taxpayer-funded [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1809.92s)]
*  surgeries, transgender surgeries for illegal migrants. The Trump and Harris campaigns [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1814.56s)]
*  see the impact of that issue of that now famous ad very differently. I wanted to play each of them [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1820.16s)]
*  for you. Oh my God. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1826.0s)]
*  We targeted black men, Hispanic families. Oh my God, I'm dying. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1828.6399999999999s)]
*  White families, suburban women. We ran that ad. They did not. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1832.8s)]
*  They also got to the point about boys and girls locker rooms. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1837.28s)]
*  They're like, no, we have to find a Joe Rogan of the left and give him a million dollars. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1839.28s)]
*  That's the point. That's what we got to do. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1843.52s)]
*  Most ruthlessly effective. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1845.36s)]
*  I don't know how else I can communicate this point openly. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1847.28s)]
*  This trans ad was not driving growth. There's a belief that if only we had responded to this [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1850.8s)]
*  trans ad with national and huge battleground state ads, we would have won. I don't think that's true. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1856.32s)]
*  So Ken, how do you see it? One of the most ruthlessly effective negative ads in all of history [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1862.08s)]
*  or this trans ad was not driving the vote, even if they'd responded to it more effectively, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1866.7199999999998s)]
*  they wouldn't have won. Which point of view is right? [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1871.36s)]
*  Well, I don't know which point of view is right. What I do know is we don't have to [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1874.9599999999998s)]
*  abandon our values here. We can stand up for the oppressed and marginalized and people who are [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1878.3999999999999s)]
*  being pushed out of this conversation while also at the same time centering this conversation [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1882.8799999999999s)]

*  country these last several years. It's not about left or right to me. It's about making sure we [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1892.8s)]
*  focus squarely on a working class agenda that centers the struggles of this multiracial, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1897.44s)]
*  multigenerational working class that is feeling left behind, that's working harder [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1903.52s)]

*  damn about their lives. At the end of the day, that's the thing that unites all parts of our [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1913.12s)]
*  broad coalition in the Democratic Party. And we need to focus back on basics here, right? [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1917.6s)]
*  But at the same time, we do not need to abandon our values. We will stand up and protect and [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1923.52s)]
*  fight for people who are being pushed out of this conversation in this country and bullied and [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1928.7199999999998s)]

*  you are running to run the DNC and that decision for the Democratic Party is going to be crucial. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1942.8s)]
*  So much is at stake. So thank you for your time. And you mentioned what's going on in Congress. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1947.36s)]
*  Well, that comes down to this, the Republican Congresswoman, Nancy Mase now leading the charge [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1952.1599999999999s)]

*  trans community. This gives about face a whole new name. K-file has the tapes plus Harry Anton with [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1962.08s)]
*  Okay. CNN watches you on mute. Just like chat. Yeah. I, yeah. I mean, he, the recovery was better [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1969.3600000000001s)]

*  We're here. There are some Minnesotans that say they don't like Ken Martin in the chat immediately, [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1983.76s)]
*  but the party is to focus on again, getting back to a working class agenda that centers the struggles [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=1989.8400000000001s)]

*  them. The path forward here for the democratic. I think that was good overall. I think that [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2007.2s)]
*  the message, you know, the fact that I'm able to even say this message on CNN is, is a, [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2014.0s)]
*  is a shift in the attitude is a market shift. I think at least it weren't outright Italian [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2020.3200000000002s)]
*  you know, like I think that, I don't know, dude, you've probably been asked a million times, but [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2025.52s)]
*  what's your thoughts on the DSA? It's great. You gave them a layup and still fumbled though. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2032.72s)]
*  Donnie O'Sullivan didn't work out. No, he did. He actually did work out. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2036.8799999999999s)]
*  They really diluted your Israel critique. Don't know what you said, but it seemed clipped. Yeah. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2042.48s)]
*  They, they, they cut it short for time constraints. It's not, I don't think they were like [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2045.76s)]

*  They, the thing is like that interview was like an hour and a half long, but what is this from the [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2057.2s)]
*  river to the seas? A chant used by extremists to support the destruction of Israel is appalling. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2062.08s)]
*  The embrace. Yeah, it's fine, dude. It's every Democrat is this way. They shouldn't be, but [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2066.2400000000002s)]
*  so glad they didn't clip anything out of context. No, they wouldn't do that. They, they like Donnie [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2072.2400000000002s)]
*  would not do that chat. Come on. Overall. I think like talking about the trans stuff this much is so [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2076.96s)]
*  so silly. I don't know. I just think it's, it's so counterproductive. Like the media is not [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2083.2s)]
*  liberal media in general is not as much in the tank for the democratic party as, as, as everyone [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2090.48s)]
*  thinks they are. They do oftentimes have a tendency to push on reactionary buttons. But having said [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2097.12s)]
*  that, I think that the democratic party should be messaging on the trans issue a lot better by just [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2103.44s)]
*  being like, this is a deflection. This is a distraction. This is not actually going to help. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2109.2s)]
*  This is not actually going to help people fix the prices. You know, it's very stupid. Anyway, [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2115.04s)]
*  the primary people who will benefit from the tariffs are real estate investors, which is [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2120.56s)]
*  Trump's primary thing. So no, the people that will benefit from Trump's tariffs regime is going to be [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2123.68s)]
*  people that are what Kamala Harris has a message for you. I just have to remind you, don't you ever [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2129.04s)]
*  let anybody take your power from you. You have the same power. What the fuck is this that you [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2137.52s)]
*  did before November 5th and you have the same purpose that you did. Bro, this is a wild clip. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2144.96s)]
*  Is she drunk? What's happening? Mama was off the park, dude. God damn. And you have the same [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2152.4s)]
*  ability to engage and inspire. Don't ever let anybody or any circumstance take your power from [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2159.44s)]
*  you. Democrat party be like, we need 30 extra million dollars right now. Here's an inspiring [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2166.48s)]
*  message from Mama. You need to make videos like this, bro. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. I think like, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2171.04s)]
*  I think tariffs are, are not going to be as universal as the way people think they are. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2176.72s)]
*  And I think they're simply going to, they're simply going to be a way for Donald Trump to win [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2185.12s)]
*  favors with key industry leaders to just like bring them to his side. So here's the thing. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2190.48s)]
*  This is something that added on did as well. Like this is something that happens in other countries, [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2196.32s)]
*  not so much in America because like America is so capitalist that there is not like a need [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2202.7200000000003s)]
*  to, to rock the boat too much and like offer too much power to like, to an administration. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2208.2400000000002s)]
*  But like in Turkey, the incoming administration brings their own wealthy class with them. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2214.4s)]
*  And it's a line of, it's a, it's a line of defense. That's what I did. He brought forth [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2219.76s)]
*  directly his family members and also people that were invested in his continued leadership. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2224.56s)]
*  And he made them incredibly wealthy. This is a, this is a part of how kleptocracies work. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2231.2s)]
*  Vladimir Putin did this in Russia and added on did this in Turkey. Okay. Turkey. I think that [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2235.52s)]
*  this is what Donald Trump is trying to do not to get all lived up on this, but like, I think this [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2242.64s)]
*  is basically what Trump is going to try to do. He's going to be like, listen, you're a billionaire. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2247.04s)]
*  You own a newspaper, right? Yeltsin did it not Putin. Okay. I'm just saying like Putin utilized [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2253.76s)]
*  the existing structure of the oligarchs to his advantage in the same way. And I think that that [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2259.04s)]
*  is what I think that is what Trump is going to try and do. And it's actually a little bit unique [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2263.84s)]
*  to the regular order of business in America because corporations run the country rather than [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2270.6400000000003s)]
*  the country runs. The government runs the corporations. And I think Trump will basically [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2276.8s)]
*  implement a tariffs regime on those he has declared enemies of his administration in an effort to [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2283.92s)]
*  centralize power even further. And, and you know, this is, this is a fantastic approach to, [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2292.0s)]
*  to moving towards more and more authoritarian mechanisms of control. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2299.36s)]
*  The heart of the Donald Trump economic plan. We should talk about the chicken war. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2304.88s)]
*  The chicken war is a clock and good story. In post-World War II West Germany, people started [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2309.76s)]
*  eating a lot of chicken, specifically American chicken. Midway through 1962, U.S. farmers were [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2314.56s)]
*  on track to sell more than $50 million worth, half a billion in today's money. This made European [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2321.68s)]
*  farmers mad. So the organization that later became the European Union put a tariff on chicken. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2328.4s)]
*  A five pound chicken that started as a $1.60 became $2.25. Imports quickly dropped. U.S. chicken [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2334.48s)]
*  farmers and politicians were furious. And we thought Germany's our big market for chicken. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2341.92s)]
*  And so if we hurt the Germans, maybe we'll get them to change their mind on chicken. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2346.96s)]
*  So the U.S. put a 25% tariff on trucks like Germany's Volkswagen. And it worked. Their truck [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2350.8s)]
*  sells in the U.S. It's interesting that Wall Street Journal, a right-wing publisher, goes ahead [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2358.0s)]
*  shitting on tariffs. Brother tariffs were the first reason why. What's the Carl Icahn left [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2361.92s)]
*  the Trump administration last time when he implemented tariffs on steel. Carl Icahn was [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2367.44s)]
*  like, what the fuck are you doing? You're like ruining key sectors of the economy. And he did. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2372.48s)]
*  He truly disrupted a lot of different parts of the, of the American economy this way. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2377.36s)]
*  So yeah, there's a reason why Wall Street Journal and damn near every economist is going to fucking [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2382.88s)]
*  be aggro on this shit. The only problem is in this process, like I'm not even anti-tariff in [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2388.0s)]
*  general. I am simply anti-tariff when it comes to just unconditional across the board tariffs [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2395.36s)]
*  with no acceptable domestic manufacturing substitute. That's why you're not going to get, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2402.96s)]
*  that's why you're not going to get liberal institutions that are still, you know, right-wing [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2408.56s)]
*  conservative, but like pro-capitalist to be on board with tariffs in general. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2412.16s)]
*  ...fell by half and they never really recovered. Meanwhile, Germans paid more for their chicken [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2416.24s)]
*  and Americans had fewer truck options. Like one of the things that I'm incredibly [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2422.16s)]
*  annoyed by with like Toyota Hilux tariffs, for example, like the Japanese competitive [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2425.9199999999996s)]
*  car manufacturing industry is that I hate that there is no acceptable small substitute, like [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2433.7599999999998s)]
*  small truck with the same cab size substitute in America. Then it's a lose-lose for everybody. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2440.24s)]
*  Right? Like I understand the, the importance of American manufacturing. I really do, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2447.44s)]
*  especially when it comes to vehicle manufacturing. The issue on the other hand is that due to cafe [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2453.8399999999997s)]
*  standards, like all of our domestic car manufacturers have realized that, you know, you can have these [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2461.2799999999997s)]
*  behemoth vehicles that are larger and larger that are basically child mutilators. And there is no end [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2468.0s)]
*  in sight for, there's no change in that. Not to change the subject, but people are very upset for [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2476.72s)]
*  you not getting in the tub of your goal weight of 225. I don't know what you're talking about. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2481.6s)]
*  No one is upset. It's kind of a perfect example of what tariffs do hurt consumers while protecting [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2486.0s)]
*  very specific industries or attempt to get countries to change their behavior. While they [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2492.56s)]
*  haven't been a large part of trade policy in decades, former president Donald Trump wants to [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2497.76s)]
*  change that. Some might say it's economic nationalism. I call it common sense. I call it America first. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2502.5600000000004s)]
*  President Trump has really sort of brought a lot of people out to think that tariffs might be [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2510.2400000000002s)]
*  something that's useful in America's economic arsenal in a way that hasn't been used in the past. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2514.4s)]
*  Here's how tariffs work and what Trump's proposals would do. Let's start in 2018 when [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2520.2400000000002s)]
*  President Trump put tariffs on washing machines. We're going to benefit our consumers and we're [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2525.52s)]
*  going to create a lot of jobs. Since then, whenever a washing machine is imported to the U.S., [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2530.72s)]
*  the company on the U.S. side doing the importing pays a tariff to the U.S. government. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2535.6s)]
*  Their margins are pretty low. They've got to pass that price on to consumers who ultimately pay it. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2540.96s)]
*  That's the whole point in some sense to reduce demand for those goods and create space for [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2545.44s)]
*  domestic producers. After the tariffs, not only did the price of imported washing machines go up, [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2549.36s)]
*  so did the ones made in the U.S. There's this myth out there that if we... Huh, [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2554.88s)]
*  wait a minute, but this guy said, hold on, but this dumbass said that it wouldn't happen, [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2560.6400000000003s)]
*  that it would be cheaper. So I'm confused. Wait, wait a minute. What? Wait a minute. What is, [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2565.6s)]
*  why, what are you saying? Tax imports, domestic producers won't change their prices. And that's [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2574.08s)]
*  not the case. You're creating more demand for them. So naturally the price goes up. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2579.84s)]
*  And it wasn't just washers. Dryers went up in price too, even though they weren't part of the [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2585.44s)]
*  tariffs. Usually it's the case if you buy a washer, you buy a dryer. So even though dryers [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2590.48s)]
*  weren't directly affected by the tariff. What? It seems like corporations, no matter whatever [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2595.1200000000003s)]
*  the restrictions are, will always increase prices. I just, I'm so... Man, man, what? [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2600.4s)]
*  Now, it wasn't all bad. These tariffs did... Create a lot of jobs. About 1800, mostly from [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2609.84s)]
*  those foreign companies like Samsung and LG opening plants in the U.S. And a study found the [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2617.6000000000004s)]
*  U.S. collected $82 million annually. But because of those price increases, it cost consumers $1.5 [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2623.36s)]
*  billion more. So they basically paid $815,000 per job. This is a... No, that sounds, [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2630.88s)]
*  that sounds sick. Aren't you a socialist? This should be good. Oh my God. Brother, there's [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2638.7200000000003s)]
*  problems here with this argument that even Wall Street Journal recognizes. And I'm shocked that [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2643.92s)]
*  you don't. Which is there needs to be one, a competitive domestic manufacturing capability, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2650.0s)]
*  and two, a restriction on increasing prices in order to make up for the additional costs [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2656.72s)]
*  that now importers are carrying on to the consumer. If those two things don't happen, [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2668.72s)]
*  then you're fucked. Tariffs just operate as a regressive tax, a sales tax, a flat sales tax. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2675.2s)]
*  Tariffs equals socialism. Trump isn't doing economic protectionism. So nationalization is [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2683.04s)]
*  the best thing to do. I mean, I didn't even say that, but I do believe that. Yes, I think that [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2688.16s)]
*  nationalization would be significantly better for a lot of sectors. Yes. Very expensive. Starting [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2693.68s)]
*  with our energy extraction industry, for sure. And so job creation program. And so that's one, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2699.12s)]
*  another reason why economists don't like tariffs. They're much more cost effective, more efficient [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2706.08s)]
*  ways of increasing employment in those industries. These weren't the only tariffs Trump created in [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2711.68s)]
*  2018. The big ones were on steel and aluminum. Those are really designed to constantly always [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2717.04s)]
*  be passed on. Prices will not be reduced when import competitors are figuratively eliminated [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2722.8799999999997s)]
*  from the marketplace. Why would a company offer a cheaper price when they own the market? Yeah, [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2726.16s)]
*  that's why I'm saying without actual pricing restrictions implemented by the federal government [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2730.16s)]
*  in any capacity, all this will do is raise prices regardless. Especially if you're doing [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2737.04s)]
*  broad sweeping tariffs. Like this isn't, this is just one good being, one good being imported. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2742.64s)]
*  Okay. It's one good being imported. And even then it still has this kind of impact. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2749.84s)]
*  Punish China for its transgressions of international trade rules. Also for national [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2755.92s)]
*  security. They're used to make a lot of military equipment, but also everyday things like [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2761.68s)]
*  cars. All the industries that use steel and have to pay the higher price, that squeezes their profit [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2766.8s)]
*  margins and also puts them at a competitive disadvantage against foreign producers of those [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2772.32s)]
*  same goods who don't have to pay those inflated costs for their inputs. And so a lot of studies [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2776.96s)]
*  have shown that you lose jobs, as many, if not more jobs in those downstream industries as you [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2782.8s)]
*  gain in the upstream industries that are being protected by the tariffs. Many studies on the [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2788.8s)]
*  2018 tariffs found some pros, some cons. Manufacturing jobs, which were on the decline, [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2792.96s)]
*  didn't increase, but they did level out. The overall economy lost jobs, mostly in those [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2798.32s)]
*  downstream industries. And the costs of the tariffs were passed on to US companies and consumers. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2803.6s)]
*  So not great for the economy, but it did motivate you. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2809.76s)]
*  I imagine you'll still live comfortably even if the prices come up. Yeah, except it doesn't matter [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2813.6800000000003s)]
*  because I'm not a selfish fucking asshole. Do you not understand? Literally every single thing that [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2818.4s)]
*  I advocate for does not impact me. I'm not a trans person, but I advocate for trans rights. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2823.52s)]
*  Okay. I'm not an undocumented immigrant, but I believe that we have to have a more just and [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2828.96s)]
*  equitable process for people that are migrating into the country. What the fuck? I have the [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2834.7200000000003s)]
*  capacity to not only have empathy, but beyond that, even in a self-serving manner, understand [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2840.32s)]
*  that if we actually fix some of these underlying material inequalities, then America will thrive. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2846.88s)]
*  Okay. Then America can lead, America can match its potential as the wealthiest nation on the fucking [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2854.2400000000002s)]
*  planet. That's it. That's it. That's the whole point. US companies to move out of China and made [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2860.1600000000003s)]
*  supply chains more resilient, but it didn't change much of China's behavior. And in many ways, they [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2866.2400000000002s)]
*  became more aggressive. But here's the thing. Even with all the economic downsides, a review by the [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2871.44s)]
*  Biden administration suggested Trump's tariffs should remain and the administration should add [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2877.6s)]
*  or increase them, which they did. Once tariffs get in place, there are two factors that sort of keep [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2883.2000000000003s)]
*  them in place for some time. First of all, there are going to be domestic interest groups that have [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2889.6s)]
*  a stake in seeing those tariffs maintained because they like the extra market share that they've [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2893.44s)]
*  gained as a result of those tariffs. And second of all, tariffs are a bargaining chip. So why would [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2897.84s)]
*  we sort of unilaterally get rid of these, even if there's some economic benefits, when we might use [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2902.88s)]
*  it in some negotiations down the road? Tariffs are really hard to remove. It's why 60 years later, [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2908.32s)]
*  there's still a 25% tariff on trucks, even though US chicken farmers no longer care about selling in [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2914.48s)]
*  Europe. So we're still living with the legacy of the chicken war. So that's sort of another lesson [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2920.96s)]
*  of history is you have to be careful about imposing these tariffs because you think you're [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2925.36s)]
*  doing it for short term strategic reasons or just helping out this industry temporarily, [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2929.76s)]
*  but they can last for decade upon decade upon decade. Tariff policy is kind of old. Even by the [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2934.1600000000003s)]
*  chicken war, they were only imposed on around 7% of US imports. Trump's plan for a second term is [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2940.48s)]
*  to bring them back dramatically. This is the policy that built this country and this is the [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2946.56s)]
*  also there's no point. There's never been a point in American history, as far as I know, [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2952.0s)]
*  and maybe I'm wrong. Someone can correct me on this, where tariffs have been implemented across [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2956.6400000000003s)]
*  the board on 40% of all trade 45 to be exact, China, Canada, and Mexico make up 45% of all trade in [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2961.84s)]
*  the United States. But can't there's also weakened international rivals of America trades with his [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2971.84s)]
*  allies instead of the same stuff, even without domestic manufacturing, dude, this is literally [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2975.6000000000004s)]
*  to fucking cut off your nose to spite your face. Okay, you're just describing that as a as a [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2979.68s)]
*  successful policy. You're also talking about Canada and Mexico as international rivals. These [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2985.68s)]
*  are two of America's most important trade partners. What are you saying? Do you hear the words that [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2992.48s)]
*  are coming out of your mouth? Do you you just type shit into the abyss and hit enter without [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=2997.8399999999997s)]
*  thinking the policy that will save our country. He's proposing a 60% tariff on everything from [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3002.96s)]
*  China and a 10 or even 20% on every import from every other country. Countries are going to finally [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3010.32s)]
*  after 75 years pay us back for all that we've done for the world. Multiple independent studies [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3016.7200000000003s)]
*  looked at the possible. Yeah, he means like, dude, I'm I'm only listening to JD pond on when he says [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3022.88s)]
*  this. I'm thinking about it as like retaliatory. He's saying that like, he's saying that the [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3029.6s)]
*  countries will finally pay us back for all the war and the death and the destruction and the unequal [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3035.6s)]
*  exchange that we have implemented as we have relegated the global south into servile status [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3040.96s)]
*  as we have routinely kept them down. They are coming back and they will fight back hard and [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3048.64s)]
*  they will destroy our treats economy. That's what he's saying. I swear he's like, they're going to [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3054.48s)]
*  pay us all back. Do you think this is just a way of disingenuously introducing a massively regressive [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3060.16s)]
*  tax? Yes, I do think that. And I also think that he will utilize this. I don't think he will do it [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3064.88s)]
*  across the board. I don't think he's doing this across the board. Anyway, he's claiming to do it [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3069.76s)]
*  across the board. I'd be shocked if he did it. I think he's doing it to, to bring American corporate [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3074.2400000000002s)]
*  owners like industry leaders to heel, to come and kiss the ring, I think. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3080.56s)]
*  One found it would cost the average American household $1,700 from higher prices. Another [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3086.4s)]
*  found it could cost more than 684,000 jobs. And they don't factor in how domestic goods might get [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3091.92s)]
*  more expensive or retaliatory tariffs from other countries. They're not going to take that this [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3098.48s)]
*  lying down. They're not going to change their behavior in some way to appease the administration [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3103.44s)]
*  that post it imposes such tariffs. The dutyable tariff rate peak of 1932 is 59.1% second only to [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3108.16s)]
*  the 61.7% rate of 1830. Okay. So the last time was a hundred years ago where we did not have the same, [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3115.2799999999997s)]
*  we did not have the same logistical international supply chains that we had created that we now [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3125.04s)]
*  desperately rely on. That's crazy. Yeah. Another key, another key problem there, of course, is [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3132.32s)]
*  yeah, this is, this is pre-globalization. And during the Great Depression, this is totally nutty. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3138.6400000000003s)]
*  They're going to retaliate. So not only will U.S. imports shrink, but U.S. exports will shrink as [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3147.76s)]
*  well. Trump wants to use these tariffs as a revenue stream for the U.S. to pay for tax cuts. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3152.48s)]
*  Or as tariffs on foreign countries go up, taxes on American workers and families come down. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3158.24s)]
*  Studies found his proposal would likely bring in around a quarter of a trillion dollars per year, [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3165.12s)]
*  about 5% of what the federal government currently brings in with taxes. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3170.24s)]
*  So if tariffs are harmful, always harmful even to the economy, why is Trump so focused on them? [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3174.9599999999996s)]
*  In the last 20 years, the answer is because he's a fucking psycho. Okay. Let's see. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3181.12s)]
*  aggressive, investing in manufacturing to become the world's largest exporter. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3186.24s)]
*  Even today, they invest more than any other country. It has let them export things like [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3190.9599999999996s)]
*  steel and aluminum at below market values. That coupled with numerous trade rule violates. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3196.16s)]
*  It's funny to say this is like in an ominous way. China has become the industrial powerhouse of the [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3201.7599999999998s)]
*  world, but it's bad. It's unfair and bad. Wow. It turns out centralized planning is impossible [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3207.92s)]
*  to compete against. And the American centralized planning that only fucking that has no long-term [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3217.28s)]

*  No specs, nothing at first. No one even knew if the phone had five G because all the U S sanctions [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3880.0s)]
*  that cut Huawei off from advanced tech, a friend of that morning showed up in the lobby of my [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3884.3199999999997s)]
*  office with a new phone. We call it 4.99 G he said with a wink, we speed tested it, the five G [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3887.68s)]
*  phones in our office and it beat all of them. Huawei wasn't supposed to have a five G chip. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3893.12s)]
*  The timing of the job was significant. U S commerce secretary Gina Raimondo was it was in [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3897.12s)]

*  get close to this without the UV tech. It turned out that Huawei had secretly important tons of [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3910.64s)]
*  R and D for years into designing domestic chips. The chips performers showed a Huawei and SMIC had [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3915.44s)]

*  their ears to what is happening. Huawei is based based their five G tech on a scientific paper by [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3937.2s)]
*  Turkish scientists out of the other con. Nice. This is the same principle behind the sanctions [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3944.3199999999997s)]

*  is this is why the one belt one road initiative was so devastating. China wanted to develop Africa, [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3987.44s)]
*  not specifically because not exclusively because they wanted to extract raw minerals and rare [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=3991.68s)]

*  and they're socialist or anything like that. They just wanted new customers. And that's what's going [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4020.7200000000003s)]

*  problem. And yet while we have the capacity to feed everyone, the profit motive makes it so that [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4173.28s)]
*  we do not do that. I say one is more evil on its face than the other. If you want to use good, [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4180.0s)]

*  U S as the world's dominant economic and technological power. Trump introduced punitive [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4193.599999999999s)]

*  the dictionary is tariff. Trump is focused on raising tariffs to prevent China from shipping [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4211.84s)]
*  many of their goods into the United States that perhaps are subsidized by the government. And his [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4217.599999999999s)]

*  four year showdown with China. Let's rewind for a second. When China joined the World Trade [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4250.64s)]

*  China to ship cheap toys, t shirts and TVs around the globe and an export bonanza that helped lift [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4262.88s)]

*  China's national security goals are at the heart of its policymaking. It's the kind of grand ambition [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4303.92s)]
*  that would galvanize successive U.S. presidents into taking action. This is number one, but this [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4311.04s)]
*  is the first of many. The U.S. efforts to contain China's growth began with tariffs and some of the [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4316.0s)]
*  trade policies in the Trump administration. Basically, they sought to make it more expensive [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4323.6s)]

*  the imbalance that occurs when a nation imports more from a country than it exports to it. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4334.32s)]
*  President Biden is holding back on a decision to scrap any Trump era tariffs on China imports. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4339.52s)]

*  harder to transfer U.S. goods or U.S. technologies into China. The U.S. government stopped Huawei from [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4381.04s)]

*  Do people get the reference? What from a very, an incredibly famous movie? I think people will [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4686.32s)]
*  understand the reference. That's a bingo. Yeah. Anyway, this is, I get the reference just by what [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4692.4s)]
*  he's wearing. Yeah. You can just, you can pretty much figure out what's going on here. You know, [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4698.96s)]
*  Oh no, that's an anti-Semitic. I'm pretty sure. Yeah. Making a direct comparison to a famous [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4703.12s)]
*  representation of a fucking Nazi who hunted Jewish people is actually, is actually really anti-Semitic. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4708.16s)]
*  Yeah. It's only after the 6th millionth migrant that is killed in one of the concentration work [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4715.92s)]
*  camps, because the American government decided it's actually infinitely cheaper to just start [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4723.4400000000005s)]

*  you make this comparison. It doesn't, there's no other reason to make this comparison. There's no [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4735.6s)]
*  reason to learn about history as a matter of fact, because why could you learn? If you learn [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4741.04s)]
*  about history, then you start noticing the, the, the very clear similarities between, you know, [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4746.96s)]
*  former bad countries and this current country that I am conditioned into thinking is a good country. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4754.4s)]
*  Anyway, let's get back to China. Scientists and researchers, they've been very aggressive [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4760.96s)]
*  in applying for patents that they think are going to help them develop domestic industries [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4765.04s)]
*  that are critical to their future. When President Xi Jinping makes something a priority in China, [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4769.6s)]
*  he can point to banks to provide cheap financing. He can point to state owned enterprises to throw [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4774.64s)]
*  their full weight behind backing. Like, what do people think? What do, dude, dude, dude, [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4780.96s)]
*  what the fuck do people think like Nazi Germany's argument was? They, like, did they think that Nazi [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4786.320000000001s)]
*  Germany didn't also do a steady bit of dehumanizing propaganda to make Jewish people, to make the [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4792.0s)]
*  völkisch Germans think that all Jews were terrorists? They did. Like, we're running the same [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4799.04s)]
*  cycle. It wasn't like they woke up one day and we're like, yes, we are evil. Yeah, we love doing evil. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4804.24s)]
*  We know we are evil and we love doing it. It's our favorite thing is to be evil. That is why we're [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4809.76s)]
*  doing it. Like, no, people were, people were fed a healthy diet of propaganda leading up to this moment. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4816.24s)]
*  Okay. My suitcase. That's what, that's what the Germans said. My lolly. Which is why whenever I show, [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4824.0s)]
*  translated Hitler's speeches is like identical to like American, current American and current Israeli [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4832.24s)]
*  speeches from key figures in both of these governments, you know. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4840.4s)]
*  For instance, backers of companies like Shanghai Microelectronics Equipment [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4848.0s)]
*  considered China's best bet for competing with ASML's advanced lithography machines. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4852.16s)]
*  At this point, I think everybody believes that they're many years away from being able to match [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4856.639999999999s)]
*  ASML at the pinnacle of the industry, but they're pouring billions and billions of dollars into this [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4860.8s)]
*  effort and they're very determined to be able to close the gap as much as they possibly can. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4866.4s)]
*  Evidence that China's semiconductor ecosystem was expanding emerged in 2023 when Huawei released [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4871.68s)]
*  the Mate 60 or more precisely when Bloomberg News commissioned a research firm to take one apart. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4877.84s)]
*  Inside that phone was a semiconductor that was much more powerful than anybody thought China could [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4884.56s)]
*  make on its own. It suggested instead of being eight or 10 years behind the U.S., actually China [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4891.04s)]
*  was four to five years behind the U.S. But the cross application is what really, we can do this [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4898.88s)]
*  with a consumer product like a phone. It's just as easy to do this with much more sensitive technology [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4905.28s)]
*  that's used for military applications. In other areas, China really has charged ahead to take a lead. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4912.5599999999995s)]
*  Take a look at this chart. You can see China's market share of many high-tech exports growing, [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4919.599999999999s)]
*  particularly EVs, despite U.S. tariffs and restrictions on access to technology. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4924.88s)]
*  Ultimately, there is this idea that trade always gets through and that's sort of what we see when [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4930.08s)]
*  we think about the EV industry in China. So, for example, a big EV automaker like BYD is already [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4936.0s)]
*  getting around some of these potential restrictions by building factories in places like Thailand, [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4944.48s)]
*  in Hungary, and in Brazil. Trump wants to further limit imports of Chinese EVs and batteries [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4950.64s)]
*  and in his second term may try to fulfill a popular campaign pledge to protect U.S. carmakers. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4956.8s)]
*  I will impose whatever tariffs are required. You ain't never getting a BYD car. The only time you [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4962.72s)]
*  get into BYD cars if you go to Mexico or if you go to Canada and ride the bus, okay? That's it. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4968.88s)]
*  If you are living in the United States of America, you are not getting a BYD car anytime soon. Not [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4974.88s)]
*  today, not tomorrow, not yesterday. I'm sorry, sucks to suck. It ain't happening, okay? [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4980.96s)]
*  I mean, I wanted to, but like... No, Canada doesn't have BYD either. No, they do. They have it for bus [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4992.0s)]
*  fleets, I'm pretty sure. That's why I said they only have it. Yeah, unless you're fucking Ford [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=4998.24s)]
*  CEO Jim Farley, which I don't... I think some of that is fake. I don't think he like only drives [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=5005.6s)]
*  a BYD car exclusively, but I think he did go to China and saw BYD and was like, holy fuck, we're [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=5010.72s)]
*  cooked. In Washington is that the electric... Soon BYD also coming to Turkey as well, by the way. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=5015.68s)]
*  Vehicles and some of the... And yeah, it's not BYD. He owns a Xiaomi car, the Ford CEO. The [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=5024.0s)]
*  software behind them would be... And no, you can't get a BYD car. You can't... It's not just the [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=5028.96s)]
*  tariffs. They're not street legal, I'm pretty sure, in America. You can buy them in Mexico, [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=5033.36s)]
*  though. Be able to collect personal information and perhaps share it with the Chinese government, [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=5037.679999999999s)]
*  or at least with the companies that are involved in making those vehicles. It's the kind of rhetoric [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=5042.88s)]
*  Beijing has vehemently rejected. China will continue to firmly safeguard legitimate rights [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=5047.36s)]
*  and interests of its enterprises. We also support China's right to return to its own. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=5054.0s)]
*  We resolutely support the Chinese companies in maintaining their rights in accordance with the [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=5056.799999999999s)]
*  So have two US administrations hindered China in ways Trump initially intended? It doesn't appear so. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=5060.96s)]
*  The vast majority have made it in China 2025 targets that Bloomberg tracks actually have [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=5067.92s)]
*  been achieved or are on track to be achieved. Tariffs have helped cut America's trade deficit [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=5073.839999999999s)]
*  with its rival. But as we saw earlier, they haven't prevented China from boosting exports elsewhere. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=5078.879999999999s)]
*  And while the US may have slowed Beijing's progress in some areas, like advanced chip making, [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=5085.28s)]
*  overall Xi Jinping's industrial policies are successfully advancing China's tech. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=5090.4s)]
*  I don't understand when I look at like, economy broadcasters, they have a very different take on [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=5095.2s)]
*  what's going on in China and the Chinese economy than all of my favorite YouTube channels that keep [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=5103.2s)]
*  telling me that China is on the verge of collapse yesterday. Why is it that Foreign Policy magazine, [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=5108.32s)]
*  or Bloomberg or Wall Street Journal has a noticeably different approach to what is [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=5115.36s)]
*  happening with the Chinese economy and Chinese global dominance as a matter of fact, then [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=5121.12s)]
*  every one of my favorite fucking YouTubers that have millions and millions of views, I don't get it. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=5125.759999999999s)]
*  Technological capabilities. But even if the US hasn't managed to trip China yet, [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=5133.04s)]
*  nobody expects a second Trump administration to stop trying. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=5137.5199999999995s)]
*  If you look at the geopolitics, [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=5141.280000000001s)]
*  those are not letting Chinese EVs into the US harm consumers. Yes, but it doesn't even [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=5143.76s)]
*  fucking matter as long as we have a competitive EV industry. I don't even care. Okay. Yes, [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=5146.88s)]
*  I like Chinese EVs. I wish I could get one. But the reality of the matter is as long as we had like, [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=5151.6s)]
*  good competitive domestic manufacturing, I would be happy, especially if the fucking laborers were [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=5157.52s)]
*  paid well. The problem is we don't get that. And we don't get the Chinese EVs. It sucks. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT2a3dCDNvM&t=5163.6s)]
