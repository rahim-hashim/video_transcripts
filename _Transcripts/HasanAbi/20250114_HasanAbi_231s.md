# Preparing For The Interview | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns)
*  I've been prepping for the Bernie interview my whole life. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=0.0s)]
*  Okay, that's how I prep for the Bernie interview by just, you know, being a being an outspoken [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=2.4s)]
*  professional leftist political commentator for almost a decade. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=8.6s)]
*  Yeah, for a decade at this point. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=13.0s)]
*  We have a limited amount of time though. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=15.0s)]
*  So I'm just going to try to move through it as fast as I possibly can. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=16.7s)]
*  Anyway, Hassan x Bernie. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=21.8s)]
*  Greatest collab of all time. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=28.0s)]
*  It's crazy for many of you. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=29.3s)]
*  Bernie Sanders is probably like a major reason as to how you found me how you found yourself [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=30.900000000000002s)]
*  how you found your political identity, you know, and I think Bernie Sanders is is incredibly [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=37.6s)]
*  important in at least like the past decades politics. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=43.9s)]
*  He's very meaningful very important person for me personally and for many of you as well. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=49.7s)]
*  So that's why it's like kind of a interesting predicament where it's it's it's the circle. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=54.5s)]
*  It's the circle closing chat. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=61.6s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=63.5s)]
*  Is he joining in person or via video call? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=64.4s)]
*  That'd be really funny if I had him in my house, but no, he's not joining in person. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=66.6s)]
*  That would be incredible, but he will be joining via phone call chatters. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=71.9s)]
*  Don't be crazy. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=76.9s)]
*  Now have a blast off meme. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=77.6s)]
*  I already posted. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=79.4s)]
*  I already posted a blast off meme as well. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=80.4s)]
*  It is kind of weird. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=84.7s)]
*  I just realized it's kind of weird how much Bernie stuff I have by the way, like I have a puppet [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=86.10000000000001s)]
*  of Bernie like back there. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=91.2s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=93.80000000000001s)]
*  I have so much Bernie stuff everywhere that is just a part of the background of the stream [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=94.5s)]
*  and it's like a part of my life that I didn't even really consider. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=100.2s)]
*  That's a wild thing. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=107.0s)]
*  Like I'm straight up interviewing the guy that I have the dolls of, you know, how do you [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=108.10000000000001s)]
*  prep for the Bernie interview brother? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=114.2s)]
*  I've been prepping for the Bernie interview my whole life. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=115.7s)]
*  Okay, that's how I prep for the Bernie interview by just, you know, being a being an outspoken [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=118.3s)]
*  professional leftist political commentator for almost a decade. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=124.2s)]
*  Yeah for a decade at this point. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=128.7s)]
*  We have a limited amount of time though. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=130.5s)]
*  So I'm just going to try to move through it as fast as I possibly can. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=132.1s)]
*  Are you not having him at your house because you're afraid he'll be mad at your house is too [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=136.3s)]
*  expensive for a socialist? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=139.7s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=140.9s)]
*  He's going to say he's going to say wow, this house is so big. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=143.4s)]
*  You're so phony. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=148.3s)]
*  No, he's not going to say that you want to know why because he's mr. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=150.1s)]
*  House owner himself. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=153.0s)]
*  Do you not remember? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=154.5s)]
*  Do you not remember how much people freaked out over Bernard being like, oh he owns a [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=155.70000000000002s)]
*  house. How can he be a socialist virtually everything that people yell at me about they've [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=161.1s)]
*  yelled at him about as well because that's just like a common Meta and it's funny because [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=165.8s)]
*  I really wish I could have gotten like a Lex Friedman style long extensive interview [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=172.2s)]
*  opportunity with him because those are there's a lot more interesting stuff that I would [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=177.79999999999998s)]
*  love to talk to him about outside of just like what's immediately happening in the world [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=183.1s)]
*  of politics and I'm working on that for the record. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=188.4s)]
*  Just so you guys know, I'm working on that. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=193.5s)]
*  I'm working on doing something more extensive and in person, but this is a great introduction [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=196.79999999999998s)]
*  something more long form. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=206.29999999999998s)]
*  I think asking him if he balls I know with that will be a point of conversation, but [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=207.7s)]
*  in any case. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=213.6s)]
*  House guys are the new wife guys. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=220.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=222.6s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=223.1s)]
*  Well, that's the blast off meme. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zO5mM5g_ns&t=223.6s)]
