*  She gave me one full with the same shit. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=344.0s)]
*  I guess, you know, I didn't make the cut. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=346.0s)]
*  If you wanted to be on the meeting green, you could have been on the meeting green and they would have brought you stuff. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=348.0s)]
*  It's fine. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=350.0s)]

*  Cute. Oh, there's a Georgie. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=358.0s)]
*  I wanted to make you a Georgie for a party when I ran out of time. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=360.0s)]
*  Georgie. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=362.0s)]
*  Georgie. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=364.0s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=366.0s)]
*  This is sick. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=368.0s)]
*  Did you make this? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=370.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=372.0s)]
*  No, that. She made that. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=374.0s)]
*  Somebody else made this. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=376.0s)]
*  What is wrong with you? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=378.0s)]
*  I didn't get a gift. It's okay. You can get a hug. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=380.0s)]
*  You're crazy. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=382.0s)]
*  I'm a menace. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=384.0s)]
*  That's crazy. You're not paying attention at all. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=386.0s)]
*  No. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=388.0s)]
*  Hello. Nice to meet you. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=390.0s)]
*  What? No one's sad. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=392.0s)]
*  I'm so happy, Maya. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=394.0s)]
*  Maya doesn't like you. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=396.0s)]
*  Hello. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=398.0s)]
*  I feel like there's a noticeable energy change since I've arrived on scene. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=400.0s)]
*  I don't think Maya likes you. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=404.0s)]
*  I actually reviewed my video on stream. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=406.0s)]
*  Oh, I did? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=408.0s)]
*  For the love of God. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=410.0s)]
*  These were really nice things. Thank you. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=412.0s)]
*  Oh, that's so nice. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=414.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=416.0s)]
*  I thought that's a Doja Cat. I was like, what? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=418.0s)]
*  She's here. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=420.0s)]
*  Your nails. Oh my gosh. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=422.0s)]
*  Your nails are so cute. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=424.0s)]
*  You made them. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=426.0s)]
*  That's sick. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=428.0s)]
*  He's on. He's on. He's on focus. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=430.0s)]
*  Oh, God. No worries. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=432.0s)]
*  Someone gave him some Adderall. This is crazy. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=434.0s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=438.0s)]
*  Picture? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=440.0s)]
*  Do you want me to be in it or out of it? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=442.0s)]
*  You can be in it. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=444.0s)]
*  You can be in it. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=446.0s)]
*  You've given him a complex, Maya. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=448.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=452.0s)]
*  Hell yeah. Well, thank you guys. Thank you for coming. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=454.0s)]
*  Get stickers. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=456.0s)]
*  You're doing good. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=460.0s)]
*  Now that Faze swag is here, that means that [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=462.0s)]
*  the rest of Faze, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=464.0s)]
*  it's not how you do it. It's just how you do it. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=466.0s)]
*  What? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=468.0s)]
*  Oh! [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=470.0s)]
*  Look. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=472.0s)]
*  Do you want to sign it? Yeah. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=474.0s)]
*  It won't pop, but it will probably deflate. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=476.0s)]
*  So you can sign my badge. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=478.0s)]
*  Look, Caroline and Will are on this one. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=480.0s)]
*  Will is on this. Oh, he's on that too. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=482.0s)]
*  But Caroline was scared she was going to pop it. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=484.0s)]
*  So, people, if you want to sign it. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=486.0s)]
*  I also, I feel really bad [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=488.0s)]
*  because I only have one bracelet. No, it's okay. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=490.0s)]
*  No, I didn't know this guy. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=492.0s)]
*  He's a problem. I know. He freaks out when other people get presents. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=494.0s)]
*  And it's safe on the fridge. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=496.0s)]
*  Yeah, I've been surprised. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=498.0s)]
*  So, like, I have a magic bracelet for you guys. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=500.0s)]
*  Oh, that's so sad. It's okay. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=502.0s)]
*  Haha! You don't get a gift either. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=504.0s)]
*  I'm pretty sure that goes to my mom. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=506.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=508.0s)]
*  Wait, where's my, oh, here. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=510.0s)]
*  She's worked with animals for too long. She's become one. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=512.0s)]
*  Aww, that's so sweet. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=514.0s)]
*  And I wanted to say that [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=516.0s)]
*  I've been listening to Wine About It for a while. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=518.0s)]
*  Not Ferian though. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=520.0s)]
*  Alone. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=522.0s)]
*  Okay, alright. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=524.0s)]
*  But Wine About It really inspired me to go to therapy. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=526.0s)]
*  Oh, hell yeah. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=528.0s)]
*  And get medication that I actually just graduated last week. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=530.0s)]
*  Congrats! [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=532.0s)]
*  No, it's good because it balances it out. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=534.0s)]
*  So, positive feedback from Wine About It, and then we hit up with Ferian. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=536.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=538.0s)]
*  It's a healthy media diad. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=540.0s)]
*  So, like, I listen to Wine About It in the morning, and then Ferian at night. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=542.0s)]
*  And then you watch QT get bullied by misogynistic men. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=544.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=546.0s)]
*  It's okay. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=548.0s)]
*  It's important. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=550.0s)]
*  Well, let's take a picture. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=552.0s)]
*  Do you want me to be in it? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=554.0s)]
*  You really gave him a compliment. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=556.0s)]
*  Hassan, you can be in every picture. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=558.0s)]
*  No, I want to... [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=560.0s)]
*  This is the one shot that people have. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=562.0s)]
*  I don't want to ruin it. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=564.0s)]
*  Can I take a photo with you guys in my little handbag? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=566.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=568.0s)]
*  Every time I see one of these bags now, I'm like, I got one for QT. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=570.0s)]
*  Hell yeah, you're so welcome. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=584.0s)]
*  Alright, I gotta leave in a second to go to the phase auditions. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=586.0s)]
*  I'm gonna be there too. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=588.0s)]
*  I'll see you there. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=590.0s)]
*  I'm gonna be there with that before you. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=592.0s)]

*  I do like Ferian. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=600.0s)]
*  Hassan's actually the only one I haven't got to meet today. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=602.0s)]
*  Hassan! [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=604.0s)]

*  Alright, you wanna do it quick? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=608.0s)]
*  Hi Hassan's chat, I'm sorry he left you. I don't know, his attention span is crazy. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=610.0s)]
*  I signed this right before. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=612.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=614.0s)]
*  I forget which, if it was Ferian or Wine About It, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=616.0s)]
*  but you were talking about the tattoo that you wanted a long time ago, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=618.0s)]
*  and I was like, I don't have that exact one. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=620.0s)]
*  Living is in his eyes closed, I was gonna put it right here. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=622.0s)]
*  On my ribcage. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=624.0s)]
*  In Titebond. He wanted to meet you. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=626.0s)]
*  You're the only Ferian guy I've not met yet. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=628.0s)]
*  Oh hell yeah, nice to meet you. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5aD0fITDZU&t=630.0s)]
