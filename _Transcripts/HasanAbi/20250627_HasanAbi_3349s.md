# U.S. Is Funding A FAKE Gaza Aid Trap | HasanAbi Archive
**HasanAbi:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw)
*  as well, which I will get to in a second. But understand that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=0.0s)]
*  every single thing that we mentioned here, every single [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=4.0s)]
*  thing that we have reported on here on this broadcast, for [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=9.16s)]
*  months before the Gaza humanitarian foundation was even [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=13.72s)]
*  implemented. And before they even entered the strip has now [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=16.62s)]
*  happened. Now, a lot of you guys already know I've talked [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  extensively about the Gaza humanitarian foundation. It's a [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=29.58s)]
*  fake charity, fake aid group that was designed by the US and [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=32.059999999999995s)]
*  Israel to overtake, to overtake all aid distribution in the Gaza [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=35.62s)]
*  Strip with the sole purpose of causing chaos and and targeted [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=41.14s)]
*  and actions of, of the starving population of Gaza that is [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=45.739999999999995s)]
*  desperate for aid you. Okay. And the entire, the entirety of the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=50.42s)]
*  world's humanitarian groups obviously criticize this. It is [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=58.42s)]
*  perfidy. It is illegal. This is illegal. Utilizing aid [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=63.620000000000005s)]
*  distribution and creating a military purpose for aid [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=69.1s)]
*  distribution is illegal, right? This is a civilian population [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=71.98s)]
*  that you are starving. But of course, genocide and cleansing [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=76.56s)]
*  is illegal. So this is just more illegal. You seem disappointed [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=79.74000000000001s)]
*  bro isn't racist. What do you mean? What? Which bro? A lot of [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=84.18s)]
*  confusing takes I'm hearing from chat was waiting for you to take [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=88.54s)]
*  on the idea of being ordered to fire on civilians report. No, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=91.66000000000001s)]
*  we're going to get to that in a second. This this is this [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=94.02000000000001s)]
*  dovetails into that. So the Gaza humanitarian foundation, which [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=95.98s)]
*  was already controversial from its inception, has, has had a [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=101.08000000000001s)]
*  litany of legal complications as well. It's based out of [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=107.14000000000001s)]
*  Switzerland. And even the Swiss government has talked about [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=110.7s)]
*  potentially prosecuting them or potentially uncovering who [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=113.94s)]
*  their their funders are, we already know that it's the United [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=118.46s)]
*  States and Israel. These are two belligerents in this cleansing [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=120.74s)]
*  campaign in Gaza. And and the humanitarian aid distribution, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=124.02s)]
*  aid distribution in general has to be done by independent third [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=129.38s)]
*  parties, right? And yet, this is not the case. These are [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=134.54s)]
*  belligerent occupiers that are engaging in an unjust war, a war [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=142.01999999999998s)]
*  of extermination. It's an cleansing campaign. But they're [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=148.14s)]
*  also running out of money, I guess. And because they're [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=152.61999999999998s)]
*  running out of money, the United States is now going to offer [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=157.73999999999998s)]
*  additional funds $30 million to the Gaza humanitarian [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=160.01999999999998s)]
*  foundation, even though since the GHF overtook a distribution [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=163.85999999999999s)]
*  in the strip, it has been incredibly with, according to [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=169.98s)]
*  Haaretz reporting that confirmed our reporting from both drop [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=174.17999999999998s)]
*  site news and also Palestinian journalists in perpetuity for [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=178.29999999999998s)]
*  the past month or so that they are actually the Israeli [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=182.01999999999998s)]
*  occupying force is, as a matter of fact, actually striking. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=186.78s)]
*  Yeah, hold on. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=192.66s)]
*  Sorry, there's a lot of chaos happening in the background here, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=193.7s)]
*  my mom and dad, watch them, watch them. Okay, it states is to [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=196.22s)]
*  give $30 million in funding to the Gaza humanitarian [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=203.42s)]
*  foundation, which is a US and Israeli backed body set up to [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=207.14s)]
*  distribute aid in Gaza. It's the first known direct US funding [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=210.78s)]
*  for the group, the GHF, backed by armed use of weapons and [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=215.5s)]
*  contractors and Israeli troops has been operating in the strip [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=220.82s)]
*  since the end of May following an 11 week aid blockade by [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=223.82s)]
*  Israel. On Tuesday, the UN said more than 400 Palestinians had [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=227.5s)]
*  been killed in recent weeks by the Israeli military, while [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=232.06s)]
*  trying to collect food at the distribution sites. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=235.22s)]
*  Yeah, update Gaza Health Ministry releases numbers broken up day [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=238.42s)]
*  by day of passing is killed and injured near a distribution sites [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=242.62s)]
*  run by the Israeli army. The Israeli army is now being [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=245.38s)]
*  distributed sites run by the Israeli and American run Gaza [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=248.46s)]
*  humanitarian foundation. As of as of yesterday, the number is [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=250.9s)]
*  549 aid seekers have been killed, 4066 have been injured [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=258.42s)]
*  and 39 are still missing. Okay, they're using the aid as bait [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=263.86s)]
*  to draw in Palestinian civilians a starving population that [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=268.98s)]
*  they've deliberately starved desperate for food as a trap as [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=272.42s)]
*  a trap to assassinate execute a kill as many Palestinians as [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=278.06s)]
*  they want to. It is a playing field. Okay, that is precisely [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=282.66s)]
*  what this is. Now, in the process of doing this, there's [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=288.14s)]
*  also there's also some chaos that they've implemented already [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=292.7s)]
*  at the the aid distribution drops even before the Gaza [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=296.98s)]
*  humanitarian foundation came in with American mercenaries that [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=300.42s)]
*  are being protected by the Israeli occupying force. One of [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=304.58s)]
*  the things that the Israeli government did openly, which [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=308.38s)]
*  again, we reported on, but then the Israeli government openly [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=311.53999999999996s)]
*  took ownership over is a criminal element of ISIS [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=315.38s)]
*  affiliates at amongst different clans within within the Gaza [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=321.02s)]
*  Strip that they have that they have armed and offered gear to [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=327.18s)]
*  so that they can extort the truck drivers and and all of the [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=333.53999999999996s)]
*  other people that are delivering aid into the strip by force. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=338.7s)]
*  These ISIS affiliate gangs now known as the Popular Forces are [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=342.14s)]
*  working inside of the red zones. Red zones are areas that are [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=346.9s)]
*  already de facto fields, right? If you are Palestinian and you [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=351.18s)]
*  are inside of a red zone, Israel will kill you Israel does kill [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=355.46s)]
*  with either drones or, you know, direct gunfire. Okay. However, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=359.78000000000003s)]
*  the ISIS affiliate drug dealers that were previously imprisoned [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=366.58s)]
*  for either being ISIS affiliates collaborators of the Israeli [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=372.18s)]
*  state or drug dealers are now open and and operating in the [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=375.62s)]
*  strip impunity created by the Israeli state. The Israeli [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=382.06s)]
*  government offers them protective fire with drones as [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=386.58s)]
*  the remainder of the the civil the remainder of the civil police [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=392.74s)]
*  system that exists in the strip, which is obviously marginal is [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=397.62s)]
*  trying to actively combat these gangs and also Hamas is actively [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=403.62s)]
*  combating these gangs as well. Part of the reason why this is [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=408.34s)]
*  also happening is because Israel has successfully gotten America [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=412.14s)]
*  to stamp out on raw by falsely smearing on raw as a aiding and [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=416.38s)]
*  abetting in October seven. This is false. They have never [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=421.82s)]
*  actually shown even a fraction of evidence to suggest this. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=425.54s)]
*  They've simply claimed it and the American government also [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=429.54s)]
*  claimed it after Israel claimed it. And then they turned around [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=431.98s)]
*  and shut off on raw. And then they also stopped other aid [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=434.98s)]
*  groups that previously were sanctioned by the Israeli [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=440.26s)]
*  government or previously allowed to operate in the Gaza Strip by [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=443.42s)]
*  the Israeli government to even enter the Gaza Strip. The entire [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=446.1s)]
*  purpose of this is to starve the Palestinian population. Okay, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=449.58000000000004s)]
*  but the Gaza humanitarian foundation was created as a trap [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=454.18s)]
*  as an aid trap, so that they could still operate with some [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=456.86s)]
*  semblance of legality in their own estimation, something that [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=461.5s)]
*  finance Minister Bezalel Smoltz, who is far right himself has [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=465.58000000000004s)]
*  openly admitted there has to be some kind of aid distribution. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=468.90000000000003s)]
*  It's like it's basically like the the the aid peer that the [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=473.62s)]
*  previous administration had designed to make it seem to [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=479.06s)]
*  international authorities that there is like some kind of legal [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=482.14s)]
*  protective cover that they aren't directly and deliberately [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=485.3s)]
*  starving maliciously starving the entire Palestinian [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=488.5s)]
*  population because that is an undeniable crime that that makes [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=490.66s)]
*  it impossible to play the song and dance that they're not [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=495.54s)]
*  actually invested in, even though we all know that they are. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=497.98s)]
*  Okay, but because this has been a disastrous, a deliberately [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=501.74s)]
*  disastrous process, and more than 400 people have been killed, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=507.26s)]
*  a lot of them, children, by the way, like straight up children [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=513.5s)]
*  that have been sniped, executed according to, to first hand [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=517.74s)]
*  testimony from other Palestinians that have survived, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=522.34s)]
*  you know, being lined up and being executed sometimes by the [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=524.9s)]
*  popular forces, which is like I said, the ISIS affiliate forces [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=528.94s)]
*  that Israel is aided and abetted, and other times directly [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=532.1800000000001s)]
*  by the Israeli occupying force that that because of the [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=536.5400000000001s)]
*  controversies, this group has not obviously been able to [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=542.4200000000001s)]
*  accrue necessary funds to continue operations. So now the [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=546.3000000000001s)]
*  United States government is offering $30 million to the Gaza [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=549.58s)]
*  humanitarian foundation. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=552.22s)]
*  Well, let's speak to our Gaza correspondent, Rushdie Abou Alouf, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=554.5400000000001s)]
*  who's in Cairo for us. Rushdie, just explain why we're seeing [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=557.46s)]
*  the level of casualties, according to the UN and other [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=562.34s)]
*  sources at these distribution sites, how concentrated the [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=566.5400000000001s)]
*  crowds are around them, because there are just four main sites, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=571.1s)]
*  aren't there? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=574.5s)]
*  Yeah, all of them are in the south, not in the north, where [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=575.14s)]
*  half of the population exists, you know, in the south, they [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=577.86s)]
*  have four distribution centers, two in the north. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=581.58s)]
*  Who composes the ISIS groups and what incentive do they have [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=584.7800000000001s)]
*  to target innocent Palestinians? I mean, there are always going [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=587.18s)]
*  to be opportunists and collaborators that think that [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=591.26s)]
*  they can maybe take control over the Gaza Strip, inevitably, if [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=594.14s)]
*  this this ethnic cleansing campaign ends. So you know, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=597.62s)]
*  there have always been collaborators that work with [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=601.2199999999999s)]
*  Mossad and collaborators that work with the Israeli occupying [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=603.02s)]
*  force. These guys were previously working with the [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=605.5s)]
*  Israeli occupying force, they're comprised of people that in its [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=609.6999999999999s)]
*  leadership structure, are known collaborators, and no ISIS [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=613.06s)]
*  affiliates that used Rafa tunnels to bring in drugs into [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=617.8199999999999s)]
*  the Gaza Strip and sold drugs in order to make money. Now they [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=622.02s)]
*  just make money directly because Israel is paying them to do [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=625.18s)]
*  this. They engage in the process of extortion and steal aid. Part [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=628.42s)]
*  of the reason why they do this, I suspect is so that Israel can [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=634.14s)]
*  film them stealing aid, and then say this is Hamas stealing aid [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=637.18s)]
*  when it's the exact opposite. As a matter of fact, some of them [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=642.06s)]
*  are Palestinians, I think a lot of them are Palestinians. And, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=645.66s)]
*  you know, some of them probably have come into the strip from [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=650.14s)]
*  outside at one point or another, when there was an opportunity to [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=653.5799999999999s)]
*  enter the Gaza Strip. There are always collaborators that exist [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=659.8599999999999s)]
*  in in conflicts. So there's also reports that came out yesterday [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=663.1199999999999s)]
*  from a pharmacist in Gaza that they were potentially putting [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=668.78s)]
*  oxycodone pills inside of the flower bags. Not sure how [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=671.78s)]
*  serialized this is not sure how common this is. But there is [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=677.4599999999999s)]
*  additional reporting on this coming from DropSite News, as [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=681.18s)]
*  well, which I will get to in a second. But understand that every [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=685.62s)]
*  single thing that we mentioned here, every single thing that we [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=689.9s)]
*  have reported on here on this broadcast, for months before the [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=695.4599999999999s)]
*  Gaza Humanitarian Foundation was even implemented. And before [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=700.02s)]
*  they even entered the strip has now happened, that this was [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=704.6999999999999s)]
*  simply a direct and a utilization of aid distribution as a form of [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=709.9s)]
*  war to continue achieving military goals, which is again [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=716.14s)]
*  illegal. They are not only starving the Palestinian [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=719.8199999999999s)]
*  population, but then they're offering a crumb of food in the [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=722.46s)]
*  process to, you know, the Palestinian children that trek [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=726.6s)]
*  miles and miles to get there that avoid gunfire. They shoot [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=731.72s)]
*  deliberately at the Palestinians that are trying to receive aid [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=736.16s)]
*  from the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=739.64s)]
*  Of one and can you miss and one in the middle camps and it's all [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=741.88s)]
*  in an area under Israeli security control. So there is [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=745.84s)]
*  always a presence of Israeli troops around not inside the [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=750.0400000000001s)]
*  centers. And we see every night thousands of people, they gather [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=755.12s)]
*  the queue, and then they push towards the center in the under [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=759.6s)]
*  darkness where the troops are there. And every night we get [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=765.32s)]
*  report about Israeli drones and tanks, open fire on the ground. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=769.24s)]
*  When we did ask the people, why you go? Why you risk your life? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=774.52s)]
*  This they always say because we have no other alternative. They [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=778.52s)]
*  prefer the old mechanism of food distributed, distributing to [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=782.52s)]
*  their, you know, doorstep or at least to their neighborhoods. And [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=786.72s)]
*  the only like organization capable of doing this is the UN [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=790.84s)]
*  agencies, which the Americans are not supporting. And they [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=795.32s)]
*  prefer this in your Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=798.4s)]
*  And Rishy, just very briefly, what is the hope that that [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=802.48s)]
*  situation may improve for Gazans in desperate need of aid with [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=806.28s)]
*  this huge injection of funds from the US? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=810.8s)]
*  Well, from Gaza point of view, on policy, the people who work in [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=813.52s)]
*  this organization, $30 million is very [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=817.3199999999999s)]
*  my friend is a nurse serving with the doctors on boarders in [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=820.7199999999999s)]
*  Gaza right now and says that every time food distribution is [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=823.9599999999999s)]
*  announced, they get ready for an influx of wounded and they [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=826.5999999999999s)]
*  haven't even been wrong yet. They've had 1000s upon 1000 [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=828.8s)]
*  wounded to care for those far yet 4000 plus wounded since the [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=831.68s)]
*  GHF Bolshevist started and when we say wounded, it's not like a [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=837.64s)]
*  light graze. Okay, we're talking like people who's like, legs [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=840.72s)]
*  have been shot off. People who got shot but survived. Somehow, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=844.56s)]
*  like that type of wounding [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=851.3199999999999s)]
*  little comparing to what is needed. Each truck cost about [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=853.72s)]
*  half million dollars and Gaza needs 400 500 trucks every day. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=857.52s)]
*  So the people were appreciating and I mean, any money given to [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=862.96s)]
*  Gaza, but this $30 million is considered very little to what [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=867.36s)]
*  is Gaza really need. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=872.6s)]
*  Rushdie, thank you. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=874.84s)]
*  On Abu Shabab, Israeli reports are saying the gang is having [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=876.64s)]
*  difficulties getting out of their small areas. So they're [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=879.28s)]
*  upset at him over that. Yeah. Israeli report warns relying on [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=881.2s)]
*  Abu Shabab's militia in Gaza is destined to fail. Part of the [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=886.08s)]
*  reason why is because while Israel has offered them [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=889.48s)]
*  protective cover with drones, and also given them arms and gear [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=892.24s)]
*  to be able to cause destabilization in the strip, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=896.5600000000001s)]
*  they're still getting their shit pushed in by Hamas soldiers [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=899.48s)]
*  and routinely getting or I think like they, they basically [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=903.24s)]
*  eviscerated half of Abu Shabab's militia, the Popular Forces, the [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=908.1600000000001s)]
*  ISIS affiliates, militia in the region at one point or another. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=913.2s)]
*  And they just can't keep up at all. Israel appears to have [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=921.12s)]
*  suffered yet another setback in his ongoing war on the Gaza [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=924.72s)]
*  Strip. This time due to his reliance on a militia that it is [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=927.12s)]
*  recently armed and funded in the hope of it playing multiple [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=930.32s)]
*  roles, including supporting the Israeli army and replacing [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=932.6800000000001s)]
*  Hamas power on the ground. The Israeli newspaper yet you know, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=934.76s)]
*  has reported that the militia led by Yasser Abu Shabab is [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=939.48s)]
*  struggling to fulfill the task Israel had expected it to carry [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=942.08s)]
*  out in the Gaza Strip to help establish control over the [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=944.6s)]
*  territory. According to the paper, the militia consists of [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=947.36s)]
*  400 fighters and is mainly operating in the buffer zone [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=950.24s)]
*  near Rafa. They set up headquarters inside of the Red [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=952.64s)]
*  Zone. It's literally an Israeli headquarters that they are [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=957.3199999999999s)]
*  operating out of. It is so far failed to expand its presence [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=960.92s)]
*  beyond this limited area. In a recent statement, the militia [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=964.28s)]
*  whose leader Abu Shabab was previously mentioned in the [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=967.08s)]
*  United Nations internal memo is being responsible for the [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=969.0s)]
*  systematic looting of humanitarian aid said, we expect [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=971.28s)]
*  an immediate solution to the problem of aid theft. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=974.96s)]
*  Distribution will take place under a new mechanism to ensure [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=977.24s)]
*  that every citizen receives his share. However, it remains [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=979.68s)]
*  unclear whether the militia will be involved in the [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=982.52s)]
*  distribution process, how it would do so and to what extent [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=984.28s)]
*  while the US funded Gaza humanitarian foundation [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=987.6s)]
*  continues his operations in the strip. Meanwhile, the militia's [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=989.72s)]
*  deputy leader whose forces are working alongside the Israeli [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=992.24s)]
*  army accuses Hamas of leading a coordinated campaign to seize [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=994.52s)]
*  aid shipments. Meanwhile, this is what the Gaza humanitarian [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=999.3199999999999s)]
*  foundation is doing. This is from DropSite News from [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=1002.64s)]
*  yesterday, the Israeli occupying force is waiting for aid on [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=1005.8s)]
*  Salah al-Din Street in Wadi Gaza. On Facebook, the GHF page [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=1009.24s)]
*  announced the opening of the distribution point only to close [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=1013.9200000000001s)]
*  it four minutes later. Four minutes of aid delivery [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=1017.0s)]
*  immediately followed by gunfire on innocent starving Palestinians. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=1020.6800000000001s)]
*  If it isn't a death trap, then what is it? 15 human rights and [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=1024.04s)]
*  legal organizations have warned that privatized humanitarian [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=1027.76s)]
*  operators in Gaza about the risk of legal liability for [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=1031.4s)]
*  complicity in serious violations of international law. This was [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=1034.28s)]
*  part of the reason why the initial leader of the Gaza [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=1037.56s)]
*  humanitarian foundation, a former marine sniper turned into [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=1040.48s)]
*  a private mercenary quit one day after the Gaza humanitarian [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=1044.56s)]
*  foundation was slated to start its distribution scheme. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=1049.24s)]
*  Literally, he was like, I don't want to put my name on this. This [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=1053.76s)]
*  is completely unacceptable. There have also been reports of [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=1056.3999999999999s)]
*  other former mercenaries, oftentimes, again, American [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=1059.8s)]
*  soldiers that are now mercenaries that say that have [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=1064.36s)]
*  reported in the news like in Zateo as well under anonymity, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=1068.4799999999998s)]
*  that their aid distribution mechanism is simply a deadly [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=1072.08s)]
*  affair for the Palestinians. GHF announced that the Wadi Gaza [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=1076.0s)]
*  distribution site opened and then shut just four minutes [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=1081.32s)]

*  This was from last month's most of his Gaza aid is just enough [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=1722.92s)]

*  The goal he insisted is to conquer clear and stay until [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=1732.8s)]
*  Gaza is dismantled beyond recognition. Understand that [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=1735.68s)]

*  Bodies lay bleeding on the ground all around me. This is [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=1791.52s)]

*  this entire operation must be shut down. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=1797.84s)]

*  been bullshit. As a matter of fact, the only people that have [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=1813.72s)]
*  tampered with aid distribution have been criminal elements [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=1817.4399999999998s)]
*  which Hamas has unironically executed for the crime of [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=1819.8799999999999s)]
*  disrupting the aid delivery mechanism. There have been [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=1824.84s)]
*  instances of chaos at the point of distribution because people [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=1828.08s)]

*  trying to desperately get as much aid as they possibly can [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=1835.28s)]
*  so they can survive beyond that point of chaos, which again, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=1838.08s)]
*  Israel wants. The only groups that have actually caused chaos [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=1841.72s)]
*  and tried to steal aid or extort the truckers that bring in the [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=1846.52s)]
*  aid is the Abu Shabaab militancy. Okay, the ISIS [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=1850.6s)]

*  of 56 trucks per day when the UN says the people of Gaza need [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=1872.12s)]
*  hundreds. Arguments about disinformation are one thing. But [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=1876.04s)]

*  Now, before we move on away from this, there's more information [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=1884.24s)]

*  the Gaza Government media office saying that oxycodone has been [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=1891.2s)]
*  found in the US backed aid flower bags. We covered this [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=1894.44s)]
*  yesterday. There's also the Haaretz report as well that I'm [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=1896.96s)]
*  going to get to. But the Gaza Government media office is [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=1902.44s)]

*  Kimberly, this news just coming in to us in the last few [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2094.8s)]

*  be? [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2102.0s)]

*  fact that while these discussions were taking place, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2142.04s)]

*  testimony from IDF soldiers is really occupying for soldiers. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2201.68s)]
*  The Harris newspaper published a report, a damning report that [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2207.2000000000003s)]
*  confirmed what Palestinian journalists have been saying for [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2211.4s)]
*  fucking months at this point, for the past month, basically. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2216.04s)]
*  Okay, okay, let's go back. This is the report IDF soldiers say [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2220.8s)]
*  they were ordered to fire at unarmed crowds near Gaza food [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2225.12s)]

*  and mortars as well. Here's the summary of it. Here's the [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2247.4s)]
*  breakdown. Haritz confirms Israeli soldiers ordered a fire [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2252.48s)]

*  areas as a killing field noting there is no enemy and no [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2267.8s)]
*  weapons. Here are some of the most important important [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2270.92s)]
*  findings from the report. One IDF officer said the killings [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2273.48s)]
*  aren't isolated mistakes, but a part of a pattern dubbed [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2277.36s)]

*  reported casualties every day. Another soldier recalled being [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2322.2s)]
*  told to fire a shell at a crowd to send a message. Israeli [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2325.68s)]
*  soldiers said demolition crews are often present at aid sites, [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2329.7799999999997s)]
*  and that private contractors are being paid to level homes [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2332.64s)]

*  IDF intentionally shooting Gazans at aid centers is a blood [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2365.88s)]
*  libel. Now, of course, as you know, at this point, 20 months [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2368.84s)]
*  in to this ethnic cleansing campaign, whenever an Israeli [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2372.84s)]
*  official says something is blood libel, know that it is 100% true [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2376.2400000000002s)]
*  when an Israeli official says something is blood libel or [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2381.5s)]
*  someone who defends Israel and Israel defender says something [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2385.2400000000002s)]

*  Absolutely the truth. Okay, it just simply means I can't refute [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2392.96s)]
*  this information and I choose not to refute this information. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2398.28s)]
*  And therefore, I will just say it's fake. It's a lie. It's not [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2401.48s)]
*  real. I assume you saw this. Oh, we'll do it in a second. We'll [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2406.32s)]
*  get to that in a second. Let's talk story now about Israeli [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2411.2400000000002s)]
*  soldiers who say they were ordered to shoot people near food [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2413.6000000000004s)]
*  distribution centers in Gaza. The Haritz newspaper reports that [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2416.44s)]
*  some soldiers were told to fire heavy weapons to disperse people. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2419.6000000000004s)]
*  Let's now speak to one of the journalists behind that report [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2423.96s)]
*  Nia Hassan joins us from West Jerusalem. Nia, welcome to Al Jazeera. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2427.08s)]
*  Good to have you with us. The headline is chilling. IDF soldiers [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2431.32s)]
*  ordered to shoot deliberately at unarmed Gazans waiting for [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2435.8s)]
*  humanitarian aid. It seems everyone, including ordinary [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2439.16s)]
*  hungry civilians are deemed to be targets. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2443.24s)]
*  Yes, well, we know for the last month or so that there are some [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2446.68s)]
*  very violent incidents around those distribution centers in Gaza. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2451.6s)]
*  And there were more than 500 casualties around those centers. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2460.16s)]
*  And now, me and my colleagues, Yaniv Kubovich and Barpeleg, we brought [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2469.8399999999997s)]
*  testimonies by soldiers and commanders from the IDF that telling us [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2476.0800000000004s)]
*  the policy, the fire policy that make this happen. What they are [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2484.44s)]
*  telling us is that the IDF is actually communicate the Gaza population [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2493.44s)]
*  by fire, by fire, live ammunition. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2500.92s)]
*  Of course, of course, Nia, this is not it's not something we don't [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2505.04s)]
*  already know. I mean, our reporters have been reporting this has been [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2508.32s)]
*  going on for a long, long time. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2511.7200000000003s)]
*  But it is surprising to hear it directly, isn't it? [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2514.1200000000003s)]
*  From those soldiers. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2517.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah. Make no mistake. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2518.76s)]
*  Make no mistake. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2521.1600000000003s)]
*  This is not new information. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2523.04s)]
*  And especially, especially if you were in here for the past month, you [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2525.76s)]
*  already knew this. OK, this is simply confirmation coming from Israeli [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2531.7200000000003s)]
*  reporting, OK, from Haaretz. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2537.0800000000004s)]
*  Now, Mohammed Shahada says Haaretz is big expose today is literally [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2539.84s)]
*  word for word what we Palestinians have said 20 days ago. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2544.32s)]
*  Like always, when we say it, it's a conspiracy theory. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2547.6400000000003s)]
*  When Israeli journalists say it, it's groundbreaking, brave and compelling. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2550.1600000000003s)]
*  Make no mistake. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2555.28s)]
*  I'm of two different minds on this. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2557.2000000000003s)]
*  On the one hand, obviously, I trust the underground sources to to explain [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2559.1200000000003s)]
*  what the conditions look like. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2566.28s)]
*  OK, that's precisely the reason why we have been on this coverage for [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2568.2000000000003s)]
*  quite a while, for the past 20 days, as a matter of almost a month. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2573.4s)]
*  But having said that, given the the way that the Western world operates [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2576.32s)]
*  on this stuff, it treats Haaretz's reporting or Israeli reporting with a [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2583.92s)]
*  higher degree of priority, with a higher degree of legitimacy due to the [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2588.64s)]
*  pre-existing Islamophobic attitude that a lot of people unfortunately have. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2592.76s)]
*  This is still important in moving the needle because what is on Haaretz [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2598.52s)]
*  today will inevitably make it to Western media maybe a month from now. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2604.2400000000002s)]
*  OK, that's just how it works. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2610.92s)]
*  It's also always still good to get additional confirmation from the side [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2614.88s)]
*  that is literally shooting, even though the way that the way that Haaretz [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2619.12s)]
*  works here, if you're wondering, like, how does this get past the military [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2626.56s)]
*  censors, for example, or how does this article get reported on? [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2630.12s)]
*  How does article even get any sort of reporting being done if they wanted to [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2634.52s)]
*  stop this, if they want to suppress these communications, they would. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2639.52s)]
*  It's because it serves a secondary purpose. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2642.4s)]
*  It sets the stage to say this was just simply outside of the normal confines [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2644.48s)]
*  of the operation down the line. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2649.56s)]
*  If there's any sort of like war crimes investigation conducted once [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2651.44s)]
*  the dust is settled, OK, it's the same. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2655.12s)]
*  Mohammed Shahada continues says it's the same with apartheid, genocide, [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2658.72s)]
*  starvation, indiscriminate bombing, pogroms. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2661.96s)]

*  makes it sound like it's some breach of protocols rather than a part of an [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2679.3599999999997s)]

*  It, of course, is a part of the deliberate attempt to starve and murder, [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2685.4399999999996s)]
*  mutilate the Palestinian population. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2690.64s)]

*  OK, Mohammed Elkert says, OK, oh, thank God Haaretz [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2698.4399999999996s)]

*  Haaretz? The testimony of Israeli soldiers is somehow more credible and [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2708.96s)]
*  carries more weight than their past. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2711.68s)]
*  Any victims is just good old fashioned racism. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2712.7599999999998s)]
*  You can call a strategy or spin, spin it whichever way you like. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2715.6s)]
*  It's still racist. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2719.16s)]
*  This is true, which is why obviously I place heavy emphasis on Palestinian [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2720.24s)]
*  voices in the process. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2726.08s)]

*  Having said that, however, given that given that there are unimaginably [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2728.96s)]
*  racist people who still refuse to entertain the reality. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2734.56s)]

*  Haaretz a part of the Islamic funded media structure? [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2744.7599999999998s)]
*  Is that what you're saying? [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2747.2s)]
*  This Israeli newspaper that actually confirmed the firsthand testimony of [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2748.2s)]

*  As a matter of fact, that correspond to the testimony of health care workers [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2765.96s)]

*  You say this is the reason why it's still important to show how ours is [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2786.48s)]
*  reporting on it as well. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2790.12s)]
*  That's my point. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2791.16s)]
*  Do you understand? [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2792.08s)]
*  This is a way. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2793.76s)]
*  This is a way to to basically hammer the truth to people who are are maybe in [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2795.48s)]
*  the margins, I mean, even 20 months and one might say it's been 20 months if [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2801.8s)]
*  someone still doesn't get it like them, but that shouldn't discourage you. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2806.76s)]
*  That should not stop you. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2810.76s)]
*  That should not discourage you. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2812.4s)]
*  And it certainly should not stop you from trying to to show people the truth [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2813.72s)]
*  no matter how you can. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2818.16s)]
*  OK. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2820.16s)]
*  And when Harz actually does this kind of journalism, it does inevitably make its [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2821.2799999999997s)]
*  way not to the bylines, but at least like a buried lead in a New York Times report [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2825.24s)]
*  a couple of months later down the line. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2829.52s)]
*  Two are on the ground who've been receiving those instructions and then [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2831.8399999999997s)]
*  carrying it out. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2835.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2836.64s)]
*  Well, I think in the in the Israeli army, as well as the in the Israeli society as [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2836.96s)]
*  all there are some cracks in the in the in the feeling in the understanding of [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2843.8s)]
*  what's going on. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2854.36s)]
*  The way he's describing it is that this is simply a breakdown of operational [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2855.48s)]
*  protocols. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2860.2400000000002s)]
*  It's not it is deliberate. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2861.68s)]
*  It is a deliberate killing field that has been created. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2863.12s)]
*  But the reason why Harz is reporting on this is so that they can turn around and say, [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2866.1600000000003s)]
*  oh, it's just a once again, a simple breakdown of operational procedures. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2870.36s)]
*  I'm not even stop. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2876.76s)]
*  It wasn't it was a minor blip. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2879.96s)]
*  Shut the cup chat. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2881.76s)]
*  Yes, but I'm going to add something critical here. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2883.0s)]
*  Yesterday, the New York Times published an atrocious piece that obfuscated and [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2884.44s)]
*  minimized the deliberate Israeli policy of killing Palestinian aid seekers. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2887.36s)]
*  The way the New York Times soured out in Israeli mentions by quoting the idea of [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2890.6800000000003s)]
*  as saying they shoot warning shots. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2893.68s)]
*  This is meant to leave a gap for continued stated doubt for genocide denialism, where [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2895.44s)]
*  the Palestinians killed by Israelis on purpose or by stray bullets amidst the [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2899.3599999999997s)]
*  chaos. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2903.04s)]
*  Today, Harris dropped a report which should in principle force an end to the [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2903.8399999999997s)]
*  speculation on the intention in the news cover, explicitly name that they were [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2907.68s)]
*  ordered to kill Palestinians and by who will it end the speculation on intention? [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2910.7999999999997s)]
*  No. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2915.6s)]
*  Is it racist that Israeli perpetrators of genocide continue to believe continue to [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2916.3599999999997s)]
*  be believed over their Palestinian victims? [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2921.08s)]
*  Of course, that remains one of the greatest crimes from this. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2922.72s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2927.48s)]
*  The lethal risk of seeking food in Gaza, hundreds of Palestinians have been killed [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2928.24s)]
*  over the past month near eight hubs set up under a new Israel back system, according [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2932.7599999999998s)]
*  to Gaza health officials. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2935.7999999999997s)]
*  This is not an appropriate way to cover the story. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2937.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2941.04s)]
*  This is this is not the truth. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2942.7599999999998s)]
*  It is ridiculous. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2945.52s)]
*  The lethal risk of seeking food in Gaza, like as though there's a naturally occurring [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2946.8399999999997s)]
*  phenomenon that while, you know, Palestinians who are who have been forcibly [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2951.36s)]
*  deprived of food by the Israeli state are desperately seeking out a crumb of aid [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2958.6s)]
*  from said Israeli state that is using the aid delivery mechanism to kill them is the [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2964.92s)]
*  truth. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2971.0s)]
*  Ridiculous. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2971.6800000000003s)]
*  In Gaza. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2972.52s)]
*  By I mean, most of the Israelis, the great majority of the Israelis and the great [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2975.56s)]
*  majority of the of the IDF soldiers as well still believe that the war is in Gaza is [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2980.56s)]
*  just and and the IDF do what he does in Gaza because it's necessary for the security of [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2987.84s)]
*  Israel. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2997.12s)]
*  However, I think in the last few weeks or months or so, there is some cracks in this [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=2998.64s)]
*  in this understanding in this in the Israeli discourse, if you like. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3004.56s)]
*  And and there are more and more people who asking themselves, not only is this war is [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3014.48s)]
*  necessary, but also what is the humanitarian price that the Gaza population is pay for [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3021.4s)]
*  this? [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3028.04s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3028.64s)]
*  Look at these headlines. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3029.2s)]
*  This is how they've covered the the aid distribution scheme that every international aid [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3030.44s)]
*  organization in the United Nations have actually criticized for exactly what this aid [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3035.4s)]
*  distribution scheme looks like. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3042.32s)]
*  The violent means to a violent end with respect to this aid delivery mechanism, this aid [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3043.56s)]
*  delivery scheme that they've cultivated. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3051.0s)]
*  If you ask the New York Times, the lethal risk of seeking food in Gaza, I'll never try [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3053.6s)]
*  again for some guys and seeking aid is just too risky. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3057.92s)]
*  More violence near Gaza aid sites. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3060.7200000000003s)]
*  Friday briefing, the deadly search for food in Gaza. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3063.08s)]
*  It's always it's always just like someone else who knows who's doing it. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3065.8s)]
*  We will never know who's doing it. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3071.08s)]
*  Who's doing it? [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3073.08s)]

*  Like, what do you mean? [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3088.3999999999996s)]
*  What's crazier about this is like every day there is a fresh new hell that we that we [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3089.72s)]
*  watch, OK, happening in real time. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3096.9199999999996s)]
*  There are there are moments from the Holocaust that we could point to where the Nazi Germany [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3099.3999999999996s)]
*  created a sanitized version of a concentration camp and then brought in their affiliate [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3105.8799999999997s)]
*  Red Cross investigators to show the world to lie that this was actually not a a scary [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3112.0s)]
*  concentration camp where people were dying, but the conditions were actually great. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3121.04s)]
*  It was a sanitized I think it was a wasn't a concentration camp. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3123.36s)]
*  It was a ghetto, right? [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3125.92s)]
*  It was a sanitized ghetto. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3126.72s)]
*  OK, we did not have the Internet back then. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3128.04s)]
*  We did not have the Internet back then. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3131.4s)]
*  We do now. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3134.64s)]
*  The fact that they are still the fact that they are still doing this when we know exactly [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3135.7599999999998s)]
*  what's happening, when the victims are directly communicating how it's happening with footage [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3143.04s)]
*  from their phones and the media still goes, well, the Israeli military rejects the report. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3148.72s)]
*  Like they run with that as though the Israeli military statements hold any weight here [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3154.44s)]
*  whatsoever is insane. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3159.64s)]
*  This war. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3162.0s)]
*  Are people do you think near widely widely? [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3163.28s)]
*  Do you think people in Israel are widely cognizant, are widely aware of this instruction to kill [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3166.92s)]
*  civilians? Indeed, some are being killed by snipers, aren't they? [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3174.52s)]
*  We're continually hearing from doctors here in Al Jazeera treating the wounded who talk of [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3177.76s)]
*  people coming in with with headshot wounds or their knees shot out. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3181.96s)]
*  The two we just brought today didn't consider snipers. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3186.44s)]
*  It's actually a practice of, as I as I said, controlling the crowd by fire. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3194.08s)]
*  Like if you wanted the crowd to run off a place, you shoot them at them, even though, you [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3200.36s)]
*  know, they are armed and and and you use fire to move people for one point or another. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3205.84s)]
*  But the question about what Israelis knows or does not know about what's going on in Gaza, I [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3214.72s)]
*  think it's a very good question because the mainstream media in Israel mostly do not deal with [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3221.44s)]
*  what's going on with the Gazan people. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3228.08s)]
*  I mean, they speak about what's going on in Gaza from the from the IDF side, but not about [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3231.72s)]
*  humanitarian issues of of of the war. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3238.2799999999997s)]
*  OK, just just one final question there. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3242.72s)]
*  So I'm sorry to jump in, but we are just running out of time very quickly. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3245.04s)]
*  Where is this coming from? [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3248.52s)]
*  Ultimately, this instruction to kill it must be coming from the very top, isn't it? [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3250.04s)]
*  Yeah, I guess it's come from from pretty tough in in the in the Israeli army. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3255.6s)]
*  We don't know for sure. What are the reasons for the shooting? [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3262.56s)]
*  According to Israel, I haven't ever heard any reasons to try and justify it. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3264.64s)]
*  They say they're communicating with large crowds through gunfire. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3267.6s)]
*  Like that was the that was the official reason, the official unofficial reason. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3272.72s)]
*  They just say it's a lie. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3277.04s)]
*  First of all, they've said their official statement on the report that came from Hards was [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3279.52s)]
*  that this is an abject lie. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3284.2s)]
*  This is blood libel. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3285.4s)]
*  OK, the soldiers justification for it is that they're using gunfire to communicate with the [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3287.2799999999997s)]
*  crowds. The real reason, the actual reason why they're doing this is because they want to kill [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3294.0s)]
*  as many people as possible. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3298.56s)]
*  That's it. The sole purpose of all of these operations is to make the strip uninhabitable [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3300.3199999999997s)]
*  and expedite the process while still while still not reaching a certain point of of [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3306.4399999999996s)]
*  international scrutiny that should have come a long time ago, of course, but expedite the [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3314.56s)]
*  process of ethnic cleansing. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3319.0s)]
*  We don't have the name of the officer who decide to use that method to control the people. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3320.9599999999996s)]
*  But it's it's have to be pretty high in the in the commensurate. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3329.2000000000003s)]
*  All right, thanks for joining us here in Algeria. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3333.6s)]
*  We'll leave it there. That's Nehra son from Herat speaking to us here in Algeria. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3335.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QWATt8Cw&t=3338.6800000000003s)]
