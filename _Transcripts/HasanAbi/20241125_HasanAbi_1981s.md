# This Is So Wrong | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [November 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw)
*  And also, it literally confirms everything Trump has been saying. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=0.0s)]
*  Like, there has never been a better moment to be a Trump supporter than this moment. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=4.8s)]
*  Every single thing that he said about like, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=8.6s)]
*  these Dems are coming after me doing ****, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  you're basically admitting you don't have any interest in preserving the institutions [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=14.0s)]
*  or the rule of law if you're going to be like, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=19.2s)]
*  well, I guess we can't do anything because you're the president now. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=20.8s)]
*  That's it. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=23.6s)]
*  On the air with breaking news about President-elect Donald Trump, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=30.0s)]
*  the Justice Department Special Counsel Jack Smith just filed a motion to dismiss [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=33.4s)]
*  the federal criminal case against the president-elect over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=39.2s)]
*  The news comes after NBC News learned the Justice Department had been planning to wind down its federal cases against Mr. Trump. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=46.4s)]
*  It also comes as NBC News learned that... [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=55.0s)]
*  Lamont Drake apparently donated to ACP. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=58.0s)]
*  Get the **** out of here. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=60.0s)]
*  No, he didn't. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=61.0s)]
*  But Drake is also not a good time to recognize or admit this, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=61.8s)]
*  but he has been one of the most prominent artists out there that has actually, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=66.8s)]
*  that has actually openly been pro-Palestine early on. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=73.4s)]
*  Smith and his team plan to resign. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=77.2s)]
*  Ultra, ultra rare Drake W. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=79.0s)]
*  Before Mr. Trump returns to the White House, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=81.2s)]
*  we want to go straight to our Justice and Intelligence correspondent, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=84.4s)]
*  Ken Delaney and Ken Phyllis in here. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=87.8s)]
*  Lester Special Counsel Jack Smith and his team have filed a sparse but historic document here asking Judge Tonya Chutkin to dismiss this case. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=89.8s)]
*  And the grounds they gave is essentially that the Justice Department has always held historically that a sitting president can't be prosecuted or indicted, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=99.2s)]
*  and that that principle applies here. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=109.0s)]
*  Let me just read a little bit from what... [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=111.0s)]
*  Now they won't even let Trump fire them. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=112.8s)]
*  They're surrendering and Trump takes a victory lap without suffering a bad news cycle. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=114.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=119.0s)]
*  And also it literally confirms everything Trump has been saying. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=119.8s)]
*  Like there has never been a better moment to be a Trump supporter than this moment. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=124.39999999999999s)]
*  Every single thing that he said about like these Dems are coming after me doing ****, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=128.6s)]
*  you're basically admitting you don't have any interest in preserving the institutions or the rule of law. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=133.6s)]
*  If you're going to be like, well, I guess we can't do anything because you're the president now. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=139.6s)]
*  That's it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=143.6s)]
*  Complete utter humiliating defeat for all of these institutional, all of these institution defenders, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=144.6s)]
*  these lovers of institutions. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  Once again, the damage that this will do, the damage that this will personally do if the Democrats actually did care about preserving the integrity of these institutions, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=154.2s)]
*  the damage that this act does to the validity and the legitimacy of those institutions are insurmountable. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=164.4s)]
*  It's completely just throw it away. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=171.0s)]
*  It's like Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski going down the Mar-a-Lago to kiss Trump's ring after eight years of calling him a ****. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=174.0s)]
*  Then you didn't believe it at all. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=183.0s)]
*  You didn't believe that he was a **** at all. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=184.8s)]
*  You were just lying. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=187.20000000000002s)]
*  It's like when Democrats turn around and say like, yeah, you know what? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=188.4s)]
*  Immigrants are actually bad. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=192.6s)]
*  We got to do the border ourselves after calling Republicans racist for four, five, six, seven years. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=193.8s)]
*  Okay, I guess you admit it then. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=200.20000000000002s)]
*  You're just a liar. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=202.0s)]
*  You don't give a ****. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  Huh? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=205.60000000000002s)]
*  In light of this, what are your opinions on leftist voting third party this year and letting this guy do this damage? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=206.20000000000002s)]
*  I understand why some leftist, but this is a bad president for Trump to set. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=210.60000000000002s)]
*  If you think this is the fault of like random people who voted third party, who Kamala Harris lost by such wide margins that like their votes were inconsequential, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=213.8s)]
*  regardless, you are stupid. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=223.0s)]
*  Okay, there is no better way to put it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=225.2s)]
*  You are watching Democrats in key positions right now taking a knee and genuflecting to this **** piece of **** and you're still like, you know, who's at fault here? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=227.2s)]
*  Random third party voters actually, who if they all voted for the Democrats would have still not allowed the Democratic Party to **** win. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=238.9s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=248.1s)]
*  What the ****? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=249.5s)]
*  You cannot outflank the Democratic Party. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=250.6s)]
*  You cannot make the assertion that these people are automatically in the tank for the Democratic Party, but are silly and selfish. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=254.0s)]
*  And that's why they're not voting for the Democrats. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=261.2s)]
*  This is an idiotic way to campaign. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=263.4s)]
*  Okay, that's not how this works. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=265.3s)]
*  And what's happening right now is far far far more consequential. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=267.8s)]
*  People need to cut this **** out. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=272.2s)]
*  Okay, stop. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=273.8s)]
*  Do you work for the DNC? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=275.4s)]
*  Do you have pay stubs to show for it? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=277.2s)]
*  Why are you defending their inadequacy for free on an independent outlet such as myself? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=279.4s)]
*  Okay, you're coming to a community of leftists to be like, I am going to defend the $700,000 salary-winning, idiotic analysts and campaign staffers that literally openly consulted the Democratic Party to lose. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=287.09999999999997s)]
*  I'm going to defend them and their integrity. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=305.7s)]
*  It's like these guys have, you guys can pay six figures. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=308.1s)]
*  They melted a billion dollars. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=310.6s)]
*  They were $30 million in debt by the end of this campaign and they lost. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=312.6s)]
*  It's so dumb. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=319.90000000000003s)]
*  Stop. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=321.20000000000005s)]
*  Stop playing. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=322.6s)]
*  Stop. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=323.8s)]
*  Stop being a mark. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=324.20000000000005s)]
*  Okay, please. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=326.40000000000003s)]
*  I beg of you. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=327.20000000000005s)]
*  Stop being a sucker. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=328.20000000000005s)]
*  Stop being a sucker for those who are in positions of power within the Democratic Party. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=329.70000000000005s)]
*  You are literally doing their bidding. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=334.90000000000003s)]
*  You are refusing to recognize the truth and you are allowing the Democrats to continue building this narrative that it was actually some random leftist that caused the Democrats to lose. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=337.1s)]
*  Again, these people are defending the DNC when Trump has not even gotten in the power because they are worried of any transformation to the Democratic Party or growing efforts to leave the party as a whole. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=350.1s)]
*  I really want to see what Bernie and his organizations are doing, going to do soon. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=358.3s)]
*  They're planning something. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=362.1s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=362.90000000000003s)]
*  What they wrote. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=363.8s)]
*  I got to pee. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=365.1s)]
*  They said that the Department and the country have never faced the circumstance here where a federal indictment against a private citizen has been returned by a grand jury and a criminal prosecution is already underway when the defendant is elected president. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=365.8s)]
*  Confronted with this unprecedented situation, the special counsel's office consulted with the Department's Office of Legal Counsel. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=378.5s)]
*  That's the group inside the DOJ that decides constitutional legal positions. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=385.1s)]
*  And then they said that after careful consideration, the Justice Department has determined that the OLC's prior opinions concerning the Constitution's prohibition on federal indictment and prosecution of a sitting president apply to this situation. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=389.8s)]
*  Lester. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=403.7s)]
*  So look, this indictment, this involves the three conspiracies Donald Trump is accused of in an effort to cling to power after the 2020 election. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=404.0s)]
*  And it marked an extraordinary moment in American history. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=412.5s)]
*  This is the first ever accusation that a sitting president committed crimes in an effort to cling to power. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=415.0s)]
*  The dismissal also marks an extraordinary moment. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=421.0s)]
*  Fifty years after Richard Nixon was forced by lawmakers from both parties to resign the presidency amid allegations of criminal conduct, half of American voters discounted equally serious charges of criminal misconduct in office against Donald Trump. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=423.7s)]
*  They returned Mr. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=437.79999999999995s)]
*  Trump to the presidency. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=438.5s)]
*  And if the lesson of Watergate was that no one was above the law, the lesson of the Trump era is that a majority of Americans have decided that this principle no longer applies. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=439.8s)]
*  And what I can tell you, Lester, is that we also expect a filing in the other case, which has been dismissed by the judge, that classified documents case against Mr. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=449.7s)]
*  Trump, which is on appeal. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=458.3s)]
*  We expect a filing there, although it's not clear exactly what that filing will say, because there are two other defendants in that case. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=460.2s)]
*  And Jack Smith, the special counsel, is required to file a report to the attorney general before he leaves office explaining his prosecution decisions. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=466.9s)]
*  Wouldn't it be wrong to try and jail and pull to court an upcoming president though, because it internally weakens the country? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=477.09999999999997s)]
*  Some things are more important than partisan fighting. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=482.3s)]
*  Brother, you either think Trump is a f**king threat to American democracy and is a f**king die in the wool f**kers, or you just lied about it for years. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=484.7s)]
*  I personally think he is. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=492.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=494.4s)]
*  I think he does spell great trouble for American democracy and the future of America in general. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=495.0s)]
*  And he is a f**king straightforward, ultra nationalist fascist at this point. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=499.9s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=505.4s)]
*  Doesn't matter if he's like personally invested in some ideological variant of f**king ideology. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=505.9s)]
*  What matters is his output. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=512.4s)]
*  What matters is what he is doing. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=513.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=515.4s)]
*  He violated the rules regardless. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=516.0s)]
*  Why the f**k would you cast that aside? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=518.5s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=520.6s)]
*  We need to make sure that Germany is united. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=521.5s)]
*  And that's precisely the reason why we should offer Hitler the chancellor position because ultimately, you know, it's better to have a united Germany. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=524.1s)]
*  Yeah, see how well that worked. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=534.4s)]

*  Laura, what is the chance putting politics aside? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=666.1s)]
*  What's the chance of a resuming the case for years? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=668.4s)]
*  About very little you and I both noted as the filing was coming in that it said without prejudice, which means theoretically they could bring it again, but it seems highly unlikely Lester even notwithstanding statute of limitations issues all the effort and resources that were put into this. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=671.0s)]
*  They never really got off the ground. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=685.9s)]
*  They didn't get anywhere close to a jury trial much less the conclusion and sentencing. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=687.6999999999999s)]
*  They just never got there. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=692.4s)]
*  But between the delays with the Supreme Court decision on immunity and Trump's own efforts to try to get the case blocked. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=693.6999999999999s)]
*  I think the real question now is just whether we even see a final report from Smith's office laying out sort of what evidence he would have induced at trial. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=699.9s)]
*  He was also required to explain in that report why he didn't bring any charges if there were anything anything that he held back. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=707.8s)]
*  He's supposed to explain. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=714.3s)]
*  He had already developed a roadmap to get around the Supreme Court ruling on immunity. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=715.0s)]
*  He had tried and they did a superseding indictment search essentially rewriting the indictment to be more in line with that kept out some of the evidence that the Supreme Court said was off limits. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=718.9000000000001s)]
*  But even still he was at the beginning stages of that Trump was likely to appeal even that new indictment. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=728.5s)]
*  And so we just really never got off the ground. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=734.1s)]
*  So the facts didn't change. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=736.4000000000001s)]
*  The evidence didn't change. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=737.5s)]

*  The president-elect announced a series of top administration picks just over the weekend including hedge fund manager Scott Besson to be Treasury Secretary and Congresswoman Lori Chavez de Rimer as Labor Secretary. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=745.7s)]
*  Trump needed less than three weeks to pick his cabinet. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=757.2s)]
*  But some of his more controversial picks may have trouble getting approved by the Senate. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=760.1s)]

*  Now that President-elect Trump has made most of his key picks. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=771.4s)]
*  There are new calls for them to get FBI background checks. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=774.7s)]
*  But overall the public is giving him positive marks. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=778.1s)]
*  As president-elect Donald Trump at the finishing touches on his cabinet choices this weekend a new CBS News poll finds 59% of Americans approve of how he's handling the transition. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=781.3000000000001s)]
*  We're going to have hearings early so we can get his team in place when he takes the oath of office on January 20th. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=792.5s)]
*  The poll also shows many of Trump's designees have more support than opposition. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=798.9000000000001s)]
*  That includes some of his more controversial picks like Robert F Kennedy Jr. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=804.0s)]
*  for Health and Human Services, Tulsi Gabbard for Director of National Intelligence. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=808.5s)]
*  There's a major disconnect where reality is country. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=813.0s)]
*  I can't everything is bad and only slated to get worse. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=815.2s)]
*  Do you understand like everything is bad and it's only going to get worse and there is I feel like there are not enough people that are actively speaking out against how insane things are getting. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=818.8s)]
*  And only until people are staring down the the actual ever-present danger of Trump's fascist white nativist anti-immigrant policies and how devastating that is for the lives of millions of Americans. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=832.9000000000001s)]
*  Will they turn around and go oh man we fucked up and at that point it'll be far too late. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=850.3000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=857.2s)]
*  Pete Hegseth for Defense, although some voters say they still haven't heard enough. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=858.4000000000001s)]
*  I'm a yes on Pete Hegseth. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=863.9000000000001s)]
*  I'm a yes on Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=865.4000000000001s)]
*  While some GOP senators say they'll vote for the picks Democrats like Illinois's Tammy Duckworth raise concerns about a sexual assault allegation against Hegseth, which he has denied and his comments that women shouldn't serve in combat. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=866.9000000000001s)]
*  He's just flat out wrong. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=881.9000000000001s)]
*  Our military could not go to war without the women who wear this uniform. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=883.6s)]
*  She also called Gabbard who at times has been seen as sympathetic to Russia and Syria compromised. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=887.4000000000001s)]
*  She is a true patriot of the United States and there's no reason why the Democrats are going after her other than the fact they're upset that she left their woke party. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=893.7s)]
*  Some lawmakers insist nominees must go through FBI background checks, but the Trump transition has not signed an agreement with the agency to start the vetting process. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=902.2s)]
*  If they keep delaying on these background checks, we will have a delay in getting these cabinet officials in. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=912.4s)]
*  I don't think the American public cares who does the background checks. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=918.4s)]
*  What the American public cares about is to see the mandate that they voted in delivered upon. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=921.1999999999999s)]
*  The Trump transition also hasn't signed an agreement with the White House to get access to office space or help with expenses. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=925.5999999999999s)]

*  He is a hedge fund manager and former Democratic Party donor who now advocates for big cuts to the federal budget and much more oil production in the U.S. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=973.1999999999999s)]
*  and for the powerful position of director of the OMB, the Office of Management and Budget Russell Vogt. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=982.3s)]
*  He held that post in the first Trump administration and he is also the lead author, one of the lead authors of Project 2025. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=987.6999999999999s)]
*  That's that controversial blueprint for a second Trump administration that Trump distanced himself from during the campaign [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=995.4s)]
*  but has now put one of the top architects at the very center of power and for Labor Secretary, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1001.5s)]
*  Republican Congresswoman from Oregon, Lori Chavez de Raimer. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1006.5s)]

*  Rebecca? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1014.0s)]
*  Yeah, you said it, Terry. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1014.6s)]
*  Very ideologically diverse and there are also more controversial nominees in the public health posts. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1015.6s)]
*  No question about it, Rebecca. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1021.3s)]
*  There's a real theme here. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1022.8s)]
*  Trump has named former Florida Congressman Dave Weldon, who is a real vaccine skeptic to run the CDC, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1024.0s)]

*  It's to ensure it's to ensure that these guys are are not going to get any sort of like foreign interference or anything [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1098.7s)]
*  like that and they won't be blackmailed. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1107.6s)]
*  You have to do this kind of due diligence if you do care about, I guess. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1109.8999999999999s)]
*  At least having a competent cabinet, but Trump doesn't care about that at all. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1114.5s)]
*  But then again, then again, the reality of the matter is you're like we're in a new era. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1119.3s)]
*  We're in a new era where I think it doesn't really matter. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1125.1s)]
*  I mean, look at Pete Hegseth. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1130.1999999999998s)]
*  Dude's a fucking rapist and people still are like, nah, that's my rapist dog. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1132.1999999999998s)]
*  I love him. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1136.3999999999999s)]
*  He should be in charge of the Department of Defense. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1137.2s)]
*  So I feel like maybe blackmail doesn't work if you're shameless, you know, when we have when there is no when I guess it [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1140.3s)]
*  when the the way that society analyzes views these people as like when they when they say them as like when they see them [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1150.0s)]
*  as like fine individuals, regardless of what they've done. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1161.0s)]
*  I think maybe blackmail is inconsequential when there's no shame and no accountability whatsoever. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1164.2s)]
*  Democrats very real struggle right now. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1170.5s)]
*  They ought to be thinking about the meaning of their party right now. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1173.6s)]
*  That party had stood I think on three pillars. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1177.8s)]
*  One it was the party of the little guy. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1181.2s)]
*  The other is that the party it was the party of anti-war. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1184.0s)]
*  The other is it was the party of very generous spending. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1188.5s)]
*  But the Trump old old Peggy drunk by Noonan. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1192.8999999999999s)]
*  That's funny being Republican Party has taken those issues at least for now. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1196.3s)]
*  So let's bring in Democratic, Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman, sir. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1202.8s)]
*  Very excited to talk to you. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1205.8999999999999s)]
*  Thank you for jumping in when Senator Barrasso's feed has gone down on short notice. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1207.1s)]
*  Noonan there offers the perspective that the Trump GOP has sort of usurp some of the [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1212.0s)]
*  founding cornerstone pillars of the Democratic Party. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1218.0s)]
*  Do you think she has a point? [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1222.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1223.4s)]
*  Well one one area where where we kind of lost ourselves with the border and I've been on on this network, you know, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1223.6s)]
*  months months ago saying hey, you know, it can't be controversial for our party to have be pro-immigration. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1231.2s)]
*  But we need a secure border. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1239.2s)]
*  And when we ask or demand people to not believe what they see and see those kind of numbers that that's not [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1240.9s)]
*  It's pretty it's pretty funny that like this is the guy spearheading the the right-wing shift of the party. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1247.6000000000001s)]
*  The person that is the person that is the the most effective communicator of the right-wing shift of the party is a guy who can't [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1256.4s)]
*  communicate at all. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1263.4s)]
*  Just dumb as fucking bricks. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1264.4s)]
*  Just a straightforward ogre. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1266.0s)]
*  Not a problem. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1267.7s)]
*  It's like well the party is so cooked. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1268.6000000000001s)]
*  Then you lose about that a hundred percent. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1270.9s)]
*  I've tried to describe it's you have up to 300,000 people encounters per month and I put that in perspective with [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1273.6000000000001s)]
*  Pennsylvania. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1281.1000000000001s)]
*  I'm like that's that's the size of Pittsburgh showing up in one month. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1281.8000000000002s)]
*  It's like what's going to happen for those folks if we want them the American dream for those people. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1285.0s)]
*  How can we possibly deliver that? [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1290.1000000000001s)]
*  Where do they go? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1291.8000000000002s)]
*  And we can't pretend that that's not a significant issue and we got to address that. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1292.9s)]
*  So another is not the new Joe Manchin. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1297.3000000000002s)]
*  I think the party itself is reshaping itself in this in this attitude. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1300.8s)]
*  That's what I'm trying to explain. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1306.0s)]
*  She like that. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1307.5s)]
*  I don't it would he Joe Manchin played the role of a spoiler but at least the party back then would try to present [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1308.1000000000001s)]
*  itself as like somewhat progressive someone on the side of working-class people that that cared about the truth with [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1317.0s)]
*  respect to like, you know, immigration. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1324.1000000000001s)]
*  Now the party is saying like now we're we're becoming the Joe Manchin party. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1327.1999999999998s)]
*  We're becoming the John Fetterman party. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1331.3999999999999s)]
*  It's really insane to watch happen in real time. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1333.3999999999999s)]
*  I don't think that's about endless Wars. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1338.8s)]
*  I think they're two very just Wars. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1341.0s)]
*  I think Israel for example, that's a very just one and now I've never supported a ceasefire and that was the right [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1343.8s)]
*  thing. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1350.6s)]
*  I said I was going to follow Israel and since they refuse to have that ceasefire they have eliminated [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1350.8999999999999s)]
*  and broken Hamas and Hezbollah Hezbollah was supposed to be like the ultimate badass in the Middle East and now [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1357.0s)]
*  they were just a bunch of Keystone. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1363.9s)]
*  Yet. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1365.6s)]
*  I mean, like I said, John Fetterman not exactly not exactly known for having a good functioning brain really [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1367.7s)]
*  cool that the brain damage guy is the guy that is communicating the the right-wing shift of the Democratic Party. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1377.1s)]
*  It is it is pretty it is pretty funny that he's saying this when you know objectively untrue Israel is at a hard time [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1384.3s)]
*  even bringing Hamas to heal inside of Gaza, which is supposed to be Israel's playground to begin with a area that I [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1392.1000000000001s)]
*  have full sovereignty over and they still have not been able to take out a militant resistance group and they [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1400.2s)]
*  certainly have not had such a good time with Hezbollah and Lebanon and Iran. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1407.0s)]
*  But it's wild to say this in the in the eve of the the like in the immediate aftermath of the ICC coming out and being [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1413.1s)]
*  like, yeah, Benjamin Netanyahu is a war criminal for mass starvation utilizing starvation as a weapon and the [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1421.4s)]
*  defense minister former defense minister. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1426.5s)]
*  You have Golan is also a war criminal as well. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1428.8s)]
*  Like he is just like, yeah, I don't care. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1431.3s)]
*  Israel good all of Israel enemies bad. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1434.6s)]
*  I'm glad they never did ceasefire. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1438.4s)]
*  Would Federman hit that rare title of left grifter brother? [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1441.8s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1445.0s)]
*  No, of course. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1446.3999999999999s)]
*  Do you feel like he's grifting to the left when he says this? [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1448.0s)]
*  No, it's the exact opposite. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1451.3999999999999s)]
*  It's people that fucking claim that their left is that then turn right wing immediately when they get power bros. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1453.3s)]
*  One of the most right-wing fucking senators out there in the Democratic Party. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1459.5s)]
*  He got brain damage and immediately became a omega reactionary has been exposed. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1463.2s)]
*  It's just you know about anything. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1470.7s)]
*  So that's been a significant development here. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1472.7s)]
*  And now also I'd like to point out Israel had blown up their nuclear weapons lab as part of that too. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1476.1000000000001s)]
*  So and with respects for Ukraine, Ukraine was invaded and on for me for me, it's about standing on the side of [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1481.8s)]
*  democracy and I was very supportive about that aid and I don't understand if the other side would now stop delivering [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1489.6000000000001s)]
*  that kind of aid. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1497.3s)]
*  That's a that's a disagreement, but I've been very very clear supporting is Israel. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1498.8999999999999s)]
*  He ran a pretty progressive. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1503.7s)]
*  He ran a pretty progressive Democratic campaign. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1505.6s)]
*  He ran he ran a progressive campaign and immediately, you know, it's like Richie Torres. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1508.3999999999999s)]
*  He ran a progressive campaign and immediately swapped it like so did Chris Kiersten cinema didn't run a progressive campaign [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1514.8999999999999s)]
*  but like became increasingly more centrist in the process increasingly more right-wing in the process. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1521.3999999999999s)]
*  It's the endless. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1527.0s)]
*  It's the endless grift of constantly constantly fucking grifting to the right. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1528.2s)]
*  If he was a left-wing grifter, he would have you know become more left-wing. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1535.5s)]
*  I guess despite not believing in it like it's not a real thing. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1540.0s)]
*  There is no there is no real grifting to the left because there's no money on the left. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1543.4s)]
*  There are people on the left. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1550.4s)]
*  So you might present yourself as more progressive if you want to win an election. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1553.3s)]
*  Okay, having said that however, there is no there is no money there. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1557.8999999999999s)]
*  So there is no reason to just like actually go further and further to the left. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1563.6s)]
*  Once you actually win power, I think his brain damage because he was a progressive Democrat in 2016 when Bernie endorse him for LT. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1568.0s)]
*  He was shitting on moderate. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1574.8999999999999s)]
*  Dems very unusual. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1575.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, no, I think his situation is genuine. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1577.0s)]
*  I don't even think he's a grifter. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1579.5s)]
*  I think he just actively got brain damaged into becoming more conservative like that that that flip especially for Israel. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1581.3s)]
*  He was always John Fetterman was always bad on Israel. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1591.7s)]
*  Okay, but not this bad never this bad and not only that but also his wife is an undocumented immigrant like was an undocumented immigrant. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1594.8999999999999s)]
*  He was always pro immigrant pro gay pro weed all this shit like he was he was definitely there are times [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1604.7s)]
*  when he actually fucking was in support of banning fracking even though he's like the fucking Western Pennsylvania ogre that looks like this. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1610.7s)]
*  He went back and forth on fracking as well. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1619.5s)]
*  Pro gay weed. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1621.9s)]
*  Yeah, really in Ukraine you have sir. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1622.8s)]
*  And while you're on the topic of Israel your colleagues voted down this Bernie Sanders bill this week to stop supplying weapons to Israel. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1625.7s)]
*  The new incoming administration is touting their foreign policy national security team as the most pro-Israel and modern history wondering if you agree with that. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1635.6999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1646.3s)]
*  Well, I mean it was it was a pleasure to vote a big no on on all those threes with my colleague from Vermont. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1646.8999999999999s)]
*  I don't understand why anybody would bring that to the floor. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgR-ofs-qdw&t=1654.0s)]
