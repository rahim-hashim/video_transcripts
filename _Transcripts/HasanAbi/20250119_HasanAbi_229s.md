**HasanAbi:** [January 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSAdEiNZ6j0)
*  basically as a child like separated from the rest of the clan and you'll see you'll see if you watch it, but it's incredible. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSAdEiNZ6j0&t=0.0s)]
*  It's actually incredible. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSAdEiNZ6j0&t=7.4s)]
*  It made me it made me so sad. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSAdEiNZ6j0&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  It made me so sad and it got me so excited virtually every episode and not only that but also so far every episode. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSAdEiNZ6j0&t=12.9s)]
*  I watched like the first 10 episodes or the first like eight episodes and it's amazing. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSAdEiNZ6j0&t=22.1s)]

*  It's so sad. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSAdEiNZ6j0&t=34.6s)]
*  It made me like it made me tear up every single episode so far and it's not normally the type of anime that I would ever watch or enjoy but it's so well drawn. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSAdEiNZ6j0&t=36.1s)]
*  It's the story of a deaf and mute prince who's slated to be the king as the king is dying. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSAdEiNZ6j0&t=49.5s)]
*  There's a concept of like this divine like God figure that comes down like like an emissary of the God comes down and ranks Kings. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSAdEiNZ6j0&t=56.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSAdEiNZ6j0&t=64.7s)]
*  And when you're at the top of the rank you get like, I don't know access to the King's heavenly bounty or the God's heavenly bounty and you pick something. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSAdEiNZ6j0&t=65.1s)]
*  Okay, who recommended to you randomly found it? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSAdEiNZ6j0&t=73.7s)]
*  I have nothing to do. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSAdEiNZ6j0&t=79.4s)]
*  You are forgotten. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSAdEiNZ6j0&t=80.92s)]
*  Cut out and eight. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSAdEiNZ6j0&t=82.0s)]
*  Forzing your ass. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSAdEiNZ6j0&t=85.0s)]
*  sign him. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSAdEiNZ6j0&t=90.4s)]
*  Sudden Black is consequences. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSAdEiNZ6j0&t=91.8s)]
*  You're famous. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSAdEiNZ6j0&t=93.7s)]
*  Bush, it's a it's a deaf and mute if a deaf and mute print sling that gets his you know, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSAdEiNZ6j0&t=95.7s)]
*  a new, a Prince Ling that gets his, you know, Prince status ripped away from him from the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSAdEiNZ6j0&t=99.4s)]
*  second from his like younger brother. And he develops a relationship with this shadow [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSAdEiNZ6j0&t=106.10000000000001s)]
*  figure. He develops a relationship with a shadow figure called Kage who is from a clan [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSAdEiNZ6j0&t=112.56s)]
*  of assassins that are, that are basically like linked up with whatever King that they, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSAdEiNZ6j0&t=118.88000000000001s)]
*  demonstrate loyalty to, but there's some controversy in their background. I'm not spoiling it. I'm [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSAdEiNZ6j0&t=126.75999999999999s)]
*  just giving you some background. There's controversy in the background. Anyway, Kage is basically [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSAdEiNZ6j0&t=132.16s)]
*  as a child, like separated from the rest of the clan. And you'll see, you'll see if you [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSAdEiNZ6j0&t=136.32s)]
*  watch it, but it's incredible. It's actually incredible. It made me, it made me so sad. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSAdEiNZ6j0&t=141.56s)]
*  It made me so sad and it got me so excited virtually every episode. And not only that, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSAdEiNZ6j0&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  but also so far, every episode has been incredible emotional journey. And, and not only that, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSAdEiNZ6j0&t=155.2s)]
*  but also all of the characters are not like immediately evil or immediately good. Like [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSAdEiNZ6j0&t=162.72s)]
*  that's something that I also appreciate. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSAdEiNZ6j0&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  Cause a lot of animes have one dimensional characters, people who are just like good [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSAdEiNZ6j0&t=170.64s)]
*  or bad. And in ranking of Kings, a lot of the characters have like different motivations [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSAdEiNZ6j0&t=175.07999999999998s)]
*  that might surprise you down the line. That type of, that type of situation is something [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSAdEiNZ6j0&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  that I do appreciate. It's good. It's good writing. Anyway, so that's, I love the art [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSAdEiNZ6j0&t=186.0s)]
*  style as well. It's incredible. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSAdEiNZ6j0&t=190.51999999999998s)]
*  Anyway, have you watched Mob Psycho? Yes, Mobo, of course. So that, that's a great anime [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSAdEiNZ6j0&t=193.52s)]
*  I've been watching. Recommend it really like it anyway. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSAdEiNZ6j0&t=217.44s)]
