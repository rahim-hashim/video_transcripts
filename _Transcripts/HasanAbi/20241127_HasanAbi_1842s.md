# Harris Team Breaks Silence After Campaign Loss | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [November 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8)
*  The idea that like the Kamala Harris campaign was too scared of a bunch of the low level staffers who were like, No, don't do it. Joe Rogan is not woke. It's just trying to reframe a very similar narrative that it's the young wokes that are ruining the party. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=0.0s)]
*  Wow. The Kamala Harris staffers were only focused on Joe Rogan. They had to listen to their youthful staffers on whether or not they should go on the Joe Rogan podcast. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=15.0s)]
*  Harris and Tim Walls urging their supporters to keep up the fight on a call with grassroots organizers yesterday. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=30.0s)]
*  I know this is an uncertain time. Yeah. Lee Zeldin is saying it's like pro Palestine theme messages. We'll we'll see more. I'm clear eyed about that. We'll learn more about it soon. And it feels heavy. And I just have to remind you. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=36.0s)]
*  Don't you ever let anybody take your power from you. You have the same power that you did before November 5th. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=52.0s)]
*  Three weeks after losing the election, Harris's team is speaking out for the first time in a wide ranging interview with Pod Save America's Dan Pfeiffer, former senior advisor to Barack Obama. Four senior members of the Harris campaign discussed what they think went wrong. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=60.0s)]
*  One major hurdle, they say. They only had 107 days and they say that impacted decisions like the number of interviews she could do. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=73.0s)]
*  Trump, on the other hand, of course, made it part of his campaign to appear across several popular podcasts. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=80.0s)]
*  One of the things I like about doing a show like this. Can you imagine Kamala doing this show? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=85.0s)]
*  I could imagine her doing this show. She would be laying on the floor. She was supposed to do it and she might still do it. And I hope she does. She's not going to do it. I will talk to her like a human being. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=90.0s)]
*  I would try to have a conversation with her. If she did this kind of an interview with you, I hope she does because it would be a mess. She'd be laying on the floor. Kamala would be saying, call in the medics. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=99.0s)]
*  Harris's team addressed whether she should have gone on Joe Rogan's podcast and tried to explain why it never happened. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=109.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of intrigue around this. A lot of theory. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=115.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. While I do think it would have improved their chances, I don't think that it would have changed the outcome. Having said that, however, this level of emphasis on a singular podcast is yet another resounding example that we have devolved as a society. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=119.0s)]
*  Okay, we have devolved spectacularly. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=137.0s)]
*  It's pretty simple. We wanted to do it. We had discussions with Joe Rogan's team. They were great. They wanted us to come on. We wanted to come on. We tried to get a date to make it work and ultimately we just weren't able to find a date. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=141.0s)]
*  But it didn't ultimately impact the outcome one way or the other. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=156.0s)]
*  They say they just couldn't find a date and that they don't think it would have impacted the outcome one way or the other. James Carville weighed in on this question in recent days. Let's watch what he had to say. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=160.0s)]
*  The vice president was thinking about going on Joe Rogan's show and a lot of the younger progressive staffers pitched a hissy fit. If I were running a 20-28 campus... [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=172.0s)]
*  Dude, this argument is so dumb. Oh, really? Oh, so you listened to your younger staffers about Joe Rogan, but you didn't listen to your younger staffers about Israel-Palestine? I wonder what was more consequential for the election. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=184.0s)]
*  I don't believe this even for a second. Okay, f**k this lizard. That's a From Software common enemy? Yes, that is James Carville, a From Software common enemy. You are right. Yeah, get the f**k out of here, dude. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=200.0s)]
*  Oh, they didn't listen to their staffers. They're so scared of their staffers. No, the f**k they're not. You're just lying. I hate this nonsense. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=211.0s)]
*  campaign and I had some little snot-nosed 23-year-old saying I'm going to resign if you don't do this. Not only would I fire that f**k on the spot, I would find out who hired them and fire that person on the spot. I'm really not interested in your uninformed f**king opinion as to whether you go on Joe Rogan or not. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=219.0s)]
*  Okay, so Haima, you have the impression. This is the classic Reddit conundrum of just like operating on a false premise. And then, you know, fantasizing about what you would do under that false premise. Like just that's it. It's not real. This is not a real thing. Okay. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=241.0s)]
*  The idea that like the Kamala Harris campaign was too scared of a bunch of the f**king low level staffers who were like, no, don't do it. Joe Rogan is not woke. It's just trying to reframe a very similar narrative that it's the young wokes that are ruining the party. Wow. The Kamala Harris staffers were only focused on Joe Rogan. They had to listen to their youthful staffers on whether or not they should go on the Joe Rogan podcast, but had no problems not listening to them on any number of different things. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=256.0s)]
*  Like f**king, you know, changing trajectory on the ongoing j**t side in Gaza. Feelings on Coca-Cola now being BDS. I've already covered this in the morning. I'm heartbroken, but hey, I will, you know, if this is a successful pressure campaign against Coca-Cola, then I'm all for it. You know, I will abide by it. I have talked about my opinions on boycotting and consumer based activism and the Palestinian National Council boycott divestiture. I'm not going to go into that. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=285.0s)]
*  And the Palestinian National Council boycott divestiture and sanctions is like a perfect example of a hyper targeted, very specific, very deliberate pressure campaign is exactly what is good. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=312.0s)]
*  What did go wrong? Yeah, look, I hate these postmortems. I might not have been talking about this, and this is going to go on for weeks and weeks and weeks. There were a myriad of things that happened over the course of the last four years and even eight years that led to what happened on November 5th. Look, two things that stand out to me. I think I think my friends on the Kamala campaign are correct. 107 days is not enough time to run for president. That's just a f**king lie. I think that's a f**king lie. I think that's a f**king lie. I think that's a f**king lie. I think that's a f**king lie. I think that's a f**king lie. I think that's a f**king lie. I think that's a f**king lie. I think that's a f**king lie. I think that's a f**king lie. I think that's a f**king lie. I think that's a [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=324.0s)]
*  fact. And on the other side, Donald Trump has now run three times. This is the third Democratic nominee that he's run against. So Donald Trump has run for president three times. He's been able to seed his messaging a lot more strongly than any of our candidates have been because we've switched over each of the three times. And so I do believe that Vice President Harris ran a tremendous campaign. And I think she was as good of a candidate as she could have been. Now granted, let's pull back to the layers a little bit. Should she have done Joe Rogan? Yes, she should have. Would it have changed the election? Probably not. And that's [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=354.0s)]
*  so I think, and I'm gonna sell something that Mike and I were talking about in Mario during the green room. I think here's the overarching thing. You've got to meet voters where they are. You can't try to lead them to where you want them to go. And I think time and time again, Democrats, and particularly this past campaign, we were trying to lead a high minded campaign and talk about issues that we thought were important to people, but come to find out that's not what people want to talk about. People want to talk about immigration. They want to feel safe. They want to talk about inflation. And look, all these numbers that you know, these indicators today seem to be doing [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=384.0s)]
*  better right now. And I think if we had had a couple more days or weeks, I do believe Kamala Harris and Joe Biden could have got that message out a little bit more saliently. And then of course, Vice President, Governor Wallace did a great job too. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=414.0s)]
*  And just to Haima's point, I mean, there's a couple of things, right? We talked about immigration. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=426.12s)]
*  Dude, everyone is so bad at their jobs. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=430.6s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=433.36s)]
*  We saw Governor Abbott. He was arguably the unsung hero of this political campaign, right, by bringing immigration to the fore. When you look at Donald Trump's, what he's arguing is a mandate for a second term based off of the margin of victory that he had over Vice President Harris. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=434.0s)]
*  I mean, you look at some of those blue states, that's what's emboldening him. And that's also the warning sign, I can think, for the Democrats, right? Because it is immigration. It is inflation. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=450.16s)]
*  She was quite defensive, as was Biden when Haima mentioned some of the indicators, right? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=460.72s)]
*  President Biden, before Harris, assumed the mantle, which has come out and talked about all of these statistics from the Economic Council, excuse me, etc. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=465.92s)]
*  And Americans aren't feeling that when they go to the grocery store and pay for eggs and bread and all of those other things. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=475.96000000000004s)]
*  And Vice President Harris, I think the campaign fell a little bit short of understanding and being able to articulate Americans' pain. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=482.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, so let's dig in a little bit more on Stephen in particular there. Of course, we've spent a lot of time on and it was an ad that was framed around trans issues, right? That the Trump campaign put a lot of money behind and it was, you know, Kamala Harris is for they them, Trump is for you. Here was how... [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=490.40000000000003s)]
*  They love that ad. I swear to Christ, the media, especially the liberal side of media likes that ad more than anyone else. They love pointing to that ad to be like, it was brilliant. It was amazing. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=508.76s)]
*  And I think it's because it just goes back to the same thing that I always talk about, which is that everyone is like a little transphobic to a lot transphobic. And so for that reason, especially when paired with the fearful nature of liberals, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=521.52s)]
*  they like, it creates a sense of panic where they're like, no, no, that was so good. It was so good. They got us. They got us. We're so we're so pro trans. They got us. No, when you're when you're not someone who is well defined, then people can make a mockery out of you when you have no genuinely held convictions and no universal programs that you're advocating for. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=535.64s)]
*  People can just like so easily turn around and be like, yeah, you only care about giving trans prisoners bottom surgery. It's so stupid. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=553.76s)]
*  Quentin Foulkes, who was on the campaign as well as David Plouffe, explained that in this postmortem. Let's watch. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=573.92s)]
*  Obviously, it was a very effective ad at the end. I ultimately don't believe that it was about the issue of trans. I think that it made her seem out of touch. And it was sort of a pseudo economic and underneath it. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=579.4s)]
*  At the end of the day, we were spending a lot of time with voters in these battleground states, both quantitatively and quantitatively. And this trans ad was not driving. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=591.48s)]
*  So he says the ads not driving votes. But when you listen to what Quentin said there, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=599.56s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure that they were testing the trans issue in a straightforward way. But if the ads about way more than that, it doesn't necessarily line up. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=603.76s)]
*  Right. And it's amazing how after an election, it's like one or two things that, oh, we lost because of that. But go back to the Virginia governor's race in 2021. The issues in that race were inflation, trans kids in sports and immigration. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=612.84s)]
*  Dude, that's crazy. My man is pointing to a special elections in a governor's race. Like it is perhaps the worst example. You might as well be talking about an election in fucking Zimbabwe to try and derive any sort of any sort of data that you can extrapolate from this conversation as like prescient is so is so childish. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=629.84s)]
*  Brother, what happened after 2021? There was a midterm election. You went back to 2021 to a gubernatorial special race? Are you stupid? How are you a how are you a paid commentator? Red states have blue governors, blue states have red governors, people have a much closer relationship with their [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=657.2s)]
*  governors. Okay. It bears no basis on a broader political conversation in general. Mark Robinson, for many different reasons, lost the electoral, the gubernatorial race on the same ticket where Kamala Harris lost. Okay. Andy Bichard is a Democrat and one of the most popular governors in the nation state. And Andy Bichard is a pro trans Democrat in Kentucky. Yeah. Vermont reelected a Republican governor by landslide. This is just how it is. You can't just go to a Republican governor and say, Oh, I'm going to go to a Republican governor. I'm going to go to a Republican governor. I'm going to go to a Republican governor. I'm going to go to a Republican governor. I'm going to go to a Republican governor. I'm going to go to a Republican governor. I'm going to go to a Republican governor. I'm going to go to a Republican governor. I'm going to go to a Republican governor. I'm going to go to a Republican governor. I'm going to go to a Republican governor [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=679.2s)]
*  I'm going to go to a Republican governor. I'm going to go to a Republican governor. I'm going to go to a Republican governor. I'm just saying, It's UN something 구독 this is OMG, this could happen. You can't extrapolate. You can't. You can't use governor races as a serious metric for anything, especially a special election. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=709.2s)]
*  That is just a gubernatorial race, Oh my god, you're so stupid. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=725.0s)]
*  That completely prefigured this election. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=729.48s)]
*  I think better than everyone thought they would [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=733.72s)]
*  in the midterm elections. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=735.8000000000001s)]
*  That people kind of forgot that, but I think the election. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=737.76s)]
*  And that's why we ended up with a 170 day campaign, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=740.96s)]
*  by the way. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=743.08s)]
*  But I think the election was probably lost three years ago [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=743.9200000000001s)]
*  when the White House was saying inflation was transitory [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=746.04s)]
*  when everyone knew it wasn't. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=748.2s)]
*  And they were saying there wasn't a border crisis [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=749.72s)]
*  when there was. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=751.96s)]
*  Do you agree? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=753.24s)]
*  Oh yeah, I agree. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=754.52s)]
*  I also think there were parental issues [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=755.36s)]
*  in that gubernatorial race in 2021. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=757.96s)]
*  I mean, it was a, let me put it to you [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=759.88s)]
*  that there's so many places I could go with this. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=762.24s)]
*  But let me just put it in this context. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=763.96s)]
*  When you had, the they them was the important line [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=766.68s)]
*  in that ad. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=769.28s)]
*  It had less to do with the transgender issue [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=770.36s)]
*  and more with the they them, the wokeness. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=773.4s)]
*  When you juxtapose Vice President Harris and Beyonce [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=775.4399999999999s)]
*  against Donald Trump at either McDonald's [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=780.24s)]
*  or wearing an orange vest in a garbage truck. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=782.6s)]
*  That- [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=785.24s)]
*  Donald who's a billionaire, brother? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=786.08s)]
*  What the fuck are you talking about? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=788.2800000000001s)]
*  So like, I know for a fact that he would be ripping [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=789.32s)]
*  into Kamala Harris if she also did the same dumb ass thing [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=792.44s)]
*  that Donald Trump did by, you know, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=797.2800000000001s)]
*  cosplaying as a regular layman. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=800.0400000000001s)]
*  Everyone would rip into her. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=803.0s)]
*  It's so dumb. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=804.72s)]
*  That is, that was the difference in the election. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=806.1600000000001s)]
*  And it had everything to do with the economy, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=808.48s)]
*  but it also had to do with who is speaking directly [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=810.36s)]
*  to the voters. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=813.7600000000001s)]
*  And you had Donald Trump doing what Democrats [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=814.8800000000001s)]
*  have done for decades, speaking directly [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=818.12s)]
*  to working class voters. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=819.64s)]
*  And the Harris campaign either ignored them, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=821.12s)]
*  didn't think they needed them. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=824.24s)]
*  I don't know what their idea was there, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=825.48s)]
*  but they made a vibe election bet. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=827.76s)]
*  He made a base election, unvoted, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=831.52s)]
*  you know, low propensity voter bet and he won. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=834.56s)]
*  For sure. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=837.48s)]

*  you know, give a post-mortem, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=847.44s)]
*  you think you would go to a traditional media outlet [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=848.72s)]
*  that way they can ask some, you know, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=851.4000000000001s)]
*  Common Campaign Blame's back question [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=853.32s)]

*  Okay. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=856.8800000000001s)]
*  Dude, it's crazy how hard the Republicans are just cooking. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=857.72s)]
*  They are absolutely fucking dominating [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=860.9200000000001s)]
*  the Democratic media, the Democratic party apparatus. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=864.72s)]
*  They've just been nonstop. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=868.5600000000001s)]
*  It's been an endless faucet of fucking onage. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=870.5600000000001s)]
*  God damn, it must feel good to be a Republican right around. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=873.44s)]
*  Now you're like that. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=875.6s)]
*  We want everything brother. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=876.44s)]
*  Where was I? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=881.84s)]
*  Oh, Adam and K the, this timidity, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=882.6800000000001s)]
*  lack of situational understanding and deference to power [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=885.1600000000001s)]
*  is the reason why people like this are hired in advance [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=887.36s)]
*  in the eco DNC ecosystem, legacy news corporations, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=890.4000000000001s)]
*  et cetera, select schools, communities, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=893.1600000000001s)]
*  and mentors cultivate this nibble around the edges approach. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=895.9200000000001s)]
*  And in the face of an act of genocide, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=900.32s)]
*  climate collapse and widespread economic predation [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=901.68s)]
*  slash corruption is absolutely killing us. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=903.76s)]
*  Also, I just found out that Adam and K [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=905.8399999999999s)]
*  actually follows me on Twitter. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=907.8399999999999s)]
*  Watch this space. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=910.04s)]

*  I think I, it's so funny that I use his movies so much. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=913.16s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=918.52s)]
*  He saw your Schmeet yesterday, have some shame. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=919.3599999999999s)]
*  Maybe that's why he started to follow me. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=922.9599999999999s)]
*  He was like, man, I, he's like, look, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=924.2399999999999s)]
*  ultimately I don't really care about a man's Schmeet, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=927.24s)]
*  but like he has a respectable one, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=930.32s)]
*  which is worthy of a follow. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=932.2800000000001s)]
*  Like he's like, it doesn't tickle my fancy [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=933.6400000000001s)]
*  in like a gay way, but I respect it in like a, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=936.36s)]
*  like a manly way. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=938.88s)]
*  Tough questions. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=940.24s)]
*  Instead though, bomb a crew that ran Kamala Harris campaign [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=941.44s)]
*  went to the Obama bros, which were the speech writers, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=946.6s)]
*  the comms team, save America, save America. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=949.36s)]
*  And this is what they had to say. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=952.44s)]
*  Dude, pod save America is getting, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=954.0s)]

*  That's so funny. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=958.32s)]
*  The left hates them because they're like, oh, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=959.92s)]
*  you guys are establishment shields. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=963.52s)]
*  And the right obviously hate them also [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=965.7199999999999s)]
*  because they're like your democratic party establishment [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=968.0s)]
*  shields and the democratic party establishment hates them [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=969.88s)]
*  because they're like, oh, you're not loyal enough. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=973.64s)]
*  Even though they have been, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=977.36s)]
*  and they haven't really gotten enough in return [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=978.5999999999999s)]
*  for that loyalty either. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=980.4399999999999s)]
*  That's what's hilarious about it. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=982.8399999999999s)]
*  Is that like, it's not like the fucking fuck. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=984.04s)]
*  You mean them, you're a pod John. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=987.5999999999999s)]
*  Okay, that's true. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=988.8s)]
*  I'm a pod John. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=990.48s)]
*  I'm a pod John now. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=991.3199999999999s)]
*  Okay, so put some respect on it. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=993.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=995.28s)]
*  The CNN video is out now. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=996.12s)]
*  The CNN video is out and Kaia is on it. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=999.1999999999999s)]
*  That's right, Kaia is on the main stage. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1001.36s)]
*  Oh, by the way, you know who was really mad at them? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1003.88s)]
*  The fucking Kennedy guy, Jack Schlossberg, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1006.52s)]
*  who he's like somewhat unwell, I think. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1009.72s)]
*  And he's always like popping off on TikTok. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1012.8s)]
*  He sometimes shows up on my For You page too. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1014.64s)]
*  But he said podcast was a comedy, not a tragedy. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1016.8s)]
*  Absolutely no grace or humility, no accountability, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1020.64s)]
*  no clue, truly insulting. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1022.5999999999999s)]
*  But there's a happy ending. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1024.36s)]
*  Never have to listen to the person below again, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1025.36s)]
*  and neither do any of you. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1027.3999999999999s)]
*  Crank T Nelson says, Jack, I'm afraid you are very mistaken [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1029.04s)]
*  about the nature of the Democratic party [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1031.52s)]
*  if you think we won't hear from election losers again. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1032.68s)]
*  Yeah, the IRS just said it wants 20 billion more money. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1035.44s)]
*  Do you think this budget should be increased, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1038.28s)]
*  same decrease, deleted? [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1040.52s)]
*  What? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1042.1599999999999s)]
*  Flat tax for all, no loopholes. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1043.0s)]
*  I suspect when they say flat tax, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1044.72s)]
*  they don't mean like, you know, a flat percentage. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1047.36s)]
*  They mean like a finite amount. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1050.8s)]
*  They mean like, you know, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1053.08s)]
*  everybody pays like a thousand dollars, I don't know. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1054.8799999999999s)]
*  We are so cooked. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1057.76s)]
*  America as an Asian is so cooked. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1059.08s)]
*  I will always keep repeating this. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1061.4s)]
*  Pramila Harris was refused by Sean Evans, by the way, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1063.8s)]
*  which I thought was pretty funny. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1067.84s)]
*  We would do an interview, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1070.28s)]
*  and the questions were small and processy [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1071.44s)]
*  and about like- [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1075.84s)]
*  Dumb, just dumb. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1077.3999999999999s)]
*  They were not informing a voter [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1078.8799999999999s)]
*  who was trying to listen to learn more or to understand. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1080.8799999999999s)]
*  That does a disservice to voters, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1084.56s)]
*  and being up against a narrative [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1086.36s)]
*  that we weren't doing anything, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1089.0s)]
*  or we were afraid to have interviews is complete ****, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1090.24s)]
*  and also like took hold a little bit, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1094.28s)]
*  and we just gave us another thing we had to fight back for [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1095.8799999999999s)]
*  that Trump never had to worry about. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1098.76s)]
*  Well, I mean, look, everyone could look back. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1101.24s)]
*  This is the time to be honest. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1104.04s)]
*  You have nothing to lose. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1106.3200000000002s)]
*  You're getting into that mode of midterms. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1107.16s)]
*  But when she says she blames the people [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1109.3200000000002s)]
*  for asking small questions, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1110.96s)]
*  that is the funniest thing I've ever heard in my life. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1112.68s)]
*  I blame the friendly questions [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1115.16s)]
*  that we got from friendly journals. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1117.0400000000002s)]
*  Layups. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1118.72s)]
*  Where 77% of all the, your coverage was positive. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1119.5600000000002s)]
*  Where something like 85% of all Trump's was negative, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1123.96s)]
*  and you blame the questions. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1127.16s)]
*  Dude, you wanna know something crazy? [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1128.92s)]

*  What the ****? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1154.1200000000001s)]

*  like adversarial questions. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1157.76s)]

*  The media was like, all right, you're playing ball. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1171.52s)]
*  We got you. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1173.08s)]

*  being at the DNC to begin with. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1242.76s)]

*  It was Jamie Harrison side that was very agitated about it. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1247.04s)]
*  And as far as I understand from the people that I talked to [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1252.28s)]

*  the Joe Rogan podcast. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1309.04s)]

*  What went into those decisions? [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1325.96s)]
*  What was it like growing up in San Francisco [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1327.48s)]
*  with a single parent? [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1330.28s)]
*  So that's when you have an opportunity [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1331.4s)]
*  over the course of three hours to show your personality. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1332.76s)]
*  Trump did it, but the format worked for Trump. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1335.8400000000001s)]
*  Andrew Schultz and these guys, they were funny. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1338.44s)]
*  That's when he's his best. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1340.96s)]
*  He's self-effacing. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1341.8000000000002s)]
*  So if you are self-effacing and you have a degree of humility, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1343.16s)]
*  that's why you love the format. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1346.5600000000002s)]
*  No, Donald Trump is not self-effacing at all. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1348.2800000000002s)]
*  He is funny. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1352.48s)]
*  He's telegenic. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1353.64s)]

*  What are you talking about, dude? [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1356.48s)]
*  I feel like these guys genuinely, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1358.2800000000002s)]
*  saying Trump experiences or exhibits humility [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1359.96s)]
*  is so mind-boggling to me. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1363.52s)]
*  We are living on an alternative plane of existence, dude. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1365.2s)]
*  You are not living on planet Earth, I'm sorry. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1368.44s)]
*  You are fucking out of your mind. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1371.72s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1373.96s)]
*  He's never demonstrated humility at all. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1374.96s)]
*  The only difference is Trump is honestly dishonest, okay? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1377.8799999999999s)]
*  He comes across as earnest in his dishonesty. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1382.6s)]
*  He's like, yeah, I'm a scumbag, but I'm your scumbag. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1385.64s)]
*  That's it. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1388.36s)]
*  Whereas Democrats, even if they're being honest, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1389.4s)]
*  come across as fucking dishonest. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1392.52s)]
*  They're so scared. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1394.92s)]
*  They're meek. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1396.1200000000001s)]
*  They're insincere. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1397.3200000000002s)]
*  They come across as technocratic elitists. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1399.24s)]
*  And then you hop in with 60 Minutes. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1402.44s)]
*  You answer some questions circuitously, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1403.88s)]
*  and they make you seem smart. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1407.6000000000001s)]
*  They edit your answers, and you're still complaining? [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1409.6000000000001s)]
*  And you were scared to do an interview. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1412.72s)]
*  Don't lie about it. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1414.8400000000001s)]
*  You didn't put her in front of the cameras [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1416.0800000000002s)]
*  until after the DNC. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1418.56s)]
*  So true. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1420.44s)]
*  Emily, they blamed Trump actually when it came to that. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1421.28s)]
*  They said, look, they were actually [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1424.1599999999999s)]
*  trying to do the interview that same day [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1425.9199999999998s)]

*  couldn't make it work. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1431.04s)]
*  It's to Brian's point, though, they really [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1432.6s)]
*  didn't want to do the interview. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1434.44s)]
*  There were people within the campaign staff [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1435.8s)]
*  that didn't think that she was shine A. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1438.0s)]
*  And number two, as James Carville made it very clear, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1440.28s)]
*  the young people on the campaign, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1443.48s)]
*  the crazy blue hair, purple hair. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1445.56s)]
*  They said, don't do Rogan. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1448.9199999999998s)]
*  That's right. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1450.56s)]
*  The handshake coming from the fucking liberal mainstream [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1451.76s)]
*  media outlets and the stupid ass Fox News [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1454.72s)]
*  and the rest of the right wing circuit is so frustrating. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1458.84s)]
*  They're all in unison saying the same shit. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1464.1599999999999s)]
*  Every single one of your parents, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1467.6799999999998s)]
*  you're going to see them. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1469.2s)]
*  If you haven't seen them already, [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1470.24s)]
*  you're going to see them in the upcoming days. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1471.52s)]
*  They are going to repeat the exact same dumb ass talking [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1473.6399999999999s)]
*  points to you because both the Republican side [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1476.76s)]
*  and the liberal side, if you're over the age of 45, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1481.28s)]
*  you're over the age of 50, you're watching television. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1485.12s)]
*  And television man is saying the exact same shit. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1488.1999999999998s)]
*  I like that the liberals, instead of licking their wounds [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1490.9199999999998s)]
*  and doing an autopsy, have decided, you know what? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1493.12s)]
*  There's a far greater enemy out here, trans people, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1495.6s)]
*  undocumented immigrants, and the left. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1498.4399999999998s)]
*  OK, how are you any different than the Republican right then? [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1501.1999999999998s)]
*  For someone that effectively attempted to have us believe [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1505.72s)]
*  in her as a leader, and by the way, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1509.24s)]
*  she was the current vice president this entire time, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1510.6799999999998s)]
*  and yet remains unchallenged. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1513.1999999999998s)]
*  To your point about all of these interviews, everything she said [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1515.72s)]
*  was never challenged. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1518.28s)]
*  She never had a follow up question. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1520.08s)]
*  Contrast that with President Trump [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1522.24s)]
*  during a debate where everyone said it was three on one. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1523.6399999999999s)]
*  Everything he said was challenged, twisted, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1526.04s)]
*  manipulated, and pushed back. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1528.1999999999998s)]
*  She had every softball, every option, every opportunity, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1529.8s)]
*  every time, and yet she wants us to believe [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1533.0s)]
*  that she's the victim, that the scheduling didn't work out, [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1535.36s)]
*  that she can't make something work, [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1537.8799999999999s)]
*  and yet you want me to put my faith in you [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1539.08s)]
*  as a commander in chief? [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1540.68s)]
*  You think I can trust you with the nuclear codes, [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1542.12s)]
*  with diplomacy, with representing me [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1544.56s)]
*  on the national and global stage, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1546.8s)]
*  and you can't even articulate the answer [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1548.44s)]
*  to a softball question as to economic policy [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1551.2s)]
*  or why you flip-flopped? [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1553.96s)]
*  She should have never did the rally in Houston. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1554.8s)]
*  There was no shot in winning Texas. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1557.9199999999998s)]
*  There was absolutely no shot. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1560.32s)]
*  It would have been more beneficial to the campaign [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1561.48s)]
*  to do the interview than do that rally in Texas. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1565.3999999999999s)]
*  They had this, just like the poll that was released [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1568.56s)]
*  days before Iowa, there was no shot in winning Iowa. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1573.48s)]
*  Everyone knew it, it was an outlier. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1576.6799999999998s)]
*  Instead, they wanted the voters, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1579.28s)]
*  they said the same thing about Florida. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1580.8s)]
*  There's a shot, we're seeing some movement. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1582.32s)]
*  Rhonda Sanz has dominated in Florida [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1584.3999999999999s)]
*  for the last election cycle, okay? [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1587.44s)]
*  Midterms and his governor's race. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1589.92s)]
*  So there was no data to suggest. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1592.8400000000001s)]
*  What about who the Dems put in charge [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1595.76s)]
*  versus who the Republicans put in charge? [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1597.04s)]
*  Like Trump picks are insane, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1598.3600000000001s)]
*  no Dem president has ever had picks like that. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1599.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, no, Democrats put more competent pieces of shit [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1603.28s)]
*  in positions of power, whereas the Republicans [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1606.6000000000001s)]
*  put direct monsters in positions of power. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1608.8s)]
*  But I don't know why you're even bringing that up. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1611.96s)]
*  I mean, there's no argument here, yes. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1614.76s)]
*  Democrats will bring about a more moderate, [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1616.56s)]
*  a managed fascism as opposed to the Republican party [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1619.92s)]
*  that wants this volatility of full tilt fascism. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1622.96s)]
*  Democrats are there to always, [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1626.2s)]
*  is always there to either normalize Republican positions [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1628.76s)]
*  or restructure the government, [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1633.4s)]
*  maybe pick up some of the pieces [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1635.24s)]
*  that the Republicans destroyed, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1636.6s)]
*  but never fully actually clawing back [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1638.96s)]
*  all of the gross power transfers [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1641.6s)]
*  that the Republicans engaged in [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1644.28s)]
*  for the exchange of resources or deregulation [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1646.52s)]
*  that the Republican party put in place. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1649.8400000000001s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1652.2s)]
*  If you don't want the Republicans to put fucking assholes [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1656.88s)]
*  into positions of power, and I certainly don't want that, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1660.8400000000001s)]
*  then you have to run a good race. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1664.76s)]
*  You have to be a competent, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1667.16s)]
*  a competent politician even before the race. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1669.96s)]
*  This is what is frustrating about this process, okay? [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1674.2s)]
*  I don't want Donald Trump to win. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1678.28s)]
*  I didn't want Donald Trump to win. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1679.72s)]
*  I made that very clear. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1680.88s)]
*  But the reality is I was frustrated with the Democrats [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1682.8s)]
*  because they were going to lose to Donald Trump. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1684.96s)]
*  They were making a very dangerous gamble. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1688.0800000000002s)]
*  And it turns out I was right. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1690.72s)]
*  Even though towards the end, I was like, [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1691.88s)]
*  maybe there's opportunity here, slight opportunity, [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1693.44s)]
*  even though I favor Trump winning the popular vote. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1696.72s)]
*  You're a fucking loser, baby. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1702.0800000000002s)]
*  Trump 2024, baby, you're a fucking loser, man. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1704.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it already happened. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1706.88s)]
*  Trump is already going to be president. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1708.3600000000001s)]
*  And I'm willing to bet that your life is not going to change [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1710.92s)]

*  It's gonna get worse. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1716.8000000000002s)]
*  And we'll check back with you in a couple years. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1718.52s)]

*  And, wait, what? [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1725.1200000000001s)]
*  You have a good head on your shoulders, keep it up. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1729.24s)]

*  for the place they're building [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJOBOev88T8&t=1733.84s)]
