# Trump's New Policies Are Getting Worse | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A)
*  It's a weird predicament because on the one hand, I think the bully pulpit is something [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=0.0s)]
*  I've consistently mentioned is the bully pulpit is like the most important power that the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=5.04s)]
*  president has. Okay. And Donald Trump is utilizing it. He's using, he's utilizing it right. He's [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=9.88s)]
*  doing it right. These rallies are actually correct. It's the right thing to do. The issue [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=17.32s)]
*  on the other hand is that Donald Trump is, his agenda is awful. Trump's historic first [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=22.08s)]
*  week in the White House. He's already back to rallying. This man is in Las Vegas. I'll [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=34.8s)]
*  show you the jacket. Hold on. I blasted off already chatters. Let the people know we're [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=44.44s)]
*  live. We're alive. Day five of Burger Reich. Donald Trump's already doing a rally. We're [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=54.8s)]
*  so back boys. We're so back. He wants to win president to McDonald's. He's going to win [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=62.64s)]
*  something new. He's running for something entirely different that we're not even, we're [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=86.52s)]
*  not even aware of. Okay. He's going to be running for pussy too. Like, I don't know why he's [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=90.76s)]
*  rallying still. I have no idea. I don't understand. Thank you. Wherever you may be. Hi, single. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=95.28s)]
*  Thank you very much. Republican national commitment. Jim D. Graff and Reed. That's a hell of a [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=102.60000000000001s)]
*  beautiful name, but I know the name so long. It's easier to say one of the greatest people, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=110.68s)]
*  I'll tell you a man who's done so damn well. I don't know what it is with him. He's just a legend. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=115.6s)]
*  He's one person, you know, we can also to be replaced. We don't like to think that maybe it's [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=121.32s)]
*  not true, but this is a guy that can't be replaced. There's nobody like him. Dana White. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=126.64s)]
*  Where's Dana White? Where the hell is he? UFC. The Nugboys here. Oh, yeah. There they are. The [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=131.84s)]
*  Nugboys right there. And Rick Harrison. Rick, thank you very much for being here. You're around [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=146.36s)]
*  here someplace with Dana. Mr. Phil Ruffin, his wife, Alexandra, and their two beautiful children, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=154.28s)]
*  Richard and Marlena. Phil, where's Ruffin? Where's Phil Ruffin? He's right here. Say some legend. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=161.28s)]
*  I'll tell you. He's a legend in Las Vegas and beyond. Phil, he's here. He'll be coming out. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=170.84s)]
*  Today we talk about how we're going to end the economic suffering and stagnation and disaster [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=175.8s)]
*  of the past four years and create the four greatest years in the history of our country. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=183.24s)]
*  That's what's going to happen. And as I said in my inaugural address, which by the way, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=187.8s)]
*  it got the highest rating in the history. That's amazing. All right. Blast off. The golden age of [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=197.84s)]
*  America begins right now. But I have to be honest with you. I'm really here for a different reason. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=208.28s)]
*  I'm here to say thank you. I went to North Carolina yesterday and then I flew to see just [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=214.52s)]
*  an unbelievable problem and just a mess in Los Angeles. Right. And I said, you know what I [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=221.72000000000003s)]
*  ought to do? I want to come to a state known as Nevada. Has anyone ever heard of it? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=229.4s)]
*  And don't ever mispronounce the name. You're not allowed to do that. You mispronounce the name. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=237.56s)]
*  You got a problem. You ever see somebody when they say it's Nevada, Nevada? Dude, he knows. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=241.8s)]
*  They're in deep, they're in deep trouble. I want to come to Nevada. Never do. Never do. Never do. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=251.8s)]
*  That's how you do it. Never do. I know, I know how to do it. The only Republican win of this [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=258.2s)]
*  state in decades is never do. Very big landslide. So. But I think Republicans are going to win a lot [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=263.0s)]
*  now. But it was a it was a big we had a big win and it was a bad signal for the Democrats [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=271.48s)]
*  here that we were leading so big here and Joe helped us so much and a lot of people in this [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=277.88s)]
*  room helped us a lot. I had to check the audio on my end. And so I said, you know what I'll do? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=285.16s)]
*  We're going to fly around it. And I said, let's fly right over it. Let's land and I'll just say, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=290.76s)]
*  but I want to say it and I'm almost saying it right here for the media. I just came here because [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=296.36s)]
*  I wanted to thank the people of Nevada for giving us such a big. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=300.76s)]
*  A lot of great friends. I better not introduce them while I'll be here all day. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=325.24s)]
*  Under our leadership, we're going to defeat inflation, bring down prices. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=329.56s)]
*  We're going to raise those wages. They're going to go up. They're going to go up. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=333.96s)]
*  Put more money in your pocket, secure our borders, restore law and order to our cities. And [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=339.15999999999997s)]
*  we're going to make America great again. And for four long years, the last administration [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=344.84s)]
*  waged war on the American middle class and everybody else. They had a lot of wars. We [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=353.4s)]
*  had no wars when I left. You know, they had, we defeated ISIS and we stayed out. Nobody wanted [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=357.4s)]
*  to mess with us. They had a lot of wars. We're still, we're trying to put them out. We'll get [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=363.0s)]
*  them put out. Don't worry. We'll get them put out. We were, we were headed to world war three. I'm [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=367.79999999999995s)]
*  telling you, we would have had problems like you wouldn't believe. They shut down American energy, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=372.67999999999995s)]
*  buried you in crippling regulation, imposed hidden taxes and spent trillions and trillions of dollars [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=377.47999999999996s)]
*  on waste corruption and radical left lunacy. These were lunatics. The result was the most brutal [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=384.12s)]
*  inflation in a half a century, perhaps ever in this country. I think ever and soaring prices for [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=390.76s)]
*  food, groceries and other household goods. The people of Nevada are now paying nearly $1,200 [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=397.8s)]
*  per month more to make ends meet. The price of eggs is so down. Think of that. $1,200 at least, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=405.16s)]
*  but since I became the 47th president at noon on Monday, I've been moving with urgency and [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=413.56s)]
*  historic spirit to fix every single calamity of the Biden administration that they've created. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=419.24s)]
*  And this week alone, I took nearly 350 executive actions to reverse [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=427.08000000000004s)]
*  the horrible failures and betrayals that we inherited from a group of people that [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=434.92s)]
*  didn't know what the hell they were doing, what they've done to this country, especially the open [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=439.16s)]
*  borders where they have, think of it, 21 million people came in. Many of them are criminals, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=444.6s)]
*  murderers. Well, we're getting them out. You see it. You see it yesterday. First day. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=450.76000000000005s)]
*  Our message could not be more clear. America's decline is over. American decline is over. We're [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=457.24s)]
*  left at all over the world. Now we're not left at any more. I'll tell you what the world witnessed [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=463.0s)]
*  this week is nothing less than a revolution of wealth creation for everyone and also common sense. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=468.36s)]
*  It's about common sense. It really is with a party of common sense. On day one, I directed every member [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=474.28000000000003s)]
*  of my cabinet to and by the way, Pete Hagseth got approved. And Christine Ohm just got approved. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=481.16s)]
*  Governor, she's going to keep her. She's a tough one. She's a tough one. And she's going to do a [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=492.76s)]
*  great job. And day one, I directed every member of my cabinet to marshal all powers at their [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=500.68s)]
*  disposal to defeat inflation and bring down the cost of daily life. We want to bring prices down [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=506.2s)]
*  too high. They went way up. They didn't come down. I imposed a federal hiring freeze, a federal [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=511.8s)]
*  regulation freeze, a foreign aid freeze. Oh, that's a nice one. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=517.96s)]
*  And I created the new department of government efficiency. And we're going to have a lot of [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=523.48s)]
*  good people. Elon, we're going to get Elon Musk to get involved in that a little bit. He already is. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=528.36s)]
*  People like him. I terminated the ridiculous and incredibly wasteful Green New Scam. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=535.0s)]
*  Wasn't the environment supposed to eat us up like in 12 years, but that was [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=540.04s)]
*  like 13 years ago. What happened? We're still here. We're still here. Remember we have 12 years to [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=550.36s)]
*  live. Remember that? Done by somebody that never even took a course on the environment. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=556.36s)]
*  AOC plus three. Do you remember those two? They were telling us about the environment. AOC plus [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=562.52s)]
*  three. This action alone will save hundreds of billions of dollars of American taxpayers money. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=568.52s)]
*  I withdrew from the one sided Paris climate accord. And I canceled the insane and costly electric [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=575.4s)]
*  vehicle mandate. Keeping my sacred pledge to America's autoworkers. Boy, did we get a big [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=584.52s)]
*  vote with the autoworkers. Yeah, now the video is too loud. Any deepsters in the room? We got a [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=592.92s)]
*  tremendous vote for the teamsters. Thank you. They're pointing like one, one guy. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=597.72s)]
*  But they voted for us in the millions. We have, we had a lot of teamsters voting for us. I withdrew [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=605.0s)]
*  from the world health organization where we paid $500 million a year and China paid 30. This is how [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=610.84s)]
*  you know who's fake as hell about the teamsters. Are there a lot of teams in the room? They support [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=622.84s)]
*  me, but like he doesn't give any, he doesn't talk about the ongoing potential Costco strike. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=627.08s)]
*  He could even talk about Costco being woke if he wanted to, but of course he's not pro labor, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=633.0s)]
*  even when it comes to like an aesthetic victory. He's like, I love the teamsters. Are you in the [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=638.44s)]
*  room? Teamsters go ahead. Talk about the Costco strike. Potentially it's about to happen. It's [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=643.64s)]
*  imminent or years ago, but Biden immediately went back to the labor, the labor unions. And you know, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=647.32s)]
*  they offered me a 39 million. They said, we'll let you back in at 39. So we're going to reduce it [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=654.68s)]
*  from 500 to 39. I turned them down because it became so popular. I didn't know if it would be [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=659.0799999999999s)]
*  well received even at 39, but maybe we would consider doing it again. I don't know. Maybe we [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=665.3199999999999s)]
*  would have to clean it up a little bit, but China pays 39 million for 1.4 billion and we're paying [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=670.68s)]
*  500 million for 325 million. I don't know what the hell is wrong with these people. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=676.8399999999999s)]
*  And then when Biden went back in, you know, they immediately went back in. They paid more [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=685.24s)]
*  than we were paying in the first place. They paid more than the 500 million. So they knew they could [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=690.6s)]
*  have had it for 39. They paid more. You wouldn't do that, Joe, right? Now think of it. They know [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=695.56s)]
*  they have a deal at 39. So they went back in at 525 million. What the hell? Man, oh man, it just, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=701.24s)]
*  it infuriates you, doesn't it? I declared a national energy emergency to unlock the liquid [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=710.68s)]
*  gold under our feet and pave the way for rapid approvals of the new energy infrastructure. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=717.7199999999999s)]
*  The United States has the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on earth, and we may be a [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=724.92s)]
*  very substantially enlarged country in the not too distant. Isn't it nice to see, you know, for [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=729.88s)]
*  years, for decades, where the same size to the square foot probably got smaller, actually, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=737.4s)]
*  but we might be in a large country pretty soon. And one of the things we're going to be doing is [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=744.36s)]
*  drill, baby drill, because that's going to bring everything down. It's going to bring everything [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=751.3199999999999s)]

*  there's no call. They'd say he didn't call. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1016.6s)]
*  The stories are, I mean, these stories are not very exaggerated. I want to tell you a little bit, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1024.12s)]
*  a little bit for laughter, but you know, it's only for laughter. The fake news will say, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1030.28s)]

*  him on the phone. And the problem I have is that when I speak to the, and I speak to him immediately, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1043.24s)]
*  they'll say, could we speak to the president? Would that be possible? We could do it anytime [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1048.44s)]
*  over the next month. They're so used to this, right? I say, no, I'm picking it up right now. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1052.84s)]

*  I cannot get them off the phone. I can't get people. If you can't, I say, I have to go now, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1072.1200000000001s)]

*  You know, for years, they haven't spoken. They didn't even know we had a president, if you want [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1081.8s)]
*  to know. But under our leadership, America is back open for business. And it's really open. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1087.0s)]
*  And they have, though, they said, you know, there's like a light all over the world now. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1098.36s)]

*  but there's a light all over the world. We've accomplished more in one week than other [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1105.4s)]
*  administrations have accomplished in four years. And we're just getting started. We got rid of the [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1110.2s)]
*  woke. We got rid of the woke crap. What a lot of stuff. It's a weird predicament because on the [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1115.4s)]
*  one hand, I think the bully pulpit is something I've consistently mentioned is the bully pulpit [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1122.76s)]
*  is like the most important power that the president has. Okay. And Donald Trump is utilizing it. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1127.72s)]
*  He's using, he's utilizing it right. He's doing it right. These rallies are actually correct. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1135.64s)]
*  It's the right thing to do. The issue on the other hand is that Donald Trump is his agenda is [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1141.0s)]
*  awful. So he's basically using it to, to propagandize like nonsense. Right. So without, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1147.64s)]
*  like when I make this, when I make this, it's not a, when I'm making this statement, it's not about [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1157.32s)]
*  like, whether he is a good person or a good president or not. I'm simply talking about like [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1161.48s)]
*  the bully pulpit is a tool. Okay. I think it's a fantastic tool to cut away from the noise [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1169.0s)]
*  and, and basically describe what you're about, what you're going to do [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1181.64s)]
*  and what, you know, what accomplishments you've had so far. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1187.72s)]
*  Like, I think this is, he's a great politician, a terrible person. Yeah. He's a great politician [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1191.72s)]
*  for awful politics. Like bully pulpit is like this, what he's doing, the president speaking. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1201.96s)]
*  That's what it is. When the president speaks, he speaks from a position of authority. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1212.76s)]
*  Okay. And he doesn't have, he doesn't relegate himself to simply like press briefings and things [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1219.4s)]
*  of that nature where the media can like chop up things that you're saying. He's just like very [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1227.24s)]
*  clearly, he very clearly is communicating. He'll turn arc. No, you're misunderstanding what I'm [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1231.8799999999999s)]
*  saying. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. You're missing your misunderstanding. Donald Trump's politics are [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1237.24s)]
*  awful. He is the anti-Christ. Okay. The problem is the anti-Christ also happens to be very good. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1243.32s)]
*  Like the anti-Christ has to be very good at communicating his anti-Christ agenda. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1253.56s)]
*  We will have a quarter. Think of it. A quarter of the typical restaurant workers pay comes from [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1259.32s)]
*  tips. I didn't know that much. That's a lot. You haven't been reporting them for the last [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1264.9199999999998s)]
*  10 years. That's the issue. So here's our deal. We're going to have no tax on tips from now on, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1269.72s)]
*  but we're going to go after you viciously for all the money you didn't report for the last 10, 15. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1276.04s)]
*  We're going to go after you for all the money you didn't report for. I'm only kidding. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1282.76s)]
*  I'm only kidding. I have to say to the fake news because they're going to say Trump is after all, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1286.84s)]
*  Trump is after all restaurant workers. Many of these workers are some of the very citizens who [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1292.28s)]
*  were hit hard and very hard by the ravages of the Biden economy, which was inflation. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1298.6s)]
*  When I think of Biden, I think of incompetence and inflation. Not being nice by saying. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1304.6799999999998s)]
*  I'm being nice when I say that. Yet even in the midst of the suffering he created, Joe Biden [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1313.1599999999999s)]
*  launched a cruel campaign to extract more money from tip workers. And that's what happened. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1319.1599999999999s)]
*  I'm telling you a young waitress, I won't say beautiful because you're not allowed to say that [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1324.28s)]
*  as a politician. Used to be you could say a young, beautiful waitress. This was a young, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1330.28s)]
*  beautiful waitress, but I won't say that because I feel like I want to continue my political career. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1334.68s)]
*  If you call, the governor won't say it. If you call a woman beautiful today, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1342.04s)]
*  it's the end of your political career. So I won't do it. But a young waitress, I think you [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1346.36s)]
*  could call young. You're probably not even supposed to say young. Probably supposed to say a waitress. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1352.28s)]
*  But a young waitress came up and I said, how are you doing? And in my restaurant in the hotel, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1359.08s)]
*  and Trump, I said, how are you doing? And she said, not great because they're after me so [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1363.72s)]
*  viciously for tips. They just want my tip income and they don't believe me and all of this. And [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1369.32s)]
*  she said, it's terrible. You know, sir, you should have no tax on tips. I said, what? [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1375.08s)]
*  Yes. So what did you just say? No tax on tips. That was about the amount of my consultation. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1381.8s)]
*  It's true. No tax. I said, what did you just say? Say those words again. Sir, no tax on tips. I said, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1391.32s)]
*  thank you very much. You just won the election. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1398.12s)]
*  I think it's going to be great. But under the Trump administration, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1400.12s)]
*  he's so fucking good. He's so I'm sorry. That is insane. Someone literally just took their bra off. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1412.6s)]
*  Someone's panties exploded in the crowd when he said that. That is a he's such a on a pure [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1420.52s)]
*  entertainer. Like when you, when you judge him just as a pure entertainer, like that is an insane, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1427.72s)]
*  he's so fucking good. After you and we're in the process of there's a Deborah in there that [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1433.48s)]

*  You know, they're so strong on guns, but these people are allowed to carry guns. So we'll [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1451.96s)]
*  probably move them to the border. Yeah. She said no tax on it. How about just no tax? [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1457.32s)]
*  No, I didn't miss the young, beautiful lady segment. I was, you know, in the background, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1468.92s)]
*  I heard you'll get canceled. If you say young, beautiful ladies, you get canceled. That's why [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1473.96s)]
*  I'm saying it. But years ago, 1870 to 1913, we didn't have an income tax. We had what we had [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1479.16s)]
*  as tariffs where foreign countries came in and they stole our jobs. They stole our companies. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1486.0400000000002s)]
*  They stole our product. They ripped us off. And, you know, they used to do numbers. And then we, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1491.0s)]
*  we went to tariff, a tariff system, and the tariff system made so much money. It was when we were the [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1496.44s)]
*  richest from 1870 to 1913. Then we came in with the brilliantly came in with an income tax. No, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1501.88s)]
*  we don't want others to pay. Let's have our people pay. And then you had the depression in 1928, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1508.68s)]
*  1929. I call it 1929. That was a bad time. But, you know, you didn't have tariffs and you had [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1514.52s)]
*  tariffs that ended in 1913. But it's, it was the richest our country ever was. I was President [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1520.3600000000001s)]
*  McKinley. In fact, we're renaming the mountain, Mountain McKinley in Alaska. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1530.36s)]
*  You know what else we're renaming? We're renaming the Gulf of Mexico into the Gulf of America. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1541.24s)]
*  And Mexico, actually, they were thrilled when they heard this. They said, that's nice. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1556.12s)]
*  A few months from now, when I sign our tax cut into law, we're going to deliver for the tip [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1560.28s)]
*  earning men and women who make it all work. I mean, it's going to be something very special, [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1566.12s)]
*  I think, for you. It's going to be a big, a big difference. And with us today is Jessica Angiano, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1571.8s)]
*  an employee here at Circus. This is a nice place, by the way. And I just make your owner. He's a [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1578.6s)]
*  nice man. He's rich too. But circus very nice and a hard working single mother of two with [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1582.52s)]
*  incredible children. Jessica's struggling to pay for medical bills. Also chat. Y'all are [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1592.04s)]
*  behind the skilled publishing policies about manipulating the masses. He's clearly very good [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1596.44s)]
*  at it. He's so good. He's convinced people he's right. Acknowledging that about him doesn't mean [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1601.48s)]
*  you agree with him. Yeah. I understand why chat doesn't see it because they despise him. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1604.84s)]
*  And it makes sense. So he doesn't hit your frequency. You know, he's a liar. When you [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1611.24s)]
*  know he's a liar, you're like, he's a gross, he's a gross lying racist piece of shit. I just don't [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1617.72s)]
*  see it. Okay. But for, for a lot of people in this country, a lot of people in this country, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1625.8s)]
*  he's not that guy for this reason. He's very charismatic regardless. He's just very telegenic [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1636.0400000000002s)]
*  regardless. You know what I mean? When people say, Oh man, like Trump is content. Like that's what [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1642.6000000000001s)]
*  they mean. They mean that he is like a telegenic person who knows how to keep the attention on him. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1649.48s)]
*  Okay. That's it. You can't say he's not telegenic or charismatic or a successful politician when [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1655.48s)]
*  he's defeated the Democrats twice at this point. Now that's mostly due to democratic parties in [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1664.2s)]
*  aptitude, but the reality of the matter is this is where he thrives. Like I think ultimately, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1669.32s)]
*  I guess the point I would make is this. Imagine Bernie Sanders winning the presidency. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1678.52s)]
*  Close your eyes for a brief moment and entertain the possibility of an alternative reality where [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1685.16s)]
*  Bernie Sanders has won the president and he's consistently utilizing the bully pulpit in a [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1690.6s)]
*  similar way to effectively communicate his agenda about Medicare for all, about how he's going after [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1696.9199999999998s)]
*  his enemies for Trump. The enemies are gay people, black people, women woke, DEI nonsense, right? [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1703.9599999999998s)]
*  But for Bernie Sanders, the enemies are the corporate oligarchs, the billionaires, the [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1712.6s)]
*  millionaires, right? The for-profit healthcare industry. If Bernie Sanders was also, I'm driving. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1716.44s)]
*  Okay. Well, don't type in the chat if you're driving and don't close your eyes if you're driving. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1726.2s)]
*  But that is what I mean. Like a competent politician who genuinely has an ideological [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1729.96s)]
*  perspective and an interest in, in uplifting the American working class could utilize this, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1737.64s)]
*  these same tools. This is what I'm saying. AMLO did a, did a very similar thing with Morena [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1745.32s)]
*  in Mexico. FDR used to have the fireside chats and AMLO did something quite similar, [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1751.96s)]
*  especially in a country like Mexico. The media is almost entirely controlled and dominated by [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1760.04s)]
*  private corporations owned by billionaires that are, are, you know, in charge of holding groups. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1767.6399999999999s)]
*  They have like, they have controlling invested interests in numerous sectors, right? So of course [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1775.16s)]
*  the media's, the media's coverage about AMLO was always going to be very, very negative. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1781.96s)]
*  Some countries go against that by, you know, doing state media propaganda, but in countries like [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1791.88s)]
*  Mexico and even countries like Venezuela, as a matter of fact, the, the overall private enterprise [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1799.08s)]
*  controls the entirety of the private media landscape. And it's very difficult to overcome. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1805.48s)]
*  So the only way to overcome that is by cutting through the noise and going directly to the [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1810.4399999999998s)]
*  population. Okay. That's it. And AMLO did that very successfully with us, with his daily briefings [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1815.08s)]
*  that he did online in Mexico. And I think that that is a perfect example of, of exactly what Trump [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1825.56s)]
*  is doing here, working, but from the perspective of, of leftist politics or social democratic [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1832.28s)]
*  policies. Right. And I think this is important to recognize. And it's hopefully something that maybe [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1839.32s)]
*  if we have a better future, it's, it's hopefully utilized by a competent politician [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1848.36s)]
*  with a pro labor agenda, with an agenda that actually helps the interest of the American [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1855.8799999999999s)]
*  population. So that's simply what I'm talking about. When I say Trump is a good politician [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1862.68s)]
*  with horrible politics, horrible policy. We're allowed to do it, but quite honestly, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1870.2s)]
*  we're restoring our country within hours of taking the oath of office. I declared a [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1876.2s)]
*  national emergency at our southern border. I sent active duty troops to the border to help repel [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1883.0s)]
*  the invasion. Tom Holman is leading the charge. You know that we like Tom Holman. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1889.88s)]
*  In 2021, Q1 AMLO literally knocked me off the top 10. I fell off. He fell on the violator back to [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1895.96s)]
*  the places from which they came. I signed an order that will [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1904.12s)]
*  designate the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1913.08s)]
*  It's a big deal. The sun is rising in the land of the rising sun. I didn't want to do that. No, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1918.52s)]
*  I don't want to do that. Biden didn't know he was alive. He didn't want to do it. He didn't want to [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1923.32s)]
*  do that. I always wanted to do it. You know, and we began to leverage the full and immense power [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1929.56s)]
*  of federal government and state government and enforcement to eliminate the presence of all [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1939.6399999999999s)]
*  foreign gangs and criminal networks, bringing devastating crime to American soil. And we don't [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1944.9199999999998s)]
*  allow people to enter our country and to dump their prisons into the United States of America [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1950.2s)]
*  anymore. When we see that our people are instructed to do whatever they have to do. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1955.64s)]
*  They can do whatever the hell they want to do throughout this week. The heroes of ice have [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1960.76s)]
*  been hunting down and arresting hundreds of illegal alien provenance [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1965.48s)]
*  and its immediate expulsion, including those with charges of convictions for rape, child sexual [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1976.3600000000001s)]
*  assault, terrorism and even murder members of the savage Venezuelan prison gang known as Trendy [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1982.04s)]
*  Aragua. You know that gang? This is not a nice group of people. They formed a prison and then [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1988.6s)]
*  they dumped their prisons into our country. So we had them. We had them all over the place. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1995.32s)]
*  Ask Colorado, the governor of Colorado. He doesn't know what to do about it. They're all over the [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=1999.24s)]
*  place. We'll get them out. We'll get them out. They're in a sense, they're in the real estate [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=2004.04s)]
*  business. They go into a building and they take it. You know, see when you buy a building, you have [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=2012.84s)]
*  to go out and get a mortgage or use your own cash. They just go into a building and take it. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=2017.3999999999999s)]
*  And they actually said, well, it's not that bad. They haven't taken that many buildings. Can you [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=2022.04s)]
*  imagine that? They haven't taken that many buildings. Oh, they're not that bad. But they're as [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=2026.6s)]
*  bad as the bloodthirsty MS-13 gangs that we have gotten thousands and thousands of them out. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=2031.72s)]
*  In fact, over 11,000 murderers were released into our country by other countries all over the world [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=2038.1200000000001s)]
*  because of Biden's open border policy. When I heard about that, I said they're just going to, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=2043.64s)]
*  everybody's going to empty out their prisons into our country. I said that I do that if I were [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=2048.84s)]
*  heading up any one of the many countries that you know about, not just South America all over, [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=2053.88s)]
*  they take their prisons and mental institutions and they empty them out into our country. Can [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=2058.68s)]
*  you imagine a person doing this? Can you imagine somebody doing that to our country? [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=2063.32s)]
*  For American citizens, January 20th, 2025 was truly liberation day. That was really liberation day. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=2069.72s)]
*  This week, I also signed an order to end the weaponization of our government against [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=2083.08s)]
*  American people and political people like me. We never had a thing like that. He went after his [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=2087.32s)]
*  political opponent. Who would have thought he helped me? I think he helped me get elected, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=2094.76s)]
*  Joe. You want to know the truth? I became much more popular. I'm the only guy that ever became [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=2099.32s)]
*  more popular when something like that happened. But these guys were just so inept. We had the guy [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=2104.28s)]
*  deranged Jack Smith, deranged. He was a deranged German man. But they thought this way Biden could [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=2110.92s)]
*  sneak by and he could win an election, another cheating in another election. That's what it was. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=2117.96s)]
*  But we won. You think that was fun? You think that was easy? It wasn't fun. And investigate all of [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=2123.2400000000002s)]
*  the abuses of power. I pardoned hundreds of political prisoners who had been viciously persecuted [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=2130.52s)]
*  by the Biden regime. Hundreds of people were persecuted, including Christians, pro-life [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=2136.84s)]
*  activists, two Washington DC police officers yesterday whose lives were destroyed from chasing [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=2144.52s)]
*  down a dangerous illegal alien criminal. And of course, I was very proud to pardon the J6 hostages. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=2150.68s)]
*  Once and for all, I stopped government censorship and we brought back free speech in America. We [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=2158.92s)]
*  brought it back. We did more of this last week. People can't even believe it. I also signed an [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=2170.36s)]
*  order to declassify and publish all remaining files related to the assassinations of President [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=2175.56s)]

*  all across the government and the private sector. We abolished 60 years of prejudice and hatred [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7-6NsiC1A&t=2193.7200000000003s)]
