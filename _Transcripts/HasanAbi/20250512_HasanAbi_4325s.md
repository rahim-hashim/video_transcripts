*  Ma'am, what do you think about the Pope being from Chicago? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2.0s)]
*  That doesn't excite you? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=8.0s)]

*  What is this article, man? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=125.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=130.0s)]
*  I miss my daughter. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=137.0s)]
*  Soon. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=141.0s)]
*  My friend has been taking care of her. Was like, talking about. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=143.0s)]

*  Oh, oh really? Oh nice. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=164.0s)]
*  Joey Salads responded to Hassanabi Productions. He said, dude got probably randomly selected and due to his support, they asked the correct questions. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=170.0s)]
*  These guys make no sense because it's like, okay, well then they released me into the wild. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=178.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like, what do you think is going on? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=183.0s)]
*  Like they. Like what is this argument? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=187.0s)]
*  I mean, I know these guys don't think too much, but it's crazy. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=191.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. The amount of blue check marks that are like, yes, the government should apprehend you for what you are saying is insane because every single one of them, if you trace back, you go back long enough on their profile. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=198.0s)]
*  On their profiles like you arrive at how much they love defending free speech and how much they abhor cancel culture. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=212.0s)]
*  And it turns out, I mean, we already knew this was the case, but it freaking turns out that they just their defense of free speech was simply saying slurs, being able to say slurs. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=219.0s)]
*  A surprise to no one. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=232.0s)]
*  Free speech in parentheses slurs. Exactly. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=236.0s)]
*  Free speech absolutism until until you say something about Israel and that hurts my feelings. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=240.0s)]
*  As my goals, dad was on a sun stream today and told him to lighten up on you. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=249.0s)]
*  Then as we responded by saying, but he interviewed it. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=253.0s)]
*  As my dad was defending me. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=257.0s)]
*  Hell, yeah. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=259.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=261.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. You drove past my work. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=279.0s)]

*  I'm back in Chicago. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=283.0s)]
*  Stay longer. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=289.0s)]
*  No. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=291.0s)]
*  I'll stream tomorrow. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=292.0s)]
*  No. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=293.0s)]
*  Go to the Bean. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=294.0s)]
*  You already have obligations. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=295.0s)]

*  Are you going to stay here if I stay longer? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=298.0s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=299.0s)]

*  You're not even going to be here. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=307.0s)]
*  I'm only here because the Pope. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=313.0s)]
*  Ma'am, what do you think about the Pope being from Chicago? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=315.0s)]
*  That doesn't excite you. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=321.0s)]

*  Are they leaving? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=498.0s)]
*  They're looking they renovated it once. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=499.0s)]
*  They put like a spaceship on top. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=501.0s)]
*  They put a spaceship on top? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=504.0s)]
*  Look. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=506.0s)]
*  I can't see from here. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=507.0s)]
*  Doesn't it look like a spaceship to you? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=508.0s)]
*  I can't see it from here, unfortunately. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=510.0s)]
*  You know what it was for a long time. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=511.0s)]
*  You have to look at it in an aerial view. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=512.0s)]
*  It goes like this. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=515.0s)]
*  They put a lot of box offices in there. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=516.0s)]
*  Uh huh. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=520.0s)]
*  That's cool. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=524.0s)]
*  They were looking to move. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=525.0s)]
*  They were looking to move out to the suburbs. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=526.0s)]
*  And now, you know, they've been going back and forth for three years. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=528.0s)]
*  So this is McCormick, the world's largest conference center. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=532.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=539.0s)]
*  That's fun. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=540.0s)]
*  It has four of those size buildings. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=541.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=543.0s)]
*  Chicago, the city of dreams. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=546.0s)]
*  That's what they the concrete jungle where dreams are made of. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=548.0s)]
*  There's there's no amount of conferences that you can't go to in Chicago. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=551.0s)]
*  Well, we've lost a lot of them. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=554.0s)]
*  Next to the unions. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=557.0s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=560.0s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=563.0s)]
*  What happened? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=564.0s)]
*  What did the unions do? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=565.0s)]
*  They're expensive. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=566.0s)]
*  You can't plug in your own light unless they do it for you. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=567.0s)]
*  Uh huh. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=570.0s)]
*  Two years on the other side of it. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=571.0s)]
*  We've lost some of the biggest shows, the hardware, the electronic show. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=574.0s)]
*  They moved over to Las Vegas. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=579.0s)]
*  They got unions there, too, though. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=582.0s)]
*  Yeah, but it's cheaper to operate there from what I understand. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=584.0s)]
*  Do we feel like it's the companies that moved that were being disrespectful to Chicago, the Chicago roots? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=587.0s)]
*  Not the not the, you know, able bodied, hardworking men and women. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=593.0s)]
*  Well, they tried to negotiate. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=601.0s)]
*  They wouldn't. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=604.0s)]
*  So now they're sharing a little, instead of sharing a little bit of something, they're sharing a whole lot of nothing. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=605.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=613.0s)]
*  And the city has lost millions of dollars in revenue. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=614.0s)]
*  We got to bring him back by force. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=617.0s)]
*  Trump style. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=619.0s)]
*  Trump's going to bring him back. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=620.0s)]
*  Me too. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=623.0s)]
*  That's what he keeps saying. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=628.0s)]
*  He keeps saying he's going to bring back industry to this country. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=629.0s)]
*  What do you think about the tariffs? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=632.0s)]
*  Manufacturing. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=634.0s)]
*  You think he'll bring back manufacturing? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=636.0s)]
*  That's the song they're singing. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=638.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=640.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=642.0s)]
*  This country was based on manufacturing. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=644.0s)]
*  What do you think about it? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=646.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=648.0s)]
*  It was an accountant that opened up the open trade and lost a lot of jobs. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=650.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=654.0s)]
*  You know, not dissimilar to the conference trades moving to Las Vegas, where the bosses, the company owners moved manufacturing to China and overseas so that they could get a cheaper alternative. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=656.0s)]
*  Oh, that's cheap. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=672.0s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=673.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=675.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=676.0s)]
*  That was crazy. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=677.0s)]
*  There was baby ducks. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=679.0s)]
*  Three baby ducks were running on the road. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=680.0s)]
*  I've never seen it. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=682.0s)]
*  Chicago. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=683.0s)]
*  You know why? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=684.0s)]
*  Because of the lake? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=685.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=686.0s)]
*  That's the deepest of the Great Lakes. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=687.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=690.0s)]
*  What is the beef? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=691.0s)]
*  What beef do you have with any other state? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=693.0s)]
*  Which is the least favorite of your Midwestern states? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=698.0s)]
*  I've never thought about it. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=704.0s)]
*  Wait, really? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=706.0s)]
*  You don't have like an InstaLock? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=707.0s)]
*  You don't have like Idaho? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=709.0s)]
*  Those guys. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=710.0s)]
*  Anything like that? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=711.0s)]
*  I've never even been there. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=713.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=717.0s)]
*  I mean that, that'll, okay, what about Wisconsin? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=720.0s)]
*  It's our neighbor. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=725.0s)]
*  Yeah, you with Wisconsin? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=727.0s)]
*  Yeah, cheese huts. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=729.0s)]
*  What's not to like, huh? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=732.0s)]
*  They call them cheese huts. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=733.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=734.0s)]
*  Like when they come for the games. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=735.0s)]
*  They play at the Miller Stadium up there, you know, where the Miller beer is made. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=738.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=747.0s)]
*  So. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=748.0s)]
*  What about Indiana? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=749.0s)]
*  If we keep going, we'll run into it. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=750.0s)]
*  It's cheaper to live there. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=751.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=752.0s)]
*  Less taxes. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=753.0s)]
*  And it sits along the lake too. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=754.0s)]
*  This lake neighbors two states, Michigan and Indiana. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=755.0s)]
*  What do you feel about, how do you feel about Michigan? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=772.0s)]
*  It's nice if you like to go boating. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=773.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=774.0s)]
*  It's a little, anything north of here is a little colder, you know. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=775.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=778.0s)]
*  Michigan's colder, Wisconsin's colder. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=779.0s)]
*  It's kind of cold here too. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=780.0s)]
*  It's like sneaky. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=781.0s)]
*  It's like, you know, it's like a little bit of a hot place. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=782.0s)]
*  It's kind of cold here too. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=783.0s)]
*  It's like sneaky cold. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=784.0s)]
*  Well, that's because they spray the sky with tum trails. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=785.0s)]
*  They change the temperature. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=786.0s)]
*  They control it. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=787.0s)]
*  You think so? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=788.0s)]
*  That's what they're doing? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=789.0s)]
*  I was saying more like, I was saying more like they say they, they, it's like 66 degrees, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=790.0s)]
*  right? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=803.0s)]
*  On my phone. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=804.0s)]
*  And then I come outside and it don't feel like 66 degrees. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=805.0s)]
*  You think they're. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=807.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=808.0s)]
*  You think they're manipulating that too? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=809.0s)]
*  Well, if you just look up, you'll see the line. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=810.0s)]
*  See those lines? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=816.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=817.0s)]
*  Those aren't clouds. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=818.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=819.0s)]
*  They're like planes that are flying around, I think. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=820.0s)]
*  They're military planes. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=825.0s)]
*  The warmer the climate, they spray more in warmer climate areas. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=828.0s)]
*  Uh huh. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=832.0s)]
*  Like Chicago? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=833.0s)]
*  No, like Texas, Arizona. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=834.0s)]
*  What do you think they do? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=837.0s)]
*  The chem trails. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=838.0s)]
*  Well, the government just started being honest about it. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=839.0s)]
*  I mean, there's a whole, if you Google it, you'll get a whole readout on it. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=843.0s)]
*  I'm going to look this up. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=850.0s)]
*  Do your own research. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=851.0s)]
*  I'm going to, I'm going to. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=852.0s)]
*  You can get allergies from it. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=853.0s)]
*  It's affecting people and their health issues and stuff. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=854.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=859.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=860.0s)]

*  I do. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=862.0s)]
*  Wait, really? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=863.0s)]
*  What do you, what do you got? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=864.0s)]
*  Let me guess. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=865.0s)]
*  Wait, hold on. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=866.0s)]
*  I'm allergic to gluten. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=867.0s)]
*  I'm allergic to the environment. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=868.0s)]
*  What, like, oh, like pollen? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=871.0s)]
*  No, like chem trails. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=874.0s)]
*  Oh, so you don't have like. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=876.0s)]
*  I've been hearing jet fuel for 25 years and never had a problem. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=878.0s)]
*  You think the chem trails are new is what you're saying. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=882.0s)]
*  They're not new. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=885.0s)]
*  They've been going on for over 25 years. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=886.0s)]
*  People just aren't aware. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=888.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=890.0s)]
*  But it didn't like create any specific allergies. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=892.0s)]
*  You're saying like you're just allergic to the environment. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=894.0s)]
*  Well, that's what the hospital said, but. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=897.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=900.0s)]
*  I have my doubts. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=901.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=903.0s)]
*  You don't, you don't believe in the doctors? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=904.0s)]
*  They might, they might be in on the chem trails thing. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=906.0s)]
*  I believe in it, but I'm just saying. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=909.0s)]
*  I mean, after, like, I've been driving a limo forever and I've never had an issue with inhaling jet fuel. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=911.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=918.0s)]
*  Because we're close to it all the time by over here. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=919.0s)]
*  And then. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=922.0s)]
*  And for a while I just started getting runny noses and runny eyes. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=926.0s)]
*  And when I went to get my blood tests, they said that I was allergic to the environment. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=931.0s)]
*  And it's, you know, the chem trails, they caught up to me because I'm outside all day, you know. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=937.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=941.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=943.0s)]
*  I mean, hopefully, hopefully it doesn't, it doesn't impact us as well. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=945.0s)]
*  March. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=949.0s)]
*  Well, I ran into a professor once that was down in Arizona. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=950.0s)]
*  And she would have got her blood test done. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=954.0s)]
*  It came out that she had over like 10 different chemicals in her blood. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=958.0s)]
*  She was a retired senior professor and it was all from the chem trails. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=961.0s)]
*  Many such cases. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=967.0s)]
*  I feel like. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=969.0s)]
*  They had a big meeting on it. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=970.0s)]
*  So you don't, you don't trust the government at all. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=973.0s)]
*  I assume. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=975.0s)]
*  I'm just saying they spray the skies with chemicals. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=976.0s)]
*  But do you think it's like both parties are doing it? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=979.0s)]
*  Like Democrats and Republicans? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=982.0s)]
*  Or do you think like Democrats are doing it less and then the Republicans are doing it more or vice versa? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=983.0s)]
*  You know what? It's been going on for so long I couldn't even tell you. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=990.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=993.0s)]
*  Couldn't even tell you because. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=995.0s)]
*  I used to have a white limo before. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1002.0s)]
*  Uh huh. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1005.0s)]
*  And there was. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1006.0s)]
*  And I didn't live too far from O'Hare, you know. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1008.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1011.0s)]
*  Sometimes the car would have like a film. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1012.0s)]
*  Of like, it would look like antifreeze on it. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1016.0s)]
*  And then if you look up in the sky. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1021.0s)]
*  You would see the. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1023.0s)]
*  The chuckle boards, you know, we call them chuckle boards because they spray. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1026.0s)]
*  The thing that's happening here is like it'll be nice and sunny in the morning. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1030.0s)]
*  I don't see none right now. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1036.0s)]
*  But then they ride around. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1038.0s)]
*  They might be hiding. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1039.0s)]
*  What? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1041.0s)]
*  I'm looking up right now. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1042.0s)]
*  The sun? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1043.0s)]
*  No, no, I'm saying I don't see the chemtrails. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1044.0s)]
*  Because they spread out. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1046.0s)]
*  Uh. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1047.0s)]
*  They widen. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1048.0s)]
*  It's not like a commercial airline. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1049.0s)]
*  So when you, what about like when you see commercial airliners also spraying? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1053.0s)]
*  Like also leaving like a trail. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1058.0s)]
*  The chemtrails don't. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1060.0s)]
*  They spread out and they block the sun. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1062.0s)]
*  You watch. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1064.0s)]
*  Don't be surprised when you come out. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1065.0s)]
*  It'll be cloudy. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1066.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, I'm going to be I'm going to be paying close attention to this, I think. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1068.0s)]
*  But I mean, it goes on all over the world. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1072.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1075.0s)]
*  I mean, look at see, look at that. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1076.0s)]
*  That's not a real cloud. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1078.0s)]
*  That's not a real cloud. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1079.0s)]
*  They sprayed in the morning. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1080.0s)]
*  They spray almost every day. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1082.0s)]
*  What other? [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1084.0s)]
*  What other things do you believe? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1085.0s)]
*  That we might not be aware of like chemtrails and stuff that you think the government might be? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1087.0s)]
*  You know, down in Central America and South America, you know, they have those really big floods. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1103.0s)]
*  Where like complete villages just wash away. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1109.0s)]
*  Do they? [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1115.0s)]
*  I don't. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1116.0s)]
*  And that's been going on for a while. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1117.0s)]
*  You know, that's part of bioengineering weather. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1118.0s)]
*  You think you think someone's like making big floods to wash away villages? [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1121.0s)]
*  Google bioengineering weather. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1126.0s)]
*  Like the H.A.A.R.P. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1128.0s)]
*  Like the weather machine is that what you're talking about? [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1130.0s)]
*  I'm not sure you have to look it up. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1132.0s)]
*  You know about that? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1134.0s)]
*  You should Google that one. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1135.0s)]
*  H.A.A.R.P. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1137.0s)]
*  I will. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1138.0s)]
*  It's when massive earthquakes and stuff happen, people speculate that it's because of [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1139.0s)]
*  the underground tunnels. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1144.0s)]
*  Whoa, I didn't know about that. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1147.0s)]
*  Wait, there's underground tunnels. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1149.0s)]
*  Whoa, you are spitting game right now. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1151.0s)]
*  That's what are the underground tunnels? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1153.0s)]
*  From east to west. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1157.0s)]
*  Like across the entire country or just in Chicago? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1159.0s)]
*  Wait, do you say Chicago or Chicago? [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1164.0s)]
*  Many such cases. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1167.0s)]
*  Like shush. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1169.0s)]
*  Like Chicago. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1171.0s)]
*  Why do I hear people go Chicago? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1173.0s)]
*  Because they're probably Mexican and they have an accent. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1175.0s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1178.0s)]
*  Like Chevy. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1180.0s)]
*  Hey, look at the Obama. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1182.0s)]
*  What is this? [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1184.0s)]
*  Is this the Obama Library? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1185.0s)]
*  I think it's a museum. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1187.0s)]
*  He's building a museum, huh? [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1189.0s)]
*  Not sure. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1191.0s)]
*  It looks like a person to me, but what do I know? [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1192.0s)]
*  The Panopticon. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1194.0s)]
*  You nailed it. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1196.0s)]
*  This is the beginning of the campus. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1198.0s)]
*  It's beautiful. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1201.0s)]
*  Yeah, whatever that monstrosity was, the Obamas are building is not exactly the best looking thing I've seen. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1205.0s)]
*  Beautiful campus, though. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1219.0s)]
*  It is a beautiful campus. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1222.0s)]
*  College campuses are beautiful because they're 15-minute cities, you know? [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1224.0s)]
*  It's walkable. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1229.0s)]
*  There's public transit. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1231.0s)]
*  But I guess Chicago already has public transit, too. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1233.0s)]
*  So there's that. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1240.0s)]
*  How does Chicago feel about Obama? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1252.0s)]
*  He used to work here. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1257.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1259.0s)]
*  And then he lost touch with his roots. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1263.0s)]
*  You think so? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1266.0s)]
*  I think so. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1267.0s)]
*  You know Jeremiah Wright? [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1269.0s)]
*  That was his pastor. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1272.0s)]
*  And he sold him out when he became president because people were complaining about Jeremiah Wright saying, you know, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1274.0s)]
*  God damn any country, including America, that has enslaved its population, which I think was a correct assessment that he made. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1281.0s)]
*  And Obama was like, oh, I don't know that guy. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1289.0s)]
*  Fake friend. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1292.0s)]
*  I stand with Jeremiah Wright. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1295.0s)]
*  That's in the Bible. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1301.0s)]
*  That's what he said. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1302.0s)]

*  Okay. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1935.1599999999999s)]
*  Here, take this one. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1936.1599999999999s)]
*  I do not recommend you go down. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1937.1599999999999s)]
*  Oh, no, no. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1938.1599999999999s)]
*  You will not be able to leave. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1939.1599999999999s)]
*  Can I, should I wait? [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1941.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I just want to take a look. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1946.1599999999999s)]
*  I'm going to read. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1948.2s)]
*  So I heard that there was some controversy with the Chicago Jewish Coalition, I think. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1959.2s)]
*  I... [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1967.2s)]
*  They said they were going to bring counter-pro-festers or something. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1968.2s)]
*  I have not seen evidence of that yet. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1971.2s)]
*  We definitely got some letters. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1973.2s)]
*  When I did a USC, when I spoke at USC, a professor invited me and there was like a massive... [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1976.24s)]
*  Apparently, I didn't even know about this until later, but there was apparently a massive letter writing campaign. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1986.24s)]
*  27,000 emails were sent. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1991.24s)]
*  And I mean, it's always like... [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1995.24s)]
*  It's also ridiculous things like it's just untrue or they'll... [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=1999.24s)]
*  They'll say stuff like, I got banned for racism from Twitch, which is true, but it's because I engaged in anti-white racism. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2006.24s)]
*  I said cracker. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2016.24s)]
*  So they won't say that part when they write an email. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2018.24s)]
*  They'll just simply say he got banned off Twitch for racism. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2021.24s)]
*  But if you were to investigate it a little bit further, you're like, oh, that's not like a real thing. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2024.24s)]
*  That is portrayed. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2030.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2031.24s)]
*  Do you find though... [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2032.28s)]
*  I mean, we're very proud of our traditions here. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2035.28s)]
*  We speak up in this course, so we get it from all sides. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2041.28s)]
*  We had a DHS official here a couple weeks ago. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2046.28s)]
*  We had a lot of protests after protests inside the event. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2050.28s)]
*  So I don't mean to portray it as if all of our events are protested. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2054.28s)]
*  In fact, 98% are not. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2057.28s)]
*  But we definitely hear from all sides all the time. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2059.32s)]
*  Would have loved to see the DHS guy. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2063.32s)]
*  I just got apprehended. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2066.32s)]
*  Do you know what happened at ORD, right? [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2069.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2071.32s)]
*  You were from Paris? [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2072.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2073.32s)]
*  What happened? [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2074.32s)]
*  They just asked me about... [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2076.32s)]
*  I mean, they pulled me to the side, put me in a detention area. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2078.32s)]
*  Solo by yourself. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2081.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2082.32s)]
*  And then... [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2083.32s)]
*  Well, the first detention area was where there were a lot of people, mostly... [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2084.32s)]
*  Mostly non-citizens with visas that were just traveling into the United States. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2088.36s)]
*  But then they take you to a second room where they interrogate you. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2094.36s)]
*  And they asked me about whether I like Trump or not. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2100.36s)]
*  Like, really insane things. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2104.36s)]
*  You have a U.S. passport. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2106.36s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I'm an American citizen. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2107.36s)]
*  I was born here. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2108.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2111.36s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2113.36s)]
*  Yup. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2115.36s)]
*  They asked me about my opinions on the war, on Israel-Palestine. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2116.4s)]
*  They kept trying to get something out of me where they were like, [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2122.4s)]
*  do you like the Houthis? [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2126.4s)]
*  Do you support Hamas? [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2127.4s)]
*  Do you support Hamas? [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2128.4s)]
*  Do you think they're just like resistance or are they a terrorist group? [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2129.4s)]
*  Do you think they're resistance or are they a terrorist group? [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2132.4s)]
*  It was pretty wild. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2135.4s)]
*  Did you have any other U.S. citizens with you? [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2136.4s)]
*  Did you have any other U.S. citizens with you? [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2140.44s)]
*  So I looked around to see if there was anyone with a passport [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2142.44s)]
*  and they were coming out and like holding up passports. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2146.44s)]
*  And I also asked some of the people that were around me [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2148.44s)]
*  if they had American passports or not. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2152.44s)]
*  And none of the people around me had American passports. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2154.44s)]
*  There was only one other person in the room that I saw [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2156.44s)]
*  actually had a blue passport. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2159.44s)]
*  I assume it was an American one. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2160.44s)]
*  But everybody else was not American. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2162.44s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2166.44s)]
*  So how did they finally release you? [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2167.48s)]
*  What was the question? [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2169.48s)]
*  They just questioned me. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2170.48s)]
*  Kept me in there for like two hours. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2171.48s)]
*  They said, do you like Donald Trump? [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2175.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2176.48s)]
*  So how did you answer that? [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2177.48s)]
*  Oh, I just straight up told them no. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2178.48s)]
*  I was like, no. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2180.48s)]
*  And now what was the follow up to that? [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2181.48s)]
*  That was one of those questions where I responded. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2183.48s)]
*  But I was like, what does this have to do with anything? [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2187.48s)]
*  I literally was like, why are you asking me this? [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2189.48s)]
*  And there was no real follow up to it. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2192.52s)]
*  What was your, where did you travel originally? [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2197.52s)]
*  France. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2201.52s)]
*  Oh, so this was just a round trip to France. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2202.52s)]
*  You went from where you lived to Paris. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2204.52s)]
*  I went from Los Angeles to France with my family [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2206.52s)]
*  for Mother's Day. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2209.52s)]
*  And I came back early so I could do this. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2211.52s)]
*  And yeah, I got stopped at the point of entry. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2214.52s)]
*  And I have global entry too. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2219.52s)]
*  Wow. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2221.56s)]
*  Why did you choose to go to France for Mother's Day? [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2222.56s)]
*  Just for family or do you have family? [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2224.56s)]
*  Once a year. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2225.56s)]
*  No, once a year we have a... [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2226.56s)]
*  A baby reunion type of get together type of thing. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2229.56s)]
*  Yeah, we go somewhere once a year. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2231.56s)]
*  You maybe think of something... [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2234.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2237.56s)]
*  It's looking good. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2238.56s)]
*  How do you like the house? [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2240.56s)]
*  Looks nice, right? [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2241.56s)]
*  It's great. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2242.56s)]
*  Yeah, I'm gonna get the bike. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2243.56s)]
*  Is it packed? [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2244.56s)]
*  It's filling up for sure. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2245.56s)]
*  It will be. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2246.56s)]
*  What's up, man? [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2247.56s)]
*  Hi, I'm baby. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2248.56s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2249.56s)]
*  I appreciate that. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2250.6s)]
*  Where do you live in Nellis? [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2253.6s)]
*  I live in West Hollywood. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2254.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2258.6s)]
*  I think it's good. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2259.6s)]
*  It looks a little red. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2260.6s)]
*  It's a little blown out. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2261.6s)]
*  Oh, it's blown out. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2262.6s)]
*  It's always more blown out on Twitch than it is on this camera for some reason. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2263.6s)]
*  I'm not surprised. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2267.6s)]
*  I'm surprised that they came in early. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2268.6s)]
*  But I've learned to copy and paste before. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2269.6s)]
*  Just because you're back home. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2271.6s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2272.6s)]
*  Kobe. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2273.6s)]
*  We have over registration obviously and a wait list. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2274.6s)]
*  We'll go to witness before we do anything. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2277.6s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2279.64s)]
*  I feel like filming and we're taking photos and these things and stuff because the beautiful [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2293.64s)]
*  part is the view. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2297.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2298.64s)]
*  But you can't shoot that way because it's so... [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2299.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2301.64s)]
*  It's so funny. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2302.64s)]
*  It's time to go, yeah. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2303.64s)]
*  But then the rest of the room is just nothing. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2305.64s)]
*  It's just like, well. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2306.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2307.64s)]
*  You've never been to Chicago campus before, right? [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2308.68s)]
*  I've never been to Chicago. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2309.68s)]
*  I've never been to University of Chicago campus, no. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2310.68s)]
*  You've been to Chicago. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2313.68s)]
*  The only time I've ever been to Chicago was for the DNC. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2314.68s)]
*  Really? [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2318.68s)]
*  And I was in and out then too, so I didn't get to see the city. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2319.68s)]
*  Oh, you didn't get to see this trip either. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2321.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2323.68s)]
*  Well, you're River Nords, right? [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2324.68s)]
*  That's where you were? [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2325.68s)]
*  That's where you're staying? [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2326.68s)]
*  No. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2327.68s)]
*  What? [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2328.68s)]
*  I'm staying at the Langley. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2329.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2330.68s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2331.68s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2332.68s)]
*  So you got a little visual tour. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2333.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2334.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2335.68s)]
*  I mean, I see the boats and stuff, so that's cool. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2336.72s)]
*  This is the whole campus. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2339.72s)]
*  This is kind of the neo-Gothic. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2340.72s)]
*  That's the chapel. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2343.72s)]
*  It's like, I don't know, 50 years old. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2344.72s)]
*  It's sick. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2346.72s)]
*  No, the campus is beautiful. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2347.72s)]
*  This is. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2348.72s)]
*  Do you see the outside? [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2349.72s)]
*  Obviously, you saw the outside. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2350.72s)]
*  I saw a little bit of the outside of the building. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2351.72s)]
*  This is a new building, right? [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2352.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2353.72s)]
*  This one's very new. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2354.72s)]
*  This came up in 2020. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2355.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2356.72s)]
*  I think it's incongruous with the rest of the campus. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2357.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2360.72s)]
*  But I guess they made that design decision to make it modern. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2361.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2366.7599999999998s)]
*  This is that building? [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2367.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2368.7599999999998s)]
*  I think it's a conference center, so. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2369.7599999999998s)]
*  Were you aura farming? [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2372.7599999999998s)]
*  You were aura farming. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2374.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm just standing. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2375.7599999999998s)]
*  You went out there to look outside. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2376.7599999999998s)]
*  I was just looking outside. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2378.7599999999998s)]
*  So you could be in the backdrop. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2379.7599999999998s)]
*  I was just looking outside. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2381.7599999999998s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2382.7599999999998s)]
*  Are you live streaming right now? [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2383.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2385.7599999999998s)]
*  Oh, are we on mic? [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2386.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2387.7599999999998s)]
*  OK, this is not off the record. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2388.7599999999998s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2389.7599999999998s)]
*  No. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2390.8s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2391.8s)]
*  We're always live. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2392.8s)]
*  OK. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2393.8s)]
*  That is? [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2394.8s)]
*  Is it almost like a break for you to speak in front of people instead of in front of [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2395.8s)]
*  a camera? [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2400.8s)]
*  They'll still be in front of the camera when they... [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2401.8s)]
*  Well, that's true. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2402.8s)]
*  I guess you're right. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2403.8s)]
*  They'll be at two cameras. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2404.8s)]
*  I mean, it is a little bit like a break, for sure. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2405.8s)]
*  I think it's a break because then I don't have like 40,000 micromanagers constantly [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2408.8s)]
*  trying to get my attention. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2414.8s)]
*  So in that regard, it's like... [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2416.8s)]
*  It's one person. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2418.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2419.84s)]
*  It's much easier to perform. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2420.84s)]
*  And how many events of this type do you tend to do a year? [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2423.84s)]
*  I used to... [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2430.84s)]
*  I never used to do them. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2431.84s)]
*  I got invited a lot and I would just say no until I did the USC one and it was like really [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2432.84s)]
*  good. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2437.84s)]
*  It was well received. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2438.84s)]
*  And on top of that, we were able to film the whole thing. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2439.84s)]
*  So it's cool. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2442.84s)]
*  So now I do it more frequently. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2443.84s)]
*  I did Oxford and Cambridge and then this is my fourth one, I guess, technically. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2445.88s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2451.88s)]
*  Okay. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2452.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2453.88s)]
*  Cool. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2454.88s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like college... [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2455.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2456.88s)]
*  I mean, I'm not a famous person, but I feel like college is getting nice. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2457.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2460.88s)]
*  Like from... [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2461.88s)]
*  Audience reception is really good. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2462.88s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it is most of my audience. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2464.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2467.88s)]
*  I love it though. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2468.88s)]
*  You were even younger than 33, I thought you were. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2469.88s)]
*  It was like... [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2474.92s)]
*  Thank you for saying that. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2475.92s)]
*  Except for the little white, right? [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2477.92s)]
*  Yeah, I do have white beard hairs, which give it away. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2479.92s)]
*  But no, I'm 33. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2485.92s)]
*  I'm an old man now by the standards of being an internet superstar. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2487.92s)]
*  I wouldn't say superstar, but... [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2492.92s)]
*  On status. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2499.92s)]
*  So we're starting at 5.30. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2504.92s)]
*  Yeah, we start on time. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2507.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2508.92s)]
*  About to set up a light. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2509.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2511.92s)]
*  Are you connecting to the audio? [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2512.92s)]
*  No, we're just running it all off this. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2517.92s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2519.92s)]
*  I'm gonna have them both logged up. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2520.92s)]
*  Yeah, we're gonna give this instead a microphone. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2523.92s)]
*  So, and then there'll be lab mics for our stuff too? [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2527.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2532.92s)]
*  It just not works fine. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2533.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2534.96s)]
*  It'll be re-entered? [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2535.96s)]
*  No, they won't interfere. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2536.96s)]
*  Yeah, that'll be good. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2537.96s)]
*  And then, you know the speaker, like, if any students ask these questions, [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2538.96s)]
*  you know if they'll have a microphone or are they just gonna be speaking to it? [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2543.96s)]
*  There'll be a standard standing mic. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2546.96s)]
*  Okay, great. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2547.96s)]
*  We usually do them on like two sides of the room. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2548.96s)]
*  The reason I ask is typically like if there's a microphone and a speaker, [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2550.96s)]
*  then like their mics will pick up the room and it'll be sound fine. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2554.96s)]
*  But if not, then I could be conscious of like handing them the microphone. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2558.96s)]
*  Oh, no, they'll be standing mics and they'll pick it up really well. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2562.0s)]
*  That should be fine. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2565.0s)]
*  Perfect. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2569.0s)]
*  I've been getting blown up with the news reports coming out. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2573.0s)]
*  Is it because of the airport? [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2578.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2580.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2581.0s)]
*  I mean, I feel like it's such a stupid decision for them to do that to someone like myself. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2582.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2587.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2588.04s)]
*  Because I'm gonna talk about it. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2589.04s)]
*  And I'm somewhat of a high profile political commentator. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2590.04s)]
*  Oh, no, this has been happening. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2600.04s)]
*  I knew that it was already happening. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2602.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2609.04s)]
*  Hey. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=2612.04s)]

*  Everyone else is just lying. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3075.08s)]
*  You know, he is, he is from Chicago. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3076.08s)]

*  I mean, that's what I like about Pope Francis and this. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3101.08s)]
*  Pope is like, it's not really about, it's not than he lived here. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3104.08s)]
*  The fact that he hasn't lived here. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3111.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3113.08s)]

*  Yeah, I mean he has not, I think, even talked about being the first American Pope. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3119.08s)]
*  No. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3126.08s)]
*  So, like, I saw like Lester Holt did something like, was that some event, or yesterday, like [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3127.08s)]
*  talked to him for like five seconds and said when you come to America, he said no plans [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3132.08s)]
*  to. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3137.08s)]
*  He didn't even speak English at his ceremony. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3138.08s)]
*  He only spoke Spanish and Latin. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3141.08s)]
*  And I was like, when is he going to the English version? [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3143.08s)]
*  Yeah, why? [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3146.08s)]

*  ago or something? [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3156.08s)]
*  I know. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3157.08s)]

*  Oh really? [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3161.08s)]
*  No, he definitely, he speaks English. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3162.08s)]
*  More importantly, he speaks baseball. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3164.08s)]
*  That's the whole standard right there. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3167.08s)]
*  Well, his brother's here too. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3170.08s)]
*  But I like that he doesn't speak English. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3172.08s)]
*  Like, that's good. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3174.08s)]
*  He's trying to shelter that side. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3175.08s)]
*  He's trying to hide that side from the public. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3180.08s)]
*  I respect that. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3182.08s)]
*  We know he can tweet in English. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3184.08s)]

*  I love, oh god, that's so awesome. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3189.08s)]
*  You just gave me a lecture on how students get a better grade than my brother. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3192.08s)]
*  This is different, I think, because stupid elements. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3197.08s)]
*  Because we like them. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3201.08s)]
*  And because we like them. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3203.08s)]
*  No, this is different. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3205.08s)]
*  That's why. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3207.08s)]
*  Okay. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3209.08s)]
*  Nobody likes JD Vans. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3211.08s)]
*  I really would weigh on me if I met the Pope and he died the next day. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3218.08s)]
*  I would weigh on my spirit. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3222.08s)]
*  As also an adult convert too. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3224.08s)]
*  Yeah, I would weigh on my spirit. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3226.08s)]
*  He's an adultist, JD. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3228.08s)]
*  He's an adult convert to Catholicism. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3230.08s)]
*  And he's one of those guys that's like, the current teachings of the Catholic Church focus too much on the poor. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3234.08s)]
*  The adult converts are always very like... [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3242.08s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3244.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3246.08s)]
*  The zealotry of a convert. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3248.08s)]
*  But in their case, or revert. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3252.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3254.08s)]
*  But in the case of that, aren't they also not necessarily indoctrinated as a form of Catholic tradition in terms of charity? [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3256.08s)]
*  I think the doctors take the doctorate part very seriously and I feel like the folks who grow up in it are more so living the vibes. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3264.08s)]
*  What they learn all their life is children. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3274.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3278.08s)]
*  You need lifelong guilt. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3280.08s)]
*  And like, you know, drinking problems. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3282.08s)]
*  Otherwise you're not a real one. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3284.08s)]
*  You can't just get indoctrinated to it. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3286.08s)]
*  I had no real interaction with Catholics much growing up. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3290.08s)]
*  And like, you know, those black folks who were largely Christian and the white folks were largely Jewish. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3294.08s)]
*  When I went to Marquette, which is a Catholic school, I remember Ash Wednesday, I was like, whoa, what is going on? [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3300.08s)]
*  I've never seen people with like... [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3306.08s)]
*  Like what happened to them? [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3308.08s)]
*  I literally called my parents and I was like, why are these white people? [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3310.08s)]
*  I was stuck on their heads like, what is going on? [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3312.08s)]
*  This is where his doctorate in theology is at. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3314.08s)]
*  I never saw that until I came to America as well. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3318.08s)]
*  Protestants don't do that? [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3326.08s)]
*  Do they have like traditions like that? [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3328.08s)]
*  Yeah, but they don't. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3330.08s)]
*  Not in the same way. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3332.08s)]
*  It's not as rigid. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3334.08s)]
*  It's not as ritualistic. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3336.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's not as ritualistic. It's not as uniform. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3338.08s)]
*  I like that though. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3340.08s)]
*  I like that about Catholicism. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3342.08s)]
*  I think there's power to that. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3344.08s)]
*  I like, yeah, I think it's fun. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3346.08s)]
*  Also, the churches all have like pieces of bone from the saints. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3350.08s)]
*  Hi. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3358.08s)]

*  Nice to meet you. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3368.08s)]
*  I'm live by the way, just so you guys know. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3370.08s)]
*  No, no, it's okay. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3372.08s)]
*  It's fine. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3374.08s)]
*  How should we go about it so far? [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3376.08s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3378.08s)]
*  Interesting introduction. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3380.08s)]
*  Have you ever been to High Park? [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3382.08s)]
*  No, I have not. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3384.08s)]
*  I heard a lot about it from my buddies that grew up here though. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3386.08s)]
*  It was your idea to bring me by the way. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3388.08s)]
*  Oh wow, okay. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3392.08s)]
*  Like, hey, who would you love to see on campus? [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3394.08s)]
*  What made you want me to come on? [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3396.08s)]
*  I think it was probably like at the peak of the craziness of the election, [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3402.08s)]
*  I was like, okay, we're just hearing from pundits and like they're deciding that they're [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3406.08s)]
*  into some things. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3412.08s)]
*  Wrong. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3414.08s)]
*  And they were so wrong. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3416.08s)]
*  Whereas I was not. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3418.08s)]
*  It's like it's time we hear about, you know, someone from, like, let's not like see it, [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3420.08s)]
*  like hear their opinion and like what they think. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3424.08s)]
*  If we have a community like that. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3426.08s)]
*  You're saying they can start like, like, say what they think. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3428.08s)]
*  We can give their opinions and also like relate to a group and a community of people who [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3430.08s)]
*  know the rest of it. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3432.08s)]
*  I think we're young and we have different values and I think sometimes he just speaks [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3434.08s)]
*  a little bit more poignantly to that than like Anderson Cooper, no hate to Anderson Cooper. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3438.08s)]
*  Yeah, no, the old's got it wrong. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3444.08s)]
*  So, sorry. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3446.08s)]
*  Sorry Anderson. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3448.08s)]
*  I get to speak in Chicago now. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3450.08s)]
*  And why do you think that is? [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3454.08s)]
*  Why do I think the old's got it wrong? [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3456.08s)]
*  It would be too interesting to agree on, right? [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3460.08s)]
*  Don't worry. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3462.08s)]
*  I can speak for hours. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3464.08s)]
*  It's not a problem. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3466.08s)]
*  Why do I think the old's got it wrong? [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3468.08s)]
*  They are too insulated in their bubbles. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3470.08s)]
*  Like the DC punditry. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3472.08s)]
*  And it's the same as like the politicians in general too. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3474.08s)]
*  Like they're so insulated from like normal people. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3480.08s)]
*  I think maybe there was more, I mean it depends on which era they were talking about. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3484.08s)]
*  But there was more of a direct line of communication between like different interest groups. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3488.08s)]
*  Like efforts from unions for example that I think kept at least like the Democrats a little bit [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3492.08s)]
*  aligned with the values of the working class. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3496.08s)]
*  But I think that's a good point. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3500.08s)]
*  I think that's a good point. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3502.08s)]

*  Èm Hy, Wanna Party trending right now... [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3540.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah! [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3543.08s)]
*  Yeah, I think most... [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3544.08s)]
*  I have a belief that... [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3546.08s)]
*  Yes most Americans... [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3548.08s)]
*  I mean, there's a duopoly... [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3550.08s)]
*  They don't have any real... [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3552.08s)]
*  They don't have any real option [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3554.08s)]
*  for making genuine change in their lives. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3556.08s)]
*  And I feel like more and more people are just completely tapped out of that process in general. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3560.08s)]
*  Like there's no real material change that they can vote for anyway so it's [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3566.08s)]
*  enough for them to be swayed by whatever their media diet is telling them. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3573.08s)]
*  But nowadays I feel like there's more access and people can make up their own [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3579.64s)]
*  conclusions for better or for worse and in most circumstances for worse for sure. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3584.68s)]
*  I mean we were driving up here and the and the lady that was driving us was [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3589.48s)]
*  immediately I love talking to drivers like Uber drivers. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3593.04s)]
*  It's like become like a running bit on our broadcast and this lady I would say [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3597.48s)]
*  like three questions in started talking about chemtrails very seriously and about [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3603.1200000000003s)]
*  how she has conversation was so normal. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3607.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah no she like I was like do you fuck with the pope. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3610.92s)]
*  Like what do you think the post from Chicago. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3613.8s)]
*  She's like I don't care. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3615.08s)]
*  And I was like oh cool. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3616.2400000000002s)]
*  Like she has an interesting perspective on this. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3617.1200000000003s)]
*  And then out of nowhere she was like chemtrails are making me sick. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3619.7599999999998s)]
*  And I went to the doctor and the doctor told me I am allergic to the environment [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3623.9199999999996s)]
*  and it's because of the chemtrails. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3627.56s)]
*  And it's like you arrived at that because you're doing too much online. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3629.56s)]
*  Like you are too online. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3634.12s)]

*  about the Red Sea. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3694.16s)]

*  What's your thesis? [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3697.72s)]
*  It's basically about from like late Ottoman period to post-colonial political time how [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3699.64s)]
*  the successive like power shifts from Ottoman to British to various French and Italian powers [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3707.7999999999997s)]
*  like shifted this shared norm. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3715.08s)]
*  There were norms for like social norms, cultural norms but also like trade and like maritime [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3718.04s)]
*  law specifically. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3723.72s)]
*  Ah okay. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3724.92s)]

*  And now today we have a lot of like I feel like the Red Sea is a new zone for power politics [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3729.24s)]
*  with the port stuff. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3735.4399999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcfVCKHbejE&t=3736.4399999999996s)]
