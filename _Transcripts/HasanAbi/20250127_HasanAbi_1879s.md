*  See they went into the real estate business. They did it unconventionally. They did it with guns [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=73.84s)]

*  We're tracking down the illegal alien criminals. We're detaining them and we are throwing them the hell out of our country [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=87.76s)]
*  We have no apologies and we're moving forward very fast. They're very dangerous people [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=94.72s)]
*  They're very dangerous people. They're violent people. I used to say these are more violent than our criminals [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=99.4s)]
*  In fact, the best part about them is they make our criminals look quite nice actually by comparison. They have very violent people [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=105.44s)]
*  We also have many violent criminals in our country. However, that did not necessarily come here illegally [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=112.2s)]
*  But I've been arrested 30 times 35 times 41 42 times in a couple of cases [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=118.48s)]
*  25 times 18 times [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=125.08s)]
*  many for murder and other heinous charges such as pushing people into subways as [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=127.92s)]
*  The trains coming along at 45 miles an hour bomb you get into the subway. They had it last week [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=133.6s)]
*  Getting them in the head with baseball bats while they're not looking [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=140.52s)]
*  Punching old ladies in the face knocking them unconscious and stealing their purse [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=144.08s)]
*  They even break into apartments and rape elderly women and beat up elderly men beat them to hell [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=148.68s)]
*  And I don't want these violent repeat offenders in our country anymore than I want illegal aliens from other countries who misbehave [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=153.84s)]
*  And [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=163.84s)]
*  I say and this is subject to getting it approved [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=165.52s)]
*  but if they've been arrested many many times they're repeat offenders by [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  By many numbers. I want them out of our country. I also will will be seeking permission to [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=173.64000000000001s)]
*  Do so we're gonna get approval hopefully to get them the hell out of our country along with others [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=180.92000000000002s)]
*  Let them be brought to a foreign land and maintained by others for a very small fee as opposed to be maintained in our jails [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  For massive amounts of money including the private prison companies that charge us a fortune [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=192.88s)]
*  Now let them be brought out of our country and let them live there for a while. Let's see how they like it [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=198.0s)]
*  You'll see crime all over the country dry up essentially. That's what Venezuela and other countries are doing [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=202.56s)]
*  they're getting rid of their criminals and putting them into the United States of America and [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=207.88s)]
*  Their crime is down by almost 80 percent [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=212.8s)]
*  We're going to restore law and order in America [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=216.6s)]
*  And we want to bring back the death penalty for these horrible people that people [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=219.36s)]
*  They people [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=225.28s)]
*  It's always a tough thing to say because I don't like it. Nobody likes it, but if you don't do it, we're just [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=227.72s)]
*  We're just looking for trouble. I spent a lot of time with President Xi and I'll never forget in my first meeting. I said [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=235.0s)]
*  You have a drug problem. No, no, no, we have a drug problem [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=242.32s)]
*  No, no, no, we have no drug problem. Why is that? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=245.23999999999998s)]
*  Quick trial what is quick trial quick trial is we try the piece the person that sells the drugs immediately and [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=248.76s)]
*  at the end of the day we [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=255.64s)]
*  Execute that person if that person is guilty. We have no drug problem whatsoever and [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=257.76s)]
*  That's the most severe case but but wherever you have no drug problem [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=264.24s)]
*  So and drugs causes a lot of the prime a lot of the crime in our country is caused by drugs [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=270.26s)]
*  it's a terrible situation comes through the [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=275.22s)]
*  southern border most of it is fentanyl coming in from [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=277.94s)]
*  China and you know, it's very interesting China when I was with President Xi [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=282.38s)]
*  I had a deal worked out with him that they were going to give their maximum punishment [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=286.66s)]
*  Which is the death penalty anybody making fentanyl and sending it into the United States then we had a very unusual [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=291.28000000000003s)]
*  Result in an election we had a rigged election. We had a very unusual result and [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=298.02000000000004s)]
*  That went nowhere was all set to be he would have absolutely done it [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=303.74s)]
*  He was ready. We shook hands on it and then Biden of course didn't follow it up [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=307.38s)]
*  He didn't follow anything up. But if that would have happened, you would have had a lot less fentanyl deaths [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=310.58000000000004s)]
*  I can tell you you would have had very little fentanyl coming into the southern border shit last week [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=315.18s)]
*  I also signed an order that will designate at the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=320.34000000000003s)]
*  That's a very big designation [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=326.34000000000003s)]
*  And as we are fighting mostly but others stop complaining [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=329.94s)]
*  It's gonna come back. It's gonna come roaring back. It's all gonna come going back. We're gonna put tariffs stop complaining [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=334.22s)]
*  We just realized that the place that we're supposed to be going to that really mean we just realized the place we're going to is actually [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=339.90000000000003s)]
*  hella far [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=345.90000000000003s)]
*  So in a panic moment, I had to like wake the entire crew up will still has not responded [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=347.5s)]
*  I don't even know if he is up so I have to call him real quick [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=353.44s)]
*  Okay [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=358.96s)]
*  But we we have to leave [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=360.55999999999995s)]
*  We have to leave earlier than I thought we were supposed to [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=364.0s)]
*  Okay, and his speech is not torture. That's your goddamn president talking. Okay. It's the Golden Age as Asim gold says [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=368.35999999999996s)]
*  It's more like the as minn golden age if you know what I'm saying [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=374.88s)]
*  but yeah, we're gonna do samurai training in a little bit so [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=379.59999999999997s)]

*  It's happening never before do you know the United States in? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=385.96s)]
*  1870 to 1913 all tariffs and that was the richest period in the history of the United States [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=390.28s)]
*  relatively speaking in other words relatively and [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=397.47999999999996s)]
*  We they set up the great tariff [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=400.64s)]
*  commission of [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=404.71999999999997s)]
*  1887 and [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=406.28s)]
*  This commission had one function [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=407.92s)]
*  What to do with all the money that we took is that they had no idea was a blue ribbon committee was set up [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=410.12s)]
*  1887 and what to do with all of the money that we had and again [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=416.8s)]
*  Teddy Roosevelt was a beneficiary because when McKinley was [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=422.44s)]
*  Killed he took over this vast sum of money and he did all of those national parks and all of the other things [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=426.64s)]
*  And I'm not knocking him but he was given a vast amount of money and that was all made through tariffs [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=433.48s)]
*  As we had no income tax the income tax came in in 1913 [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=439.16s)]
*  I like that he says like tariffs yield a tremendous bounty for America while simultaneously talking about Colombia and [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=442.64s)]
*  Justifying it use it justifying his usage on it with Colombia [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=450.92s)]
*  even though the Colombia situation had nothing to do with like American trade whatsoever and everything to do with political enforcement like [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=455.0s)]
*  He wanted to send in military. He wanted to send in Colombian nationals on [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=463.44s)]

*  military carriers in a way that is like very disrespectful and these guys who have previously [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=470.48s)]
*  Previously taken in Colombian nationals that have been deported from the United States of America. We're like no, we're not gonna do that [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=477.0s)]
*  We're gonna do this in a dignified way [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=481.64s)]
*  Not every single one of these people are like horrible criminals or whatever. You're disrespectful and Trump was like, yeah, I'm gonna do tariffs [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=483.76s)]

*  That's it. That's all he's doing but he's also trying to justify by being like it's gonna be tremendous economics [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=503.4s)]
*  Well, let me tell you what tremendous economics looks like. Okay [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=509.36s)]

*  It's through the roof. You know, we were having a lot of a lot of people weren't signing [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1248.8400000000001s)]
*  We were having a hard time recruiting people because they would look at these people that they were supposed to be their leaders [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1253.64s)]
*  They weren't happy. They didn't like people that [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1260.44s)]
*  Fall going upstairs if you're going to fall at least go downstairs from the plane that triple fall [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1263.24s)]
*  I use that thing in more ads [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1268.76s)]
*  I didn't I didn't have an ad where I didn't put that in just a little quick one, two three [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1270.8400000000001s)]
*  Reminded me of joe frazier when he went down right george foreman joe frazier three falls in a matter of seconds [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1275.56s)]
*  I said, can you speed it up a little bit people are getting tired of it [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1281.8s)]
*  But now they they we have now the best recruitment we've seen in a long time. There's a tremendous number of people [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1285.3200000000002s)]
*  Wanting to sign up january 20th 2025 was a turning point in american history [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1291.24s)]
*  starting last week [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1296.92s)]
*  We're ending years of incompetence [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1298.8400000000001s)]
*  radicalism and betrayal [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1302.1000000000001s)]
*  And we're ushering in the most exhilarating year of reform and renewal in the 250 year history of our country [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1303.88s)]
*  And just in conclusion, I just want to say that this has been a very exciting and will be a very exciting new chapter [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1311.0800000000002s)]
*  There's nothing we cannot achieve as long as the republican party remains united. I hope you can remain united [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1318.04s)]
*  And it's one thing I give the democrats a lot of credit for because you know, they have lousy policy [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1331.96s)]
*  I think frankly half of them are totally crazy [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1337.48s)]
*  But they do stick together. They stick together on stuff that nobody can I mean, how can you? [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1340.28s)]
*  Want prisons emptied out into our country they stick together they stick together on everything [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1345.48s)]
*  Impeachment hoax number one impeachment hoax number two. They stick together [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1351.3s)]
*  Although I must tell you you gave me great support during that [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1355.48s)]
*  those two [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1359.0s)]
*  Problems those two fake witch hunts which have now turned out to be totally fake and disgusting [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1360.92s)]
*  But you gave me tremendous support, but the republican party has to stick together [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1366.76s)]
*  We just can't have people going, you know, one two three votes [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1371.08s)]
*  And we don't have that luxury. I think this lie is ultimately an even bigger lie saying that the democratic party sticks together [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1374.92s)]
*  Isn't in my opinion a graver lie [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1382.84s)]
*  A far larger lie than saying that they're socialist. Okay, they do not stick together at all. What the hell [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1386.36s)]
*  I wish there I wish the democratic party operated in the way that the republicans imagine them. You know what I mean? [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1393.24s)]
*  It's so frustrating. Everything is so hard [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1398.28s)]
*  We always have two or three or five or something people that just don't want to do it [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1401.4s)]
*  And you just got to do it. You got one naysayer on his way out knowing full well [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1406.92s)]
*  You got one naysayer on his way out knowing full well that it wasn't going to undermine your agenda [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1412.68s)]
*  Making a symbolic move against pete hexit and you're over here complaining that you couldn't like win enough support within the republican party [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1418.8400000000001s)]
*  so many times and [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1426.3600000000001s)]
*  Like even with mike I called three or four people and they said okay, sir. I'll do it. I'm gonna vote [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1428.36s)]
*  I'm gonna vote positively and they're very happy they did now [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1433.3999999999999s)]
*  but [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1436.6s)]
*  When I called that we've gotten such a great response. We just had that happen. The democratic party has a [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1437.9599999999998s)]
*  a coalition of [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1444.12s)]
*  consistent spoilers the house has been that literally sometimes change party loyalty or [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1446.1s)]
*  Oftentimes will change party loyalty all but a name [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1452.1s)]
*  John federman can unify more than anybody would ever know [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1455.96s)]
*  And a victory is uh is sweeter as they say because of it [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1459.96s)]
*  And I think we're gonna have a lot of victories, but we have to stick together. We have to work together [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1463.48s)]
*  We have to fight together. We're gonna win together. We're gonna win like never before we have a chance to win [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1467.8s)]
*  Like never before as long as we stay united the 119th congress will be remembered as the most successful and accomplished republican majority [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1473.08s)]
*  In american history, I believe that I think we have a chance of doing that asan you're the only one still listening to the drooly boy [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1482.2800000000002s)]
*  The drooly boy and in january [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1488.6000000000001s)]
*  2027 [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1491.22s)]
*  We will have a larger republican house a larger republican senate and our country will be richer safer stronger prouder greater freer and [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1492.6000000000001s)]

*  I've raised a lot of money [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1512.04s)]
*  And uh, you know, I told my people we raised 1.7 billion. They raised 2.6 billion [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1513.88s)]

*  They cannot raise 10 cents [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZctXeCdTw8&t=1535.16s)]
