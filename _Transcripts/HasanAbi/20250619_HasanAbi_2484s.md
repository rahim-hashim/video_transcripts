**HasanAbi:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI)
*  You need a guy like Zoran. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=0.0s)]
*  You need a guy like Zoran. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=3.44s)]
*  You need a fighter and my God, are they doing everything they can now in the last round [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=7.12s)]
*  because he's become a real threat to the established order and the, the comfortable corruption [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=13.92s)]
*  that they want in business as usual politics that they're trying to as aggressively as [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=22.32s)]
*  possible. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  We're going to talk obviously about mom, Donnie. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=27.56s)]
*  We're going to begin. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=36.92s)]
*  I'm not closing in Cuomo's lead in New York city. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=37.92s)]
*  Mayor's race says new Maris poll. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=40.6s)]
*  However, the poll also shows like, I think, I think the poll also shows there is a big [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=43.0s)]
*  gap still. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=50.32s)]
*  It's a little concerning. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=53.14s)]
*  It makes me a little worried, but it's good to maintain optimism in this circumstance. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=54.980000000000004s)]
*  Let's take a look at the race for New York city mayor and Zoran mom. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=62.18s)]
*  Donnie is closing the gap with former governor Andrew Cuomo for the top spot six days before [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=67.06s)]
*  the primary. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=73.34s)]
*  I'm Donnie is now within 11 points of Cuomo in a new Maris poll, but with the first round, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=74.34s)]
*  That's the first round without rank choice. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=80.78s)]
*  Voting and no one with the majority of votes. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=85.54s)]
*  The race becomes a lot more complicated. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=88.62s)]
*  I wouldn't use reporter and Jay Burke. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=91.22s)]
*  It is live in lower Manhattan with our lead story tonight. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=92.62s)]
*  NJ right? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=95.7s)]
*  Liz outside a polling place here on Greenwich street in lower Manhattan. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=97.74000000000001s)]
*  You know, more than 130,000 people have voted in the election so far citywide. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=100.86s)]
*  And as you know, Andrew Cuomo has been the front runner from the moment he entered the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=107.14s)]
*  race. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=110.94s)]
*  But as you said, his numbers are flat and mom, Donnie has cut his lead in half. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=111.94s)]
*  The poll predicts that Andrew Cuomo will win, but he'll have to hold off a surging Zoran [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=121.14s)]
*  mom, Donnie. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=126.54s)]
*  We continue to be within 10 points. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=127.58s)]
*  We continue to be on the verge of a single digit race. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=130.58s)]
*  The 33 year old socialist assemblyman from Queens is closing the gap in a poll of likely [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=134.1s)]
*  democratic primary voters. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=139.66s)]
*  None of the candidates has the 50% needed to win outright. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=141.78s)]
*  Andrew Cuomo is first with 38%, followed by mom, Donnie with 27 and Comptroller Brad Lander [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=145.66s)]
*  and council speaker Adrian Adams, each with seven 11% are undecided. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=151.29999999999998s)]
*  The poll predicts that Cuomo beats mom, Donnie in the seventh round, 55% to 45%. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=157.68s)]
*  Lee Meringoff conducted the poll for the Marist Institute. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=164.8s)]
*  Cuomo is in front, but it's not a solid locked in kind of number for him. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=167.72s)]
*  Voters were also asked whether the city's next mayor should oppose President Trump. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=173.08s)]
*  72% said yes, 26% preferred compromising with the administration. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=177.88s)]
*  All of the democratic candidates are vowing to push back. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  Lander with his arrest. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=187.12s)]
*  What New York City needs right now is a mayor is a leader who will stand up and protect [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=189.04s)]
*  New Yorkers Cuomo with his TV ads. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=195.12s)]

*  run a race better than him. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=227.92s)]
*  I'm going to be honest with you. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=228.92s)]
*  Even if he wins, I don't know if the American public can be saved, but at least he's a beacon [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=230.52s)]
*  of hope. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=233.44s)]
*  Really necessary hope. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=235.84s)]
*  Like allow me to put my lip cap on for a brief moment and say that even if you are a liberal [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=237.12s)]
*  right now and you're scared of socialism, scared of like the scary brown guy, you can't [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=242.2s)]
*  deny that he is exactly the momentum that the Democratic Party needs. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=247.04s)]
*  A real fighter who is young, who is charismatic, who is going to actually routinely make a [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=252.28s)]
*  big fuss about Donald Trump. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=260.12s)]
*  He's going to do right by his constituents. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=261.6s)]
*  He's not going to be beholden to corporate interests. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=263.36s)]
*  This is exactly the type of guy you need. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=265.71999999999997s)]
*  It doesn't always have to be a white dude. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=267.32s)]
*  OK. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=269.32s)]
*  I know many liberals are so used to voting for the same names that they've seen over [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=270.32s)]
*  and over again, and they think that spells stability and stability is what we need right [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=274.8s)]
*  now. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=279.12s)]
*  But Zorak is the type of candidate that represents broad, popular ideas that you all want implemented. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=280.12s)]
*  And while he's young, OK, his lack of experience means that he is less corrupted by the very [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=290.4s)]
*  same forces that cause you to vote for these old douchebags who don't do anything for you [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=299.68s)]
*  and have calcified their support in their real corporate benefactors who only defend [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=306.8s)]
*  their real constituents, not you, not the average voter, but instead the real estate [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=313.16s)]
*  lobby and all these other special interest groups, whether it be DoorDash or numerous [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=319.08000000000004s)]
*  other expensive, numerous other expensive campaign contributors. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=323.20000000000005s)]
*  OK. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=329.04s)]
*  It's also obviously insane that there are New Yorkers out there who would rather vote [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=330.72s)]
*  for a cop. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=335.52000000000004s)]
*  OK. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=336.68s)]
*  Like Mr. Cop did a learn Mr. Cop Fondler, Andrew Cuomo, just because you know his last [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=338.64000000000004s)]
*  name, just you recognize his last name doesn't mean that like he is the right guy for this [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=344.56s)]
*  moment. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=348.6s)]
*  Every single aspect of New York City existence that has devolved in the last two decades [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=349.6s)]
*  is directly a consequence of Andrew Cuomo's leadership when he was the governor. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=360.28000000000003s)]
*  OK. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=368.28000000000003s)]
*  And now in an effort to continue that reign of corporate interest, people like Michael [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=369.28000000000003s)]
*  Bloomberg are pouring in millions of dollars. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=376.36s)]
*  Millions of dollars in the race. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=381.36s)]
*  Michael Bloomberg personally has dumped eight point five million dollars. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=382.36s)]
*  Andrew Cuomo gets support from a lot of these pig unions or at least the union leadership. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=392.56s)]
*  But the rank and file is not with Andrew Cuomo. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=397.2s)]
*  Because the rank and file understands that Andrew Cuomo is also anti-union. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=400.04s)]
*  He has already he has already destroyed New York politics and made New York Republicans [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=405.76s)]
*  significantly more powerful in the state so that he could maintain his grip of power. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=412.96s)]
*  He is exactly the kind of corrupt pervert that has ruined the lives of regular New Yorkers. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=421.28s)]
*  He is everything that's wrong with New York politics. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=427.09999999999997s)]
*  He's everything that's wrong with the Democratic Party. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=431.03999999999996s)]
*  His attitude is precisely the reason why you have tremendous resentment right now and this [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=435.16s)]
*  very moment towards the feckless ineptitude that you see from the Democrats. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=440.06s)]
*  You need a guy like Zoran. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=445.52000000000004s)]
*  You need a guy like Zoran. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=451.08000000000004s)]
*  You need a fighter. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=452.08000000000004s)]
*  And my God, are they doing everything they can now in the last round because he's become [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=454.66s)]
*  a real threat to the established order and the the comfortable corruption that they want [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=459.96s)]
*  in business as usual politics. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=468.23999999999995s)]
*  They're trying to as aggressively as possible. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=469.71999999999997s)]
*  And the process of doing that, they've opened up an unlimited money faucet and they're they're [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=473.15999999999997s)]
*  attacking him, claiming he is an anti-semite once again. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=484.9s)]
*  I said this yesterday, the concerted effort to spam the airwaves with anti-Semitism smears [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=490.44s)]
*  against Zoran is a desperate attempt to deprive New York City of the young dynamic fighter [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=494.08s)]
*  the Democrats desperately need all because he's anti genocide like the majority of the [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=497.24s)]
*  party's base. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=501.03999999999996s)]
*  Disgusting anti-Semitism smears are not effective in the United States of America, especially [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=502.03999999999996s)]
*  but they are. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=512.98s)]
*  And I would go so far as to say that it didn't even work with Corbyn. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=513.98s)]
*  But what it does do is gum up the works. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=517.5s)]
*  If you have a campaign and you want to show your in the in the last round here, okay, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=520.22s)]
*  right before the election, if you want to show your best foot forward, if you want to [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=526.5s)]
*  talk about your policies, if you're constantly battling anti-Semitism allegations, you're [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=530.66s)]
*  constantly on the back foot and you're it's a it's a time suck. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=535.14s)]
*  It's a waste of energy is a waste of media space and it will be the most like it'll be [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=539.74s)]
*  the thing that you're remembered by. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=546.8199999999999s)]
*  That is the way in which vicious smears. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=548.8199999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=552.8199999999999s)]
*  The way this started was when Zoran went on the bulwark show, which is run by rhinos. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=553.8199999999999s)]
*  It wasn't supposed to be like a heated debate or anything like that. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=561.02s)]
*  But Zoran went on bulwark with Tim Miller and Cameron Caskey friend of the show. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=564.92s)]
*  Cameron Caskey invited him. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=569.22s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=571.06s)]
*  On the show asked him about globalized the Intifada as a slogan and also from the river [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=573.06s)]
*  to the sea Palestine will be free as a slogan. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=578.5s)]
*  He said these are scary anti-Semitic slogans and [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=580.78s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=590.26s)]
*  Tim Miller is a rhino. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=591.26s)]
*  He's a never Trump Republican, whatever. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=592.8599999999999s)]
*  So his response to that was the exact same response that I've given to these statements. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=595.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=602.22s)]
*  He basically said something along the lines of he basically says something along the lines [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=604.1s)]
*  of Intifada is an Arabic word and that's what's scary about it. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=609.38s)]
*  Globalized the Intifada means globalized the revolution, globalized the struggle, globalized [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=614.7s)]
*  the rebellion. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=620.1800000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=621.1800000000001s)]
*  And it's it's. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=622.7399999999999s)]
*  It's the the Arabic or globalized the uprising. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=625.78s)]
*  It's the Arabic word for uprising. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=630.4599999999999s)]
*  That's just what it is. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=633.5799999999999s)]
*  And and that is the reason why that is the reason why the Holocaust Museum in the past [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=634.5s)]
*  when describing the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, when they translated to Arabic on their pages [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=643.8599999999999s)]
*  called it the Warsaw Ghetto Intifada. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=650.46s)]
*  Now of course the Holocaust Museum, which is so so so what I'm about to describe to you [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=653.46s)]
*  is so disgusting in general, but the Holocaust Museum doesn't just educate people on the [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=659.74s)]
*  Holocaust. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=665.5400000000001s)]
*  The Holocaust Museum's primary function now beyond educating people on the Holocaust and [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=666.5400000000001s)]
*  the depravity of mankind and the banality of evil and how we got here outside of that [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=672.5s)]
*  function. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=679.1s)]
*  The Holocaust Museum also serves a secondary, perhaps more important role right now, which [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=680.1s)]
*  is to defend Israel. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=684.98s)]
*  So the Holocaust Museum somewhere along the way, I believe in like twenty twenty four [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=686.94s)]
*  in the March in the month of March twenty twenty four after pressure from Zionist groups [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=692.14s)]
*  changed the interpretation. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=696.72s)]
*  The Arabic interpretation on their website used to say Warsaw Ghetto Intifada. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=699.62s)]
*  They changed it to a different name. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=704.34s)]
*  Ironically enough, the name that they changed it to is also a is now even more radical. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=707.18s)]
*  It's the name Hamas uses as well. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=714.42s)]
*  But most people don't know that. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=717.02s)]
*  OK most people are unfamiliar with that. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=720.4599999999999s)]
*  So they changed to a different Arabic name after pressure after they received pressure. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=723.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=726.9799999999999s)]
*  Mo Mo Kowama. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=727.9799999999999s)]
*  I'm not saying that correctly, but it means resistance, which is the M in Hamas. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=729.7199999999999s)]
*  OK. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=735.38s)]
*  Haraket al Muqawamma al Islamiya is the full name of Hamas. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=737.1s)]
*  Hamas is an acronym for those of you who don't know. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=742.02s)]
*  OK. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=745.34s)]
*  Haraket means movement al Muqawamma al Islamiya, which means the Islamic resistance movement. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=746.34s)]
*  Hamas is an acronym for people that don't know. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=751.7s)]
*  OK. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=754.38s)]
*  So ironically enough, the Holocaust Museum literally changed it to seemingly a more radical [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=755.38s)]
*  interpretation. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=761.82s)]
*  The real reason why they did it is because people are just scared of Arabic words, but [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=762.94s)]
*  it's so difficult to have this conversation. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=767.6600000000001s)]
*  It's so difficult to have this conversation with people because they too have this nascent [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=771.1s)]
*  Islamophobia and they don't want to address it and they don't want to talk about it. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=776.5400000000001s)]
*  They don't want to think about it. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=779.74s)]
*  So they'd rather behave like a racist person who just called out who was just called out [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=780.84s)]
*  for their racism. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=785.98s)]
*  Everyone here that is not white or has some form of marginalization has experienced this [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=787.62s)]
*  before. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=792.6999999999999s)]
*  When you call someone out for a form of bigotry that you have experienced, that person won't [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=793.6999999999999s)]
*  go, oh, my bad. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=802.42s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=803.62s)]
*  Let me, you know, let me check myself. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=805.18s)]
*  They'll turn around and double down and be like, you're the asshole for even, you know, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=808.14s)]
*  bringing this up. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=811.86s)]
*  You're the real villain for calling me racist, not me for being racist. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=812.86s)]
*  You're the villain for calling me a racist. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=816.6999999999999s)]
*  This is how Islamophobia works. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=820.02s)]
*  It's so prominent. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=822.6999999999999s)]
*  It's such a prominent fixture of modern American politics that like, you know, you can go on [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=823.6999999999999s)]
*  the view and have a bunch of dumb run around talking about how, you know, in Iran, women [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=828.26s)]
*  are not educated. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=838.1s)]
*  And after all of those pathetic smears that really went nowhere, a reporter asked Zoran [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=839.74s)]
*  why he doesn't respond more aggressively when someone calls him an anti-Semite. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=845.5799999999999s)]
*  That there's no room for anti-Semitism in this city, in this country. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=849.3399999999999s)]
*  And I've said that because that is something I personally believe. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=853.38s)]
*  And ultimately, to your question of why not a more visceral reaction, part of it has been [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=857.0999999999999s)]
*  colored by the fact that when I speak, especially when I speak with emotion, I am then characterized [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=862.38s)]
*  by those same rivals as being a monster, as being at the gates, language that describes [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=868.9399999999999s)]
*  as almost a barbarian looking to dismantle civilization. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=874.22s)]
*  And part of this is the very sad burden of what it means to be the first Muslim candidate [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=878.02s)]
*  to run for mayor, is to deal with dehumanizing language, to deal with a former governor who [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=883.38s)]
*  doesn't even view Muslims as being a part of this city sufficient that he would visit [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=890.74s)]
*  a mosque in more than 10 years. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=895.9s)]
*  And it pains me to be called an anti-Semite. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=897.98s)]
*  And it pains me to be painted as if I am somehow in opposition to the very Jewish New Yorkers [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=900.4599999999999s)]
*  that I know and love and that are such a key part of this city. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=905.78s)]
*  And yet I know that when I share that emotion, I continue to face a language as if I am a [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=909.2199999999999s)]
*  beast. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=916.4599999999999s)]
*  And it takes a toll to wake up in the morning and read messages that say things like... [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=917.4599999999999s)]
*  I get messages that say the only good Muslim is a dead Muslim. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=930.42s)]
*  I get threats on my life, on the people that I love. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=947.54s)]
*  And I try not to talk about it because the function of racism as Tony Morrison said is [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=957.82s)]
*  distraction. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=963.1s)]
*  My... [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=964.1s)]
*  Yeah, also, this is an experience shared by every Muslim person. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=965.1s)]
*  Okay? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=972.4200000000001s)]
*  I don't even visibly look Muslim and even I still experience it. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=973.86s)]
*  It's just every single person. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=978.5s)]
*  A lighter version of this is when people automatically assume that I'm biased against Israel because [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=980.1400000000001s)]
*  I have anti-Semitic tendencies borne out of being Muslim because this conflict is always [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=984.5799999999999s)]
*  described in the most idiotic terms in the United States of America, especially amongst [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=990.66s)]
*  morons as a religious conflict that has gone on for thousands of years when it has nothing [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=994.54s)]
*  to do with religion at all. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=999.98s)]
*  It's just... [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1001.3399999999999s)]
*  It's just every... even non-Muslims who are just brown have experienced a version of this. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1003.0999999999999s)]
*  It's just another form of bigotry. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1008.06s)]
*  Okay? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1010.3399999999999s)]
*  And just like anti-black racism, people get more mad when you even call it out. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1011.98s)]
*  So I think at this point, you know, 20 plus years after 9-11, most American Muslims, most [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1017.62s)]
*  Muslims in the West don't say anything about it because it's like, yeah, what are you going [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1023.62s)]
*  to do? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1026.98s)]
*  That's it. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1027.98s)]
*  What are you going to do? [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1028.98s)]
*  That's just how it is. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1029.98s)]
*  It is what it is. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1030.98s)]
*  That's just how it is. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1032.06s)]
*  You just have to navigate the space and eat it because if you spend a good deal of time [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1033.06s)]
*  trying to talk about this and trying to get people to reconsider their stands, it's just [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1041.02s)]
*  you create a wall. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1047.9799999999998s)]
*  They just don't want to hear you out and they would rather be left alone in the comfort [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1050.78s)]
*  of their bigotry and they won't listen to you on other issues. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1055.8999999999999s)]
*  That's how it is. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1060.9799999999998s)]
*  So it saddens me to see this. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1061.9799999999998s)]
*  It angers me to see this, but it's just how it is. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1064.4199999999998s)]
*  Consistently, consistently assuming that a Muslim person who has done a good deal of [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1068.9s)]

*  against anti-Semitism, as well as all other bigotries alike, consistently peppering them [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1082.5s)]
*  with accusations of anti-Semitism is Islamophobic. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1088.0600000000002s)]
*  Really? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1090.8200000000002s)]
*  Like it's ridiculous. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1091.8200000000002s)]
*  The idea that you're trying to find the secret anti-Semitism that exists in the heart of [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1093.7s)]
*  this person is ridiculous. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1099.38s)]
*  It sucks, but it also works incredibly well in Western society, especially amongst people [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1101.26s)]
*  who themselves are anti-Semitic, but can much easily distract away from their own personal [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1106.26s)]
*  actual anti-Semitic points of view by just being like, this is an Arab invention. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1112.18s)]
*  The highest form of this is the concept in Germany that anti-Semitism was imported into [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1117.8999999999999s)]
*  Germany by Arabs. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1126.8799999999999s)]
*  Dog, in recent history, your country did the Holocaust, man. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1128.58s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1133.5s)]
*  Arabs actually brought in anti-Semitism to Germany. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1135.1399999999999s)]
*  What a laughable, idiotic, cope-induced statement to make. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1138.02s)]
*  Huh. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1144.7s)]
*  The focus has always been on making this a city that's affordable, on making this a city [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1145.7s)]
*  that every New Yorker sees themselves in. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1151.18s)]
*  And it takes a toll, because this is a city that every single person deserves to be, and [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1154.18s)]
*  a city that we all belong to. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1162.18s)]
*  And the thing that's made me proudest in this campaign is that the strength of our movement [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1164.18s)]
*  is built on our ability to have built something across Jewish and Muslim New Yorkers, across [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1170.58s)]
*  New Yorkers of all faiths, and all backgrounds, and all boroughs. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1176.58s)]
*  And anti-Semitism is such a real issue in this city, and it has been hard to see it [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1179.58s)]
*  weaponized by candidates who do not seem to have any sincere interest in tackling it, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1188.58s)]
*  but rather in using it as a pretext to make local calls. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1195.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1199.62s)]
*  And of course, lo and behold, after these ridiculous attacks, and also Brad Lander says [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1200.62s)]
*  some shit too, he used this as an opportunity to shank Zoran too. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1208.3s)]
*  Only a couple days after, only a couple days after, they cross-endorse one another. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1212.78s)]
*  Brad Lander went on a spot on Pod Save America, and basically he was asked about the globalized [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1220.78s)]
*  Intifada thing. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1228.9s)]
*  And he responded with like, yeah, I was basically of like, I don't think Zoran is an anti-Semite. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1229.9s)]
*  Of course he's not. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1236.22s)]
*  But of course, when he uses that term, it's scary for people like myself, something along [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1237.6200000000001s)]
*  those lines. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1244.14s)]
*  I mean, we can watch the full clip if you want. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1245.14s)]
*  Brad Lander, to be fair, followed it up by saying he has full faith in Zoran. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1247.46s)]
*  I know Jacob Cornblue has the clip that was of course clip chimped. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1250.5s)]
*  And I know Brad Lander doesn't think Zoran Mamdani is an anti-Semite. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1257.4599999999998s)]
*  I know that. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1262.4599999999998s)]
*  Telling you here, Brad Lander, who cross-endores Mamdani, says Jacob. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1263.4599999999998s)]
*  You know, when I hear the phrase globalize the Intifada, I say to people, I'm telling [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1268.2199999999998s)]
*  you all I can hear right now is some Jews were killed in DC and there was a flamethrower [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1274.02s)]
*  in Boulder. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1279.82s)]
*  And maybe you don't mean to be saying it's open season on Jews everywhere in the world, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1281.34s)]
*  but that's what I hear. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1286.06s)]
*  And I'd like to hear that from other people as well. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1288.62s)]
*  At the same time, you know, though I am a strong believer in the vision of Israel as [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1291.86s)]
*  a Jewish and democratic state, I hate what the war, the Netanyahu government is conducting [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1297.1799999999998s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1302.52s)]
*  I have spoken up many times for a ceasefire for aid getting in there for an end to the [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1303.52s)]
*  occupation of the world. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1308.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1310.22s)]
*  Bizarre caption. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1311.22s)]
*  Lander has never agreed with Mamdani completely on Israel-Palestine. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1312.22s)]
*  Well, he criticized the one phrase he explicitly defends. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1315.06s)]
*  Mamdani is a candidate for all New York City years. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1316.86s)]
*  Defends his endorsement of Mamdani suggested Cuomo is the real bigot on the race. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1319.56s)]
*  West Bank and Gaza for the human rights of Palestinians. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1322.8999999999999s)]
*  And like, it's not the mayor of New York City's job. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1326.3s)]
*  Thank God to try to achieve safety and, you know, mutual self-determination between Israelis [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1328.86s)]
*  and Palestinians. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1334.02s)]
*  But it is the mayor's job to show up and say, we're going to bring. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1335.02s)]
*  Anyway, I thought about not even covering this because like it's so it's so stupid [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1339.8999999999999s)]
*  and giving it oxygen. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1346.3799999999999s)]
*  It's like further is the dynamic, further is the back and forth. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1347.3799999999999s)]
*  Brad Lander on why he ranks are on Mamdani second. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1353.18s)]
*  You saw him being attacked yesterday. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1356.5s)]
*  How do you feel about him being sort of labeled as an anti-Semitic and not sensitive to the [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1359.06s)]
*  feelings of Jewish New Yorkers? [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1365.3799999999999s)]
*  I mean, I've said this many times throughout the campaign and I'll say it again. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1366.38s)]
*  I mean, I am a proud Jewish New Yorker raising these beautiful Jewish kids in this city is [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1369.38s)]
*  one of the great joys of my life and nobody will fight harder to keep this. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1374.7800000000002s)]
*  I think Brad is, is a liberal Zionist. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1379.7800000000002s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1382.5s)]
*  At the end of the day, at the, at the end of the day, he is a Zionist still. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1383.5s)]
*  And I think he's a, he's a perfect demonstration of what I mean when I say like for a lot of [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1389.8200000000002s)]
*  these guys, it just bricks their brain. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1395.78s)]
*  Israel is this like final contradiction that they cannot resolve. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1398.02s)]
*  Do I think Brad is a nice person? [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1401.66s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1403.7s)]
*  I do. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1404.7s)]
*  I think he is and I believe he believes he's a nice person, but definitionally he is a [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1405.7s)]
*  nice person that either is diluted himself into thinking that this ethno state project [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1413.66s)]
*  is actually one that can be done while maintaining liberal values, which is ridiculous. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1419.38s)]
*  He just refuses to recognize it. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1425.5s)]
*  He just refuses to recognize the supremacist, fascist exterminationist ideology that is Zionism. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1427.82s)]
*  Okay. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1436.34s)]
*  Ultimately, ultimately, it's just, it's not really anything you can do. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1437.34s)]
*  There's no way to like resolve it. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1441.14s)]
*  For Jewish families and for all families, then I will. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1444.82s)]
*  I believe this has got a key function on City Hall, which is decency and integrity. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1449.94s)]
*  And Andrew Cuomo does not have decency and integrity and should not be allowed at City Hall. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1455.5s)]
*  I believe that Zoran Mamdani is a person of decency and integrity and I'm therefore encouraging [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1461.98s)]
*  people to rank him number two. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1468.22s)]
*  We do not agree on everything about Israel and Palestine, but I do believe that he will [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1471.3400000000001s)]
*  protect Jewish New Yorkers and our rights. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1477.26s)]
*  And I was proud to answer. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1479.98s)]
*  Sir. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1481.18s)]
*  Anyway, in the aftermath of all this that unfolded, of course. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1482.18s)]
*  Okay. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1486.14s)]
*  And for the record, if you want to know about why Trump names allies, the Holocaust Museum [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1487.14s)]
*  Board after firing, not that it matters to the Holocaust Museum actually changed the [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1490.78s)]
*  the Intifada to, I don't know how to, to, to the other Arabic word that is a part of [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1496.02s)]
*  the Hamas acronym, Mako. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1506.94s)]
*  Okay. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1509.1s)]
*  I don't speak Arabic for those of you who don't know. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1510.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1513.94s)]
*  They, they did that under the Biden administration. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1514.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1517.5s)]
*  They changed to a more radical term, ironically enough. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1518.5s)]
*  This seems to be in response to Zoran Mamdani saying the museum has used the word Intifada [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1522.18s)]
*  when discussing Warsaw ghetto uprising in Arabic per way back. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1525.9s)]
*  Looks like they use Intifada uprising on their site till mid 2024 when they switched up to [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1528.22s)]
*  Mukho Ma Mukho Mukho Ma Mukho Ma, which is wild because like I said, Hamas, the acronym [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1532.48s)]
*  and the M in Hamas is for Mukho Ma Mukho Ma Mukho Ma Mukho Ma Mukho Ma Mukho Ma Mukho [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1543.4s)]
*  Anyway, I'm okay. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1556.38s)]
*  Where am I? [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1557.38s)]
*  Why did Tim Miller even ask that to him? [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1558.38s)]
*  By the way, did he say that phrase at some point or you just want to stir the pot? [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1561.38s)]
*  I think he just wanted to stir the pot. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1563.9s)]
*  Zoran being peppered with questions about and sevens of Israel despite being ethnically [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1565.18s)]
*  Indian from Uganda, having no connection to any Muslim organization was racism. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1567.94s)]
*  It's no different than badgering a Jewish candidate about dual loyalty. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1571.0600000000002s)]
*  Anyway, a hedge fund manager who used to be the CIO of golden sacks and is allied with [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1573.98s)]
*  the number one funder of Andrew Cuomo super PAC. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1581.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1583.98s)]
*  Elijah Weisel, son of a now Holocaust survivor, Ellie Weisel. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1585.46s)]
*  I can't see into Zoran Mamdani soul when he doubles down on saying the globalizing the [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1589.5s)]
*  end of the fight is a good thing. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1593.22s)]
*  Blah, blah, blah. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1594.22s)]
*  Again, not a lot of motion, right? [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1595.22s)]
*  Not a lot of motion for this stuff. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=1599.02s)]

*  with why this race may not actually be over after Tuesday's primary. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2165.64s)]
*  Steve, I think it's got something to do with ranked choice voting and complicated ballots. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2170.14s)]
*  Walk us through it. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2174.14s)]
*  Yeah, and some very unusual laws in New York when it comes to elections. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2175.3799999999997s)]
*  But yeah, you would think overwhelmingly democratic city democratic primary next week, whoever [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2179.66s)]
*  wins that you might as well just call that person his honor or her honor. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2183.94s)]
*  Right? [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2188.7799999999997s)]
*  Well, not necessarily because will you mention it with memdani? [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2189.7799999999997s)]
*  He's one of the two front runners in the polling so far. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2193.2999999999997s)]
*  We'll see if that arrest today of Brad Lander does anything with his poll numbers, if anybody [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2195.98s)]
*  else makes some noise. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2200.1s)]
*  But all of the attention really lately has been on these two Cuomo memdani. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2201.46s)]
*  Now memdani for the reasons you just mentioned, the reasons that kept the New York Times, [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2205.14s)]
*  for instance, from endorsing him in this primary coming up, he's got some real political baggage [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2209.2s)]
*  is socialism far left views, inflammatory pronouncements he made there being featured. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2215.5s)]
*  Come on, man. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2220.46s)]

*  How the fuck? [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2223.5s)]

*  That's a weird seasoning that you added on to this. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2229.2599999999998s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2231.62s)]
*  Calm down, brother. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2232.62s)]
*  Messed up. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2233.62s)]
*  Heavily in attack ads right now. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2234.62s)]
*  If memdani were to win the Democratic nomination, there might be some discontent among Democrats. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2237.02s)]
*  And there certainly might be some vulnerability in a general election voters who wouldn't [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2243.18s)]
*  necessarily be sold on him, even if they would ordinarily vote Democratic. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2246.96s)]
*  On the other hand, Andrew Cuomo, who's been the front runner here, he resigned in that [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2250.44s)]
*  sexual harassment scandal as governor back in 2021. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2254.8599999999997s)]
*  He has been dogged by questions about his handling of COVID. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2258.02s)]
*  It's like, yeah, Zoram memdani. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2261.22s)]
*  He believes that Israel's an apartheid state doing a genocide, which is like what? [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2264.02s)]
*  80% of the position of the Democratic Party's base of support and also wants free buses [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2268.3s)]
*  and a rent freeze, which again are incredibly unpopular. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2273.98s)]
*  These are major weaknesses for Zoram memdani. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2277.6s)]
*  Andrew Cuomo on the other hand is a rapist. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2280.2599999999998s)]
*  I wonder if that's a weakness for him. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2282.38s)]
*  Free buses, rent freeze, and Israel should stop doing a genocide versus cop diddler. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2285.1000000000004s)]
*  Guy who diddled cops. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2292.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2293.78s)]
*  Cop rapists who may have killed your grandparents during COVID. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2294.78s)]
*  Really hard. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2299.5800000000004s)]
*  Really hard choice here. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2301.34s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2302.34s)]
*  Nursing homes in particular, when he was governor, there was a recent poll that found among Democrats [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2303.34s)]
*  more than 40% in New York City say they have a negative view of Cuomo. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2309.2200000000003s)]
*  He's got baggage. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2313.5s)]
*  He's got political liabilities that could plausibly carry over into a general election. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2314.66s)]
*  That's where the strange laws in New York come into effect when it comes to these elections. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2319.42s)]
*  It's basically this. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2323.62s)]
*  In New York, third parties can nominate candidates who are already major party nominees. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2324.62s)]
*  Let's play this out. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2331.5s)]
*  A couple potential scenarios here. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2333.18s)]
*  Let's say next week, these are the potential general election ballot lines, parties that [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2336.22s)]
*  these candidates could have. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2341.38s)]
*  Let's say that Andrew Cuomo were to lose the Democratic primary to Zoran Mamdani. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2342.8999999999996s)]
*  So Zoran Mamdani would then be the Democratic candidate. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2347.9399999999996s)]
*  Cuomo couldn't run as a Democratic candidate. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2351.7s)]
*  In most states, he'd be eliminated. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2353.5s)]
*  The race would be over. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2354.7799999999997s)]
*  But Cuomo is also going to be the nominee of a party he created called the Fight and [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2355.7799999999997s)]
*  Deliver Party. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2360.9399999999996s)]
*  So even if he loses the primary and Mamdani is the Democratic candidate, Cuomo can still [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2362.06s)]
*  run in November as the Fight and Deliver candidate. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2367.52s)]
*  For that matter, if Cuomo were to win the primary and Mamdani were to lose it, there's [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2370.66s)]
*  a party called the Working Families Party that's already said a Democrat should vote [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2376.2599999999998s)]
*  for Mamdani in this primary that may well endorse him if he wants to run as their candidate. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2380.94s)]
*  So he could. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2385.24s)]
*  My favorite one is Eric Adams, who's running on the end anti-Semitism party, which is hilarious [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2386.24s)]
*  Eric Adams last week did a fucking did a kick stream with a Holocaust denier. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2394.1s)]
*  And also what's her face? [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2403.7s)]
*  What's the lady's name? [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2406.04s)]
*  The bald one. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2407.5s)]
*  I'm forgetting now. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2409.5s)]
*  My brain is so busted. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2410.5s)]
*  Sneak Oh is the per Amber Rose, Amber Rose and Sneak Oh. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2412.18s)]
*  Yes, you heard that right. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2414.74s)]
*  Sneak Oh and Amber Rose. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2416.2999999999997s)]
*  Take another shot at in the general election. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2418.7s)]
*  There's going to be a Republican nominee Curtis Lee. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2421.14s)]
*  What the he's not running in the Democratic primary, but he's created his own parties. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2423.58s)]
*  He's running in the general election. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2428.74s)]
*  There's an independent too. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2430.12s)]
*  So really if this is close, I mean it's over the New York. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2431.46s)]
*  The New York mayoral primary is the race. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2435.12s)]
*  The general election is ridiculous. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2438.22s)]
*  Look at the fucking general. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2440.1s)]
*  Like this is New York City. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2441.1s)]
*  We're talking about. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2442.54s)]
*  That's why the primary is the is the actual real race. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2443.8599999999997s)]
*  Unless mom, Donnie gets somehow rat fucked out of winning. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2448.14s)]
*  I'm Donnie turn around and try again in the general election. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2453.14s)]
*  If they want to Garrett, they've both got vehicles to do so. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2456.2599999999998s)]
*  I'm dizzy now, Steve. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2460.98s)]
*  Thank you so much for that. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2463.02s)]
*  And I look at yeah, Cuomo will definitely run if he's still losing the dim primary. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2464.02s)]
*  But do you think mom, Donnie would run with the working families party? [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2468.3399999999997s)]
*  He should. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2470.5s)]
*  He absolutely, absolutely should. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2471.5s)]
*  And I think he will, but I don't even want to entertain that notion rat fucked. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2473.66s)]
*  I mean, yeah. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awgRw2xgNI&t=2478.06s)]
