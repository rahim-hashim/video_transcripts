# Israel Is Not HIDING It Anymore | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [May 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY)
*  like the bits and pieces I've seen of it. Having said that, my assessment, my assessment is always [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=0.0s)]
*  that the allowance given to Israel to be able to operate like this still ultimately comes back to [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=10.24s)]
*  Western interest. Okay. I feel like people that overestimate Israel's power and influence end up [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=18.16s)]
*  accidentally underestimating America. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=26.639999999999997s)]
*  Let's continue. Israeli kills, dozens sheltering in Gaza school officials say. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=34.48s)]
*  Welcome back. Let's return to our Palestinian have been killed into separate Israeli overnight, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=39.6s)]
*  including us on a school that was sheltering displaced families. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=44.72s)]
*  The twin attacks are part of a broader Israeli offensive in the north of the territory that has [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=48.16s)]
*  escalated over the past week. Amid growing international pressure on the Israelis to [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=52.08s)]
*  allow more aid into Gaza. Israel does not allow international media organizations, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=56.72s)]
*  including the BBC to report from Gaza, from Jerusalem. Here's Yulanda. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=61.2s)]
*  Israeli kills, dozens sheltering in Gaza school is very different as far as headlines goes from [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=72.88s)]
*  the BBC name dropping. Israel is huge. That is something that has not happened before, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=81.76s)]
*  by the way, I'm not going to show you this video because you can clearly see a little girl [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=89.84s)]
*  on fire in this video. Okay. The fact that they're even showcasing that on BBC is crazy. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=95.44s)]
*  The fact that they're showing that this is a like openly stating that this is a, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=102.88000000000001s)]
*  Oh, she's, oh, I thought she said she didn't survive. I thought the girl on the video didn't [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=107.11999999999999s)]
*  specifically survive. But again, not she they're not talking about they're not saying they are not [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=113.44s)]
*  saying that this was a force of nature. They're not saying that this was a force of nature. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  They're openly saying it was Israel. They're not saying Palestinians died. They're saying Israel [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=126.8s)]
*  killed them. All this stuff is different from their coverage in the past. Okay. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=131.84s)]
*  They're not saying that they're not saying Hamas backed, uh, Gaza and health ministry. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=140.48s)]
*  Like these were all the different ways and very meaningful ways where the media, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=147.6s)]
*  mainstream media specifically, uh, manufacturers consent and, and normalizes this kind of, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=152.95999999999998s)]
*  or at least like shelters, uh, Israel from, uh, from being responsible for this kind of, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=160.56s)]
*  because a lot of people don't have the capacity to pay attention to every single thing that's [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=167.2s)]
*  going on, you know? So they just like read the headlines and they move on. And if the headlines [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=172.72s)]
*  are not actually saying Israel did this, then ultimately they don't think maybe Israel is [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=177.52s)]
*  responsible for this. Right. Is the full standing army, the IOF being deployed new since no Western [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  outlet seems to have reported on this specifically? Uh, yeah, we'll, we'll get to that in a second. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=190.88s)]
*  A world of a Shech Halil made out alive, but her mother and two older siblings did not. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=197.68s)]
*  A classroom turned shelter turned inferno overnight. Israel's military says it attacked [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=205.76s)]
*  what it called key terrorists here in Gaza city and took steps to. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=213.36s)]
*  Why do you think they're doing it now? What has changed? I think that people think that your [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=218.0s)]
*  voices don't matter. People think that your protests don't matter and it's understandable [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=223.84s)]
*  to succumb to nihilism. Okay. Especially after 19 months of unlimited and but it does matter [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=229.60000000000002s)]
*  because all of that pressure eventually, eventually will cause the dam to break. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=239.28s)]
*  And we are approaching that at a rapid clip right now. The dam is breaking. The dam is breaking [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=247.04s)]
*  where the, the consistent protests have finally caused the Western leadership to take a different [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=255.04s)]
*  position. And when they take like a more aggressive position against Israel, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=264.8s)]
*  that causes these mainstream outlets in the Western world that gives them a permission to also start [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=269.76s)]
*  accurately covering the events that are unfolding. A similar thing happened. A microcosm of this [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=277.6s)]
*  example I'm giving you is exactly what happened with Kilmar Abrego Garcia's story. When Senator [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=284.48s)]
*  Chris Van Hollen went down to El Salvador and the media started covering it, all of a sudden, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=290.32s)]
*  the attitude swung in the direction of negativity for Donald Trump's immigration enforcement [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=295.76s)]
*  agenda. It was his most popular agenda up until that moment. But now that the media had started [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=304.4s)]
*  covering it honestly, truthfully, focusing on it, all of a sudden people were getting resentful [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=309.68s)]
*  about what Trump was doing. And that is precisely what's going on in Europe as well. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=315.44s)]
*  Alonzo Ghermendi is absolutely correct. Okay. With this assessment, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=320.88s)]
*  I'm going to read it to you. And that is my, this is my assessment as well. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=333.76s)]
*  I disagree that Europe turning on Israel has anything to do with shock of their cruelty. Two [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=337.03999999999996s)]
*  things simply have conflated at the same time. One, leaders hope that Gaza would fade into the [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=340.71999999999997s)]
*  background and people would forget, but they never did, which increased its political cost. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=345.03999999999996s)]
*  Trump betrayed Europe, which meant European leaders needed to find a way to signal both A, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=350.48s)]
*  their disapproval of the new US and B, their security and foreign policy independence and [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=354.8s)]
*  self-sufficiency. Turning the heat on Israel was the easiest way to do this. This is in fact, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=359.84s)]
*  exactly what Lula did in 2010 to signal his intent to distance South America from the US. Brazil got [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=365.28s)]
*  the entire region to recognize Palestine and it worked. Things were never the same. The key [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=370.8s)]
*  thing to watch is the upcoming high-level conference on the two-state solution, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=376.64s)]
*  which is the venue where the anti-MAGA West will make its move to distance from US leadership by [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=380.71999999999997s)]
*  having key states recognize Palestine. I really do not think Macron, Starmer, et cetera, simply [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=385.76s)]
*  got too sad about Palestinians. They could not care less about them. They are simply trying to [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=391.28s)]
*  kill two birds with one stone, appease an angry electorate and distance diplomatically and [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=396.0s)]
*  strategically from the US. What they are ironically doing, what they are ironically doing is what I [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=400.56s)]
*  was demanding Kamala Harris do and aesthetically distance herself from Joe Biden by using this key [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=406.08s)]
*  issue. Even from a cynical position, even from a cold-hearted sociopathic calculation for [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=413.03999999999996s)]
*  Kamala Harris, this is exactly what I was demanding from the campaign. Even if you do not care about [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=419.84s)]
*  the Palestinians, you should still come out and make a statement that distances yourself from the [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=425.59999999999997s)]
*  incredibly unpopular Biden administration if you want to win the election. That is precisely what [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=431.59999999999997s)]
*  these European leaders are doing. But here is the thing. Many of you will say, oh, well, this is, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=437.12s)]
*  in effect, hundreds of thousands of people have died so far. They have been murdered by Israel. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=442.32s)]
*  It is a j*****. It is not going to put an end to it. I always will tell you these things take time. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=447.2s)]
*  They take time. It is not going to happen overnight. This is directionally in the right [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=454.08s)]
*  direction. This is directionally a good thing that leadership in these countries move in the [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=460.88s)]
*  direction of Palestinian emancipation. And that is a good thing, even if it is just for pure aesthetics. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=467.44s)]
*  Why is that a good thing? Why is that a good thing? Because even if it is just for pure aesthetics, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=474.24s)]
*  like I said, it gives media, state media like the BBC or media in the Western world, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=479.84s)]
*  more permission to cover what Israel is doing by directly blaming Israel for the [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=486.96s)]
*  instead of trying to actively contextualize said violence and defend Israel's violence against the [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=493.28s)]
*  Palestinians. That narrative shift is very important for your parents, for your grandparents, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=499.12s)]
*  and the people who do rely on understanding the world by just simply looking at whatever the f***** [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=505.59999999999997s)]
*  mainstream narratives are. Because eventually it gets to a point where every single person [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=510.96s)]
*  has basically encountered, even if it's just for a brief moment, the truth about what Israel is [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=517.84s)]
*  doing, the truth about Israel's cruelty. And that is a never-ending cycle because that creates even [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=523.36s)]
*  more public pressure. That means even more people will go out and protest in the streets. So then [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=531.52s)]
*  it gets to a point where Western leadership that have championed themselves as like the saviors of [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=537.92s)]
*  liberal democracy will have to either continue to maintain apathy, continue to demonstrate apathy, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=544.72s)]
*  sorry, and act like they don't care and that the democratic process is not real at all and it's [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=554.64s)]
*  completely a falsehood that they've presented and they're not even seeking to defend this process [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=560.56s)]
*  or the international rule-based order or whatever. They're just completely done with that. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=567.8399999999999s)]
*  Cast aside any notion of democracy in the West, either they will play the role of [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=572.0s)]
*  servile client states that don't care about their own individual population's discontent [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=582.7199999999999s)]
*  with their allegiance to Israel or they have to make changes. They have to genuinely make [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=589.44s)]
*  changes and maybe even apply sanctions to the state of Israel and apply pressure to the state [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=595.7600000000001s)]
*  of Israel in an effort to appease the crowds that are angry. That's it. That's it. That's where we're [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=600.1600000000001s)]
*  at. Anyway, let's continue. To stop civilians getting hurt but children were killed. It was [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=608.48s)]
*  horrific, says one displaced mother pulled from the rubble with her son. It was indescribable. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=616.64s)]
*  Body parts, charred bodies, the smell of burning. I swear to God our hearts have died. We're shaken. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=624.3199999999999s)]
*  We're exhausted. Enough. Those killed in their sleep were carried to their final resting places [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=631.68s)]
*  today and the number of dead continued to rise. 17 members of one family reportedly killed in an [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=639.36s)]
*  Israeli s**t in the north. As Israel's military steps up its offensive, the chief of staff says [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=647.44s)]
*  Hamas is under immense pressure. Israel plans to seize all of Gaza. A big supporter of that is its [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=654.8000000000001s)]
*  hardline minister, Itamar Ben-Gavir, marking Israel's Jerusalem day with a provocative visit [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=664.96s)]
*  to the city's most contested holy site. We held a prayer here for the well-being of the hostages [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=671.2800000000001s)]
*  that they all return home safely and for victory in the war. There's mass hunger. I think when this [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=678.5600000000001s)]
*  happens by the way, I think when this happens, like when enough pressure comes from western public, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=685.6800000000001s)]
*  which is we're there already, and then the western leadership, not America but like at least the [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=695.2s)]
*  other countries in Europe and whatnot, start using this as an issue to say we are not on board with [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=703.6s)]
*  this, to appease the crowds that are understandably resentful and also to decouple from America and [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=710.0s)]
*  American influence, even if it's an aesthetic choice, even if it's simply just like a symbolic [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=716.88s)]
*  choice. Eventually, eventually, Israel will sever, Israel will basically discard Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=722.88s)]
*  because at that point he will have outlived his usefulness for American interests in the region. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=734.56s)]
*  And I suspect that they will try to actively present a liberal Zionist future for Israel, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=740.56s)]
*  despite the fact that there is no real coalition for that as it stands. Because from what we have [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=747.92s)]
*  seen in public policy polls, in public polls, affinity polls that come out of Israel, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=754.4s)]
*  the societal understanding of the Gaza problem or the Palestinian problem is virtually identical to [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=762.24s)]
*  Nazi Germany at this point and their analysis of the quote unquote Jewish problem. So I think [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=771.8399999999999s)]
*  they will try to present this like in the future, they will eventually, when all is said and done, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=779.68s)]
*  when the dust is settled, they will say such a violent guy, Itamar Ben-Gurvier, he's such a [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=785.76s)]
*  violent radical guy. Look, we have these, you know, this new wave, this new coalition of like [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=789.44s)]
*  liberal Zionists, if they can even reach a significant enough, even if they can reach a [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=795.5200000000001s)]
*  significant enough number to build a coalition, okay, to build a governing coalition in Israel, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=805.2s)]
*  which I don't even think that's possible. Eventually, they'll try to massage it in the [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=813.92s)]
*  Western world with like liberal Zionist framework to make it seem like Israel was trying to, Israel [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=822.4799999999999s)]
*  is always just trying to do its best, but it's just like surrounded by enemies, all this stuff. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=827.68s)]
*  Here is Mer-Sheimer saying something similar as well here. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=832.0799999999999s)]
*  It's not just these particular leaders who support this policy inside of Israel. You don't see [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=837.04s)]
*  hardly any protests among the Israeli public regarding this genocidal policy. It's truly [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=845.68s)]
*  shocking. And when you look at what the Western elites are doing, they're hardly doing anything [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=854.4s)]
*  to prevent it. It's just truly amazing. It's sickening. I don't know what else to say. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=860.56s)]
*  I didn't think anything like this would ever happen, but it is happening. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=866.3199999999999s)]
*  All right, to turn your stomach a little bit, this is a former member of the Knesset and [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=870.64s)]
*  former member of Prime Minister Netanyahu's party, Chris Cutt, number 10. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=874.88s)]
*  Every child in Gaza is the enemy. We are at war with the Ghazan entity, the Ghazan terror entity, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=879.1999999999999s)]
*  which we ourselves established in Gaza, in Oslo, and in the disengagement. The disengagement that [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=885.2s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu voted in favor of, that is the enemy now. Every such child to whom you are [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=891.52s)]
*  now giving milk in another 15 years will rape your daughters and slaughter your children. We need to [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=897.68s)]
*  conquer Gaza and settle it. And not a single Ghazan child should remain there. Let's stop telling [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=902.72s)]
*  ourselves this deception, just to score points in this game between pro-Bibi and anti-Bibi. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=909.36s)]
*  This isn't about left or right, it's about winning this war, and it's about justice. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=915.12s)]
*  When will we learn? When will we learn? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=920.08s)]
*  You're saying that this attitude is prevalent amongst the Israeli public. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=923.2s)]
*  I think that that's exactly right. I don't see any evidence that there's an uprising in the Israeli [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=928.24s)]
*  public against the genocide. There are lots of protests in Israel, but those protests have to [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=934.48s)]
*  deal with the hostages and relations between the IDF and the government. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=941.2s)]
*  It's crazy that a famous international relations scholar has been blackballed and reduced to doing [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=948.48s)]
*  the third rate podcast circuit all because he's critical of Israel. I wouldn't say that. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=953.2s)]
*  And also his time will come. Mer-Shymer has had a lot of pressy intakes, both as it relates to Russia [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=958.4000000000001s)]
*  and Ukraine in the lead up to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. And he's also, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=968.5600000000001s)]
*  I mean, he's not like a leftist by any means chatters, please make no mistake. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=978.08s)]
*  But he's also obviously incredibly on the money when it comes to Israel. He has a fantastic [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=983.6s)]
*  understanding of this dynamic here. I would go so far say that I feel like sometimes that he [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=992.88s)]
*  overestimates, I guess, the Israeli lobby. But even then, I think it's incredibly, I mean, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1003.04s)]
*  his analysis is sober and very critical and necessary. But you will see people like him [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1012.16s)]
*  get more play in mainstream resources fairly soon. I mean, he still does like, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1021.36s)]
*  he still does the speaking circuit. It's not like he's not invited. He still goes and speaks [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1029.3600000000001s)]
*  at college campuses, things like that. He has Jeffrey Sachs as well. Jeffrey Sachs is another [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1039.76s)]
*  person who does this kind of thing. I'm writing an article on the denazification. This is exactly [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1045.68s)]
*  what happened with Germany after World War II. Hitler and his inner circle were scrutinized, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1052.24s)]
*  but the ideological base of Nazism was never fully discarded. Sure, the violence was criticized with [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1054.96s)]
*  the core of their hatred and reactionary thinking was allowed to fester. Yes. And then it was also [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1058.72s)]
*  weaponized by America because it served the interests of America, which was to eradicate [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1063.1200000000001s)]
*  any sort of like communist allegiance or communist sympathy in all of these countries. Anyway, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1070.24s)]
*  let's continue. But they don't have to do with stopping the genocide. I mean, you want to file [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1076.24s)]
*  all of this under the Nazification of Israel. That's where it should be filed. This is a country [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1081.2s)]
*  that's gone completely off the rails. And you know, he wrote the book Israel Lobby. No, that's why I [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1087.1200000000001s)]
*  said I'm pretty sure he understands the leverage they have. I think it's important. I know, chat. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1091.84s)]
*  Thank you. I mean, look, I think that the lobby in and of itself plays a tremendously important [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1098.64s)]
*  role. But and the book is great, at least like the bits and pieces I've seen of it. Having said that, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1107.3600000000001s)]
*  my assessment, my assessment is always that the allowance given to Israel to be able to operate [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1116.8000000000002s)]
*  like this still ultimately comes back to Western interest. Okay. I feel like people that overestimate [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1127.44s)]
*  Israel's power and influence end up accidentally underestimating America's interest in Israel [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1135.68s)]
*  behaving this way. The allowance that America gives to Israel to basically fucking do USS Liberty, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1142.64s)]
*  right? Or the allowance that America gives to Israel to have guys like Jonathan Pollard, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1149.44s)]
*  you know, steal information and send it to Israel, and then even releasing Jonathan Pollard. Like, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1154.8s)]
*  all of this stuff is completely done under the watchful gaze of our intelligence community. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1160.6399999999999s)]
*  And sure, there's a lot of back and forth there. There's some in the CIA that despise Israel and [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1167.6s)]
*  some in the CIA that love Israel, right? But the point is, if it was not such a profoundly important [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1173.04s)]
*  part of America's grand design for the region, at least by their estimation, they would not let it [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1181.1200000000001s)]
*  happen. It's that simple. That's it. Do you see what I mean? And I think a lot of people [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1187.76s)]
*  basically abdicate the responsibility of America. They like shelter America's responsibility in this [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1194.3200000000002s)]
*  process. Whenever they lean too much on the side of like, well, Israel is like hypnotized Americans [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1201.68s)]
*  or something. You know, that's not the case. Like, or people that will or people that will say stuff [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1208.96s)]
*  like, what do you call it? People that say something like, Oh, there's like a massage operations. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1216.64s)]
*  That's the reason why my, my big, beautiful Republican American congressperson is so pro [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1222.72s)]
*  Israel because he's blackmailed. You know, why do you bring bright lights in your clubs? What the [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1228.8s)]
*  fuck does that mean? Can you name a relationship in history similar to Israel and America relations? [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1234.96s)]
*  No, I cannot. There is no comparison. The reason why there is no, the reason why there is no [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1239.2800000000002s)]
*  comparison is because like it's obvious that as a favored client state, Israel is, is significantly, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1246.0s)]
*  significantly more influential and significantly more powerful than any other favored nation that [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1253.6000000000001s)]
*  is, that is under the banner of American empire. Okay. A good comparison is Turkey and Azerbaijan. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1260.4s)]
*  No, no, it's not a good comparison because Turkey doesn't get to do whatever the fuck it wants. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1266.72s)]
*  Turkey is, is, is still also endlessly controllable and Turkey can't do half of the shit that Israel [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1272.8000000000002s)]
*  does. The greatest example between Turkey would be, Oh, you mean between Turkey and Azerbaijan. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1279.44s)]
*  I thought you meant like Turkey for America. Turkey gets to do Israel shit. I thought you were, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1285.6s)]
*  is your head smaller than average from inbreeding? That's what happened. It's very funny to say [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1291.28s)]
*  that I might've been inbred as a white nationalist who is advancing racial purity politics. Who do [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1298.32s)]
*  you think is more inbred? Me or the average fucking Nazi who thinks that they must maintain the purity [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1307.12s)]
*  of the white race. There are examples anyway, there are examples of like other countries that have [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1313.52s)]
*  vassal states like this, but the, the relationship between Israel and America is, is, is, is so [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1327.92s)]
*  difficult to, it's difficult to make accurate comparisons. I don't know. Anyway, let's continue. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1335.28s)]
*  See it in operation. The more it looks like the Germans under Hitler, this is just hard to believe. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1346.16s)]
*  We're talking about eradicating all of the Palestinians in Gaza, murdering them. This is [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1352.64s)]
*  hard to believe. This is the sort of things that Germans did. It's supposed to be never again. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1359.52s)]
*  I don't see any evidence that people in Israel believe in the principle of never again, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1365.76s)]
*  certainly when it applies to the Palestinians and people in the West are hardly lifting a finger. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1372.8s)]
*  This is a categorically reprehensible. Yeah. So the reason, what? Hi, how long will you be suspended [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1378.08s)]
*  from Twitch? I want to know when I can watch you here again. What do you mean? I'm, I'm unsuspended [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1385.2s)]
*  already. I don't think there is a comparison between America and Israel with any other country on the [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1389.28s)]
*  planet because like someone was saying like, well, China uses Pakistan, but I feel like if Pakistan [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1395.8400000000001s)]
*  was doing espionage against China, China would not allow that to continue. Or if Pakistan, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1401.68s)]
*  I don't know, killed like an entire, like I killed a bunch of like Chinese [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1409.6s)]
*  air force pilots or something. China would not allow that relationship to continue in the same [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1416.6399999999999s)]
*  way. That dynamic would be ruined in an irreparable manner. That's why I'm saying there is nothing. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1422.4s)]
*  Like you say Russia and Belarus. Okay. Can Belarus kill Russian troops and, and get away with it? No. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1430.24s)]
*  Also, you have to understand at most, at most you have to recognize that at most the, the regional [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1437.36s)]
*  leaders that we are talking about are not even engaging in, in imperialism in the way that [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1444.6399999999999s)]
*  the Western world is, is engaging in imperialism. At most they're doing irredentist actions, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1451.28s)]
*  which would still be obviously consequential, inappropriate, wrong, right? Morally incorrect, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1457.04s)]
*  but irredentism and imperialism have significant differences. Like look at, and the most basic [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1465.1200000000001s)]
*  function of imperialism is like in the most reductive ways. If you look at this, it's like, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1472.72s)]
*  look at where America is, look at where the fuck Israel is. Okay. As opposed to like China and [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1477.84s)]
*  Pakistan and the relationship that they have is, or Russia and Belarus and the relationship that [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1483.92s)]
*  they have is, is, is not comparable to Israel and America because America wants to have a foothold [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1488.72s)]
*  in a region that they are very, very far away from. Okay. That's why it's so unique. Why skip [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1496.72s)]
*  Merzheimer? I'm not. His clip ended. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1504.56s)]
*  It's head has now resigned saying the idea doesn't stick to humanitarian principles. Today, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1518.72s)]
*  young world returned to the ruins of the bomb shelter in Gaza. Guys, this kind of stuff is [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1525.1200000000001s)]
*  silly. Okay. No disrespect to Brett, but like, obviously the reason why this manifesto triggered [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1530.56s)]
*  a band and previous ones didn't is because there's a lot of extra attention and, and there's a lot [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1537.52s)]
*  of people that want to fucking get me banned right now. Okay. It's that simple. Like no one, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1545.12s)]
*  you can't make this argument. I'm sorry. No one believes, no one believes this argument. Okay. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1550.6399999999999s)]
*  I don't think Brett fucking believes this argument. According to his application to [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1555.36s)]

*  saying. And I think what you're saying is correct, but a lot of this stuff is just off of feelings. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1566.2399999999998s)]
*  Okay. That's it. It's not like it doesn't, you know, it doesn't work that way. It's, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1574.0s)]
*  it's never, you know, of course I don't just pointing out the hypocrisy. I know, but most [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1581.04s)]
*  people don't even see it as such. Most people don't even see it as like, as anything, but like, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1584.88s)]
*  it's just the way that we understand it. You don't have to defend Twitch, man. I'm not actually, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1590.4s)]
*  I think that this ban or this suspension was, was really stupid and they should stop. They should [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1595.76s)]
*  stop trying to apply terms of service on this issue or at the very least like, look, I'm on a [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1603.28s)]

*  drugs and sensitive social issues. If you have created a specific content classification label, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1615.84s)]
*  you should have a specific terms of service for that content classification label that is similar [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1621.68s)]
*  to what YouTube does. YouTube, right? I mean, yeah, there's drugs, intoxication and excessive [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1627.44s)]
*  tobacco use. And then, you know, mature rated game gambling, significant profanity or vulgarity, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1632.72s)]
*  sexual themes, violent graphic depictions. Like these are all the different content classification [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1639.04s)]
*  labels, right? And they created one specifically for politics and sensitive social issues. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1643.6000000000001s)]
*  Okay. If you have a specific label for this that I have to, that I have to be in, okay, [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1649.28s)]
*  a label that actually diminishes my reach on the platform, a label that, a label that I am, [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1657.6s)]
*  you know, voluntarily clicking on and staying on a label that actually causes me to not run any ads, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1666.3999999999999s)]
*  which I enjoy. I like that. I don't have an issue with that anyway. You know, then that label, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1672.56s)]
*  as long as they're on that label, you should get, you should, you should have additional allowances [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1680.0s)]
*  like YouTube even, like YouTube has. For example, for fair use on YouTube, news and information is [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1686.48s)]
*  pretty significant. There is, you have more allowances even on the YouTube platform when [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1696.88s)]
*  you're live streaming or when you're making content in terms of fair use, because news and [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1704.56s)]
*  commentary, news and information is seen as a totally separate category, just like education [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1710.16s)]
*  on YouTube has a totally separate category. And that's why like you can do sexual education on [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1716.64s)]
*  YouTube and literally show like, you know, dicks and vaginas and titties and whatnot. If you were [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1721.76s)]
*  to do like an education classified sexual education video, right? My point is there are, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1728.24s)]
*  there are different subcategories as well. And if that's the case, then there should be [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1737.52s)]
*  additional allowances when you're in that sensitive subject category. Okay. That's it. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1744.7199999999998s)]
*  City as yet unaware of her personal loss amid growing international criticism over the suffering [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1750.6399999999999s)]
*  caused by this war, her trauma will only deepen. And we can draw now join your land live in [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1757.28s)]
*  Jerusalem. Let's focus a bit firstly, then your land on aid, the Gaza humanitarian foundation. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1764.56s)]
*  It's controversial. It's backed by the U S and by Israel, but it's so complicated getting aid in. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1771.76s)]
*  And they say they've started to begin their work there. How much do we know about what they're [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1779.6799999999998s)]
*  doing and how they're going to move around, how they plan to distribute aid? Well, first of all, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1784.3999999999999s)]
*  remember that aid is still in dangerously short supply across the entire Gaza strip, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1788.4s)]
*  despite the fact that Israel did begin to ease slightly. It's total blockade that has gone on [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1794.3200000000002s)]
*  for 11 weeks. Just one week ago. Now we had a statement from this newly created Gaza humanitarian [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1800.16s)]
*  foundation early in the day saying that its trucks were loaded and ready to go. It planned [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1807.6000000000001s)]
*  in the next week to reach 1 million Palestinians. That's half of the population [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1814.08s)]
*  of the strip. It's supposed to be working out of this handful of distribution sites, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1818.64s)]
*  really concentrated in the South and its work will involve using armed security contract. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1823.52s)]
*  Yeah. So this is huge, right? The, the, the humanitarian, the Gaza humanitarian foundation [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1830.8s)]
*  is a, a humanitarian aid organization, or at least like is masquerading as a humanitarian [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1839.8400000000001s)]
*  aid organization, but it's actually created with the express purpose of dominating the strip [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1848.32s)]
*  and basically creating traps in what Israel considers sterile zones, right? Cleaned areas [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1856.4s)]
*  in an effort to, to trap Palestinians and potentially as Jeremy scales as like almost [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1864.4s)]
*  like a Looney Tunes style contraption, like trap Palestinians and then forcibly remove them from [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1872.24s)]
*  the Gaza strip by dangling aid, limited amounts of aid in front of them. Okay. This is super [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1877.76s)]
*  illegal. Like it's, it's stuff that America has only entertained in clandestine operations, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1886.16s)]
*  knowing full well of how illegal it is. Okay. This is like what we are talking about right here [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1893.1200000000001s)]
*  has, I don't think ever been conducted in broad daylight in front of people's eyes in this [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1900.0s)]
*  cartoonish way ever before in this day and age, especially with like the, the immediate [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1905.52s)]
*  information that you can get. It's like doing the final solution in broad daylight, which [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1912.4s)]
*  Israel is also doing. Okay. The goal here, the goal here for Israel is to specifically, [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1916.72s)]
*  to specifically create concentration camps within the already existing open air prison. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1925.6000000000001s)]
*  That is a concentration camp that's turned into a death camp, right? In the Gaza strip, but [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1930.88s)]
*  make it smaller, like make those concentration camps smaller and make Gaza unlivable as they [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1939.44s)]
*  have already worked to make it unlivable and utilize the aid, the limited amount of aid that [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1946.08s)]
*  they let into the strip to trap Palestinians and then basically kicked them out, like forcibly, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1952.24s)]
*  ethnically displace them. Here is Ahmet Al-Ghobari, a freelance Yemeni journalist, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1962.96s)]
*  talking about this plan saying, come for food, don't go back. That's the chilling logic behind [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1970.0s)]
*  a new Israeli aid plan for Gaza is not just about delivering aid. It's about redrawing Gaza's [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1973.92s)]
*  population map under the guise. And of course, a lot of people, a lot of people have been critical [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1978.4s)]
*  of this, including the United Nations, because this concept is directly at odds. Like you cannot, [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1986.16s)]
*  you cannot be the belligerent party that will then use a military that is aligned with your [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=1996.3999999999999s)]
*  belligerent party or your own mercenaries that you've bought and paid for to distribute aid [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2006.32s)]
*  in the process of doing an ethnic cleansing. Like it makes no goddamn sense. There has to be [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2012.3999999999999s)]
*  an international organization or a non-government organization specifically that does not fly the [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2017.12s)]
*  flag of Israel that is distributing this aid. That's the whole purpose. This is why the United [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2022.64s)]
*  Nations immediately was like, we can't work with this. This is impossible. Like this is completely, [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2028.5600000000002s)]
*  completely unacceptable. It goes against the whole purpose of humanitarian aid. Okay. Israel also [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2034.0800000000002s)]
*  simultaneously has been doing this crazy thing. Again, incredibly depraved thing for months now, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2040.48s)]
*  utilizing ISIS, like straight up utilizing ISIS and criminal elements within the Gaza Strip [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2048.24s)]
*  to actually steal aid, arming them, and even giving them like official protection from drones, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2055.52s)]
*  or with drones rather, with Israeli drones to allow them to go and steal the fucking aid [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2064.3199999999997s)]
*  at the point of distribution. And now they've taken it one step further. They're actually letting [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2069.8399999999997s)]
*  these guys do the distribution of the aid. Hamas in the past has been able to at least like [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2076.16s)]
*  find the criminal elements and kill them and put together like a curfew. But Israel is doing its [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2082.48s)]
*  very best to ensure that that instability continues. Did you say ISIS in Gaza? Yes, of course. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2092.0s)]
*  There are ISIS aligned ISIS affiliates in Gaza. There has been a consistent back and forth. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2099.6s)]
*  There have been warring factions inside of Gaza as well. Yes. We're going to look for an article [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2107.68s)]
*  talking about this. Dropsite has covered this. I believe Haaretz has actually ironically covered [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2112.4s)]
*  this as well. But here is one quick point on it. ISIS link gang leader behind Gaza aid looting [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2118.96s)]
*  resurface under Israeli protection in Gaza criminal gang leader Yasser Abu Shabab and others [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2126.8s)]
*  like him have re-emerged under the guise of securing aid, donning uniforms and claiming to [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2131.04s)]
*  protect the limited humanitarian assistance entering the strip. Quds News Network reports [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2134.7200000000003s)]
*  that Abu Shabab has established a fortified base in an Israeli controlled zone in Ra'afah, [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2138.7200000000003s)]
*  now a kill zone. These groups operate under Israeli military protection, routinely looting [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2143.04s)]
*  aid convoys, especially in areas like Eastern Ra'afah and Kerem Abu Salim, Kerem Shalom. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2147.52s)]
*  Abu Shabab is a known leader of armed gangs linked to ISIS and involved in looting aid under [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2152.88s)]
*  Israeli protection. Last year, the new Arab reported that Abu Shabab among others was [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2157.28s)]
*  working alongside hundreds of thieves under the protection of Israeli occupation forces [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2161.04s)]
*  near the Kerem Shalom crossing. The primary entry point for aid convoys. He comes from the [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2164.7200000000003s)]
*  Tarabin Bedouin tribe, which spans from Sinai to Southern Gaza and the Negev desert and has [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2170.8s)]
*  been identified in a UN memo as the main influential figure behind the widespread [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2175.76s)]
*  and organized looting of aid convoys in Gaza. There was a Haaretz article on it as well. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2180.16s)]
*  The Israeli army is allowing gangs in Gaza to loot aid trucks and extort protection fees from [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2185.6s)]
*  drivers. They are doing it under the watchful gaze of the Israeli occupation. The Israeli [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2190.0s)]
*  occupation does not want the aid to be distributed evenly to the Palestinian population. This is why [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2197.12s)]
*  they've executed the police force in Gaza as well and then claimed that they were fucking Hamas. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2201.92s)]
*  Yeah, no shit. Everyone that is working on the civilian side is also a part of the Hamas party. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2208.64s)]
*  Okay. That doesn't mean that they're fucking militants against Israel. And yet that doesn't [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2214.72s)]
*  matter. They're literally killing like trash collectors and saying, well, this was a Hamas [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2219.8399999999997s)]
*  trash collector. It's like, yeah, I know. Or they'll kill fucking the family members of this doctor. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2224.3199999999997s)]
*  And then they'll go, hey, well, this doctor has photos wearing a Hamas banner. And it's like, [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2231.7599999999998s)]
*  yeah, dude, because that's the governing fucking party of Gaza. What do you mean? Of course. It's [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2237.84s)]
*  like saying, well, sorry, these guys are fucking Republicans. So we just have to kill every single [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2244.1600000000003s)]
*  child in the region because their parents were Republicans. There's a difference between being [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2248.8s)]
*  an enemy combatant and being a supporter of a fucking party. It's so mind boggling that 19 [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2254.6400000000003s)]
*  months in and we still can't make this distinction between non-combatants. The same goes for the [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2261.6s)]
*  journalists that they assassinated, Hassan. They literally killed him. They shot him when he was [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2269.6s)]
*  in a tent. They burned him alive. And then he somehow survived that first process. And he was [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2276.88s)]
*  in a hospital when Israel killed him in his hospital bed while he was recovering in his fucking hospital [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2283.68s)]
*  bed. And then they said, well, he was, you know, there's a photo of him and Yahya Sinwar. Okay. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2288.88s)]
*  So what? So the fuck what? What do you mean? They literally said the reason why they killed him [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2296.96s)]
*  was because he had entered alongside Hamas militants into Israel proper on October 7. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2301.92s)]
*  Yeah, he's a fucking journalist, dude. Yeah, see? Oh, you're talking about Shabab, this guy. Yeah. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2310.56s)]
*  It doesn't make any fucking sense. Of course, he's a god. No, I'm not talking about Hassan Shabbat. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2317.12s)]
*  I'm talking about one of the most famous photojournalists in Gaza. Hassan, what's his [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2321.6s)]
*  Islaia? I think. Yeah, Hassan Islaia is one of the most famous. Hassan Shabbat also was killed by [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2329.36s)]
*  Israel, obviously. But Hassan Islaia is an incredibly famous photojournalist. And yes, he also [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2339.44s)]
*  documented the Hamas militancy and the Al-Aqsa flood. Yes, he did that. He's a fucking journalist. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2351.92s)]
*  Of course he did that. What do you mean? Like, this is insane. The idea that like, oh, he was [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2359.76s)]
*  documenting what fucking Hamas was doing at the Al-Aqsa flood or what PFLP was doing in the Al-Aqsa [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2365.52s)]
*  flood on October 7. That's the reason why we killed him is an insane admission, right? Like, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2374.96s)]
*  that is an insane admission. You're saying like you killed a journalist because he was doing [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2382.24s)]
*  journalism. Anyway, multiple reports, including from Haaretz and the Washington Post, confirmed [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2385.92s)]
*  that these gangs have been seen looting in full view of Israeli forces who neither intervene nor [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2393.7599999999998s)]
*  prevent the theft. Abu Shabab, recent active again on social media, boasts of his gang's coordination [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2397.6s)]
*  while his armed men beat aid drivers and demand protection money, worsening conditions for the [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2403.04s)]
*  starving population. Meanwhile, Israel has systematically targeted Palestinian police [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2406.8799999999997s)]
*  and security officers assigned to guard aid deliveries. Despite international pressure, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2411.68s)]
*  only a trickle of aid has been allowed in, with Israel striking those attempting to protect it. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2415.68s)]
*  While Israel enables and facilitates the looting, its propaganda blames Hamas for stealing aid, [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2420.32s)]
*  deflecting responsibility and masking its own role in orchestrating chaos and famine in Gaza. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2425.5200000000004s)]
*  This is the guy. Think about that. Hassan Islaye. Hassan Islaye, sorry. I mean, this is also one of [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2430.7200000000003s)]
*  those things that like, this is one of those things that like most people don't even know about, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2441.36s)]
*  right? They just hear like Hamas is stealing aid. No evidence for this at all from Israel. As a [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2445.68s)]
*  matter of fact, Israel's revealed that they have no evidence for this at all. And the only thing [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2450.3999999999996s)]
*  they have to show for it is like these fucking criminal gangs that get to steal this aid and get [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2455.8399999999997s)]
*  to loot this aid literally in direct view of the Israeli drones. And the Israeli drones don't shoot [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2461.12s)]
*  these guys, even though they're armed, but they shoot the actual fucking civilian police force. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2470.0s)]
*  They bomb the civilian police force for actually apprehending and killing these fucking ISIS [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2476.72s)]
*  affiliate gangs. Sounds like Hassan is a liar. Brother, what are you saying? Like it is, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2483.04s)]
*  when I tell you something, there is a million different points backing up that statement. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2491.12s)]
*  Okay. Just because you have never encountered this information before his name law. What is it? [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2499.36s)]
*  It's a, Oh, he was saying was, Oh, he was talking about the other guy. Oh, okay. I misunderstood. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2505.84s)]
*  Sorry. I thought you were coming in here to be like, you're lying. He's talking about the photo [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2513.84s)]
*  journalist. Yeah. Here is Muhammad Shahada Israeli backed ISIS linked warlord, drug leader and gang [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2517.2000000000003s)]
*  leader. Yasser Abu Shabab is back this time suited up in brand new military gear, manning a checkpoint [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2523.84s)]
*  in Rafa under IDF protection. Abu Shabab's gang have been the key culprits of looting aid with [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2529.28s)]
*  Israel's blessing. The looting often happened about a hundred meters away from Israeli tanks [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2535.0400000000004s)]
*  and troops. No Gazan is allowed in the Rafa, which Israel depopulated and declared an extermination [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2538.7200000000003s)]
*  zone. Meaning any Gazan that walks in Rafa is murdered immediately by Israeli troops. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2543.76s)]
*  So to see Abu Shabab and Rafa showing off his gun and military gear provided to him by Israel [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2547.76s)]
*  is extremely concerning sign of what lies ahead. Haaretz has also confirmed the existence of these [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2552.7200000000003s)]
*  gangs that are looting the aid under IDF protection and their affiliations with groups like ISIS. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2557.84s)]
*  The Washington Post said those gangs establish a military like compound in Rafa from which they [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2565.28s)]
*  loot aid. Here it is. I saw one Israeli tank and a Palestinian arm of the Kalashnikov rival, just [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2569.84s)]
*  a hundred meters from it. A senior official from one organization working in Gaza tells Haaretz, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2573.92s)]
*  the armed men beat the drivers and take all the food if they aren't paid protection money. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2578.32s)]
*  It's so bad that the fucking UAE called it out and the UAE has no sympathies for the Palestinian [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2583.04s)]
*  population whatsoever. Remember UAE alongside Saudi Arabia are two of the biggest Israel [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2591.36s)]
*  dick riders in the region. UAE condemns Israel for forcing aid trucks to go through red zones [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2596.48s)]
*  where Israel backed ISIS link criminal gangs and drug dealers loot aid under IDF protection. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2601.2s)]
*  UAE says out of 24 trucks that entered yesterday, only one arrived safely to the warehouses. UAE [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2606.8s)]
*  was supposed to bring 103 trucks into Gaza yesterday, but Israel only allowed in 24. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2611.92s)]
*  Red zones is what Israel calls extermination zones like Rafa at the moment, which connotates areas [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2618.48s)]
*  where no Gazan is allowed and anyone stepping a foot in them is instantly killed or detained. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2623.28s)]
*  Several gangs operate in those red zones under full IDF protection who always only fire at [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2628.08s)]
*  policemen that try to prevent looting. Crazy how you're not perma banned yet, which is hella biased. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2632.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm sorry that there is at least one fucking outlet out there where you can actually learn [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2637.52s)]
*  exactly what is going on in Gaza as opposed to like consistently telling you that what Israel [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2643.92s)]
*  is doing is right and we should just continue the genocide because it's morally the correct thing to [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2649.28s)]
*  do. I know, I know that the truth scares you. I know that the truth makes you feel really bad, [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2654.16s)]
*  but there is an alternative reality here where you could just not additional support for Israel, [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2660.56s)]
*  you know, that's, that's one thing that you could do. You could make a sober and reasonable [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2666.72s)]
*  assessment of the situation by analyzing the information that I'm presenting to you, [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2672.64s)]
*  because these are from trusted mainstream resources, not like I'm just making shit up. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2677.52s)]
*  Okay, why is that so hard to comprehend? Like why, why is that so difficult where you're just like, [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2683.8399999999997s)]
*  no, I don't want to see it. What happened to all of these like right wingers and shit that initially [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2689.52s)]
*  there's no way to think that everything you see that's reported on the subject is everything. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2696.72s)]
*  I just don't, I don't understand. I don't understand why these guys who used to, [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2700.16s)]
*  these guys who used to talk about how like a biased libtards are and, and free speech, [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2706.16s)]
*  and how liberals don't want to hear the uncomfortable truths have now come in here [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2713.2799999999997s)]
*  and are basically doing the exact same fucking posturing that they used to rail against over [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2718.64s)]
*  and over again. And I don't even think these guys ride for America this hard. You know what I mean? [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2723.12s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense for them to have this level of fucking loyalty to the state of Israel [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2727.44s)]
*  is a foreign country. Anyway, let's continue. I don't understand how anyone remotely affiliated [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2732.96s)]
*  with ISIS. We want to do anything with anything to do with Israel. Unless they were actively [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2737.68s)]
*  shooting at them. Brother Israel has directly collaborated with ISIS affiliates in Syria as [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2741.2s)]
*  well. ISIS is basically a state department cutout. Who do you think was allowing ISIS to continue [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2746.64s)]
*  operating in Syria even by way of a third party, specifically Turkey, Israel, [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2754.0s)]
*  Israel has always cooperated with ISIS. Israel has treated ISIS militants in its hospitals. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2762.96s)]
*  Israel's offered logistical support to ISIS militants in Syria. I think unironically, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2770.96s)]
*  the reason they ride so hard for Israel is because it pisses you off. The beginning and [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2776.0s)]
*  end of their ideology is whatever Hassan says. I'm going to do the opposite. I know, but that's [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2779.76s)]
*  such a sad way to live at a certain point. At a certain point, you have to be like, maybe this [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2783.36s)]
*  isn't, you know, at a certain point, you got to be like, am I this much of a bot? Am I this much [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2788.96s)]
*  of a fucking MPC that like my whole worldview revolves around just like hating this one guy, [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2794.56s)]
*  a fucking Twitch streamer and, and deciding that my position is whatever the opposite is [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2801.2s)]
*  of his position. Like you're basically comatose and look at vegetable. It's the pathetic way to [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2808.3199999999997s)]
*  live. Anyway, this is the Horace article. Defense officials confirmed that IDF is aware of the [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2813.92s)]
*  problem. They said that at one making these clans to which the armed men belong responsible for [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2820.08s)]
*  distributing aid to Gaza's residents, even though some of the clients members are involved in [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2824.7999999999997s)]
*  terrorism and some are even affiliated with extreme organizations like the Islamic state. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2828.64s)]
*  So when you hear people talk about like, Oh, Hamas is looting aid. It is the exact opposite. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2832.3199999999997s)]
*  Israel one does not let aid get into the Gaza strip. And then the aid that it lets into the [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2837.04s)]
*  Gaza strip is marginal is minimal. It's nowhere near the amount of aid necessary for 2 million [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2842.8799999999997s)]
*  people that are currently trapped within the Gaza strip. Okay. And then they want chaos at the point [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2849.92s)]
*  of distribution as well. They want chaos at the point of distribution. They want footage that they [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2857.76s)]
*  can point to, to be like, see, these guys are stealing the aid, the claim that it's actually [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2862.4s)]
*  Hamas stealing the aid. And if you were to follow this to its logical conclusion, you would realize [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2867.36s)]
*  that it's also idiotic in and of itself. It's this, it's this idea where it's like, well, [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2874.1600000000003s)]
*  they're stealing the aid Hamas is stealing the aid. Why? Because they're stealing the aid because [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2879.76s)]
*  they want to sell the aid. Okay. So they're going to sell the aid to who? Like they're going to make [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2885.84s)]
*  money off of selling this aid. Okay. What are they going to do with the money? Let's say that there's [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2891.1200000000003s)]
*  money in the strip to give to Hamas for this aid. What will they do with that money? Oh, they'll [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2897.04s)]
*  purchase weapons. How from who, how are they purchasing? What are they purchasing with the [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2904.6400000000003s)]
*  money that they're getting? You think Hamas is what trying to buy like a PlayStation five is that [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2909.36s)]
*  was going on. They want to get the new Nvidia. They want to get the new Nvidia GPUs. I guess [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2914.24s)]
*  they want to do Bitcoin mining or something. Like I've made this joke before. We're like, where do [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2920.16s)]
*  you, what do you think? Like you think there's like a, like a Resident Evil style merchant in one of [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2925.6s)]
*  these fucking tunnels where it's like, Oh, welcome to my welcome to welcome to my shop. Here you can [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2930.3199999999997s)]
*  purchase all of the best weapons. Like where do you think the, the webs are going to materialize? [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2939.36s)]
*  Like you think they're just going to, you think there's like a, like a potion vendor somewhere in [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2944.32s)]
*  the tunnel system? Yeah. It's just so idiotic. Even when you, even when you, yeah, it's like a, [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2949.44s)]
*  like a dark souls merchant where you are in the middle of a dungeon and there's like a crazy [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2955.6800000000003s)]
*  inaccessible area where there's like a dark souls merchant. That's how it is for Hamas. They have [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2961.2000000000003s)]
*  like a, like a weapons procurement guy in the middle of the fucking crowded tunnel systems. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2967.52s)]
*  Yeah. Come take a look at my potions. Fine traveler. Welcome. Like none of it makes sense. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2974.08s)]
*  Here is one more point on the, the aid looting and the aid theft stuff as well. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2980.24s)]
*  Here is we're a world food program director, Cindy McCain, who is the wife of [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2986.64s)]
*  the John McCain. Okay. John McCain who died, John McCain, who was a major Israel Dick writer, [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=2995.44s)]
*  mind you a major Neocon major Israel Dick writer, John McCain who passed away. His fucking wife [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3003.28s)]
*  is the head world food program. And she went on Face the Nation to address these remarks being [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3010.5600000000004s)]
*  made, these lies being made by the Israeli government. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3018.7200000000003s)]
*  This manmade catastrophe with Israeli authorities blocking the entry of all aid from March until [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3024.7200000000003s)]
*  about May 18th. The Trump administration said Israel needs to let in food. So are your deliveries [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3031.6800000000003s)]
*  consistently now getting through? Well, let's start with the fact that this is a catastrophe [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3038.16s)]
*  and you're absolutely correct. And I'm very grateful that you're covering this issue. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3044.16s)]
*  They have let a few trucks in. This is a drop in the bucket as to what's needed. Right now we have [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3049.2s)]
*  500,000 people inside of Gaza that are, that are extremely food insecure and could be on the [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3055.8399999999997s)]
*  verge of famine. If we don't help bring them back from that, we need to get in and we need to get in [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3063.3599999999997s)]
*  at scale, not just a few dribble of the trucks. Right now, as I said, it's a drop in the bucket. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3069.04s)]
*  So how many trucks need to be getting in daily to address the scale of the need you see? And [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3074.72s)]
*  can they get into northern Gaza? Well, prior to the, you know, during the ceasefire, I should say, [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3080.72s)]
*  we were getting in 600 trucks a day. Right now we're getting in maybe 100, something like that. So [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3088.4s)]
*  it's not nearly enough and it needs to be going to the correct places. So the various gates, [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3094.96s)]
*  it's inconsistent as to how the gates are open. It's inconsistent as to the roads we can use. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3100.64s)]
*  The roads that are the better roads, the ones that can get us further along aren't open at all. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3105.68s)]
*  It's complicated right now. And again, I will tell anybody who will listen, we need to get in [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3110.64s)]
*  and get in at scale and be allowed to feed these people before a further catastrophe occurs. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3115.68s)]
*  Your organization announced at least 15 of your trucks were looted when they entered southern [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3121.7599999999998s)]
*  Gaza en route to bakeries. Israel has consistently said that the looting is being carried out by [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3127.44s)]
*  Hamas. Have you seen evidence that it is Hamas stealing the food? By the way, Westerners that [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3135.12s)]
*  work on the ground say that this is not true. The United Nations says that this is not true. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3141.2799999999997s)]
*  Numerous NGOs said that this is not true, but Israel says it's true. So we just got to take [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3146.96s)]
*  it and take their met their word. Even though we also recognize that they're currently doing a [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3152.1600000000003s)]
*  fucking ethnic cleansing campaign, that they're not even like shying away from entertaining as [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3156.96s)]
*  an ethnic cleansing campaign. Like they're openly saying we're doing the final solution [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3161.92s)]
*  right now. And there are still people, there are still people in the United States of America, [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3166.1600000000003s)]
*  they just go, I don't know, maybe when they're saying this stuff, I just got to take it seriously. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3172.4s)]
*  I mean, it's a state, it's a state actor, you know, food. No, not at all. Not, not in this round. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3176.88s)]
*  Listen, these people are desperate and they see a world food program truck coming in and they [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3185.6800000000003s)]
*  run for it. This, this doesn't have anything to do with Hamas or any kind of organized crime or [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3191.76s)]
*  anything. It has simply to do with the fact these people are starving to death. And so we will [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3197.76s)]
*  continue to go in, we will continue to go in with food and the kinds of supplies we need to help [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3202.88s)]
*  the bakeries operate and make sure that we can continue to do that and hopefully be able to do [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3208.2400000000002s)]
*  more of it. But again, we can't do this unless the world community puts pressure on this. We [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3213.36s)]
*  can't be allowed to sit back and watch these people starve to death with no outside diplomatic [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3219.44s)]
*  influence to help us. These, these, these poor souls are really, really, really desperate. And [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3224.16s)]
*  you know, having been in a food riot myself some years ago, I understand the desperation very well. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3231.04s)]
*  Well, five days ago, Prime Minister Netanyahu vowed to take control of all. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3237.6s)]
*  Even addressing the false argument that aid is being stolen, this approach doesn't make sense. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3242.24s)]
*  If food is being stolen by Hamas and selling by weapons, if you make food less scarce, then it [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3245.3599999999997s)]
*  won't be valuable. So flood the zone with food. But Israel also admitted that they were cutting [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3248.56s)]
*  off aid, the pressure on Hamas is so stupid. Israel's not used to doing any sort of lying [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3252.08s)]
*  that makes sense. Yeah, because there is no pushback until recently. Okay. There is no pushback [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3256.3199999999997s)]
*  until recently towards Israel being able to say whatever the hell they want to say. And everyone [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3264.7999999999997s)]
*  going, well, the opposition are our barbaric, rapist, monster terrorists. So obviously we have [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3271.68s)]
*  to trust Israel on this because it's a state actor against a non-state actor, you know, [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3276.24s)]
*  all the while there are tons of aid that's sitting right outside of the boundary. Okay. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3281.36s)]
*  At Israeli checkpoints that Israel refuses to let in the, the like, think about that. It's not like [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3287.36s)]
*  there isn't aid that's waiting, right? It's not like there isn't just simply no aid, like no one [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3293.44s)]
*  cares about the Palestinians. Like no one has spent money on this. There aren't people who are [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3299.04s)]
*  desperately trying to go into the strip to feed the Palestinian population. All of that has already [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3303.28s)]
*  happened. We have fundraised millions of dollars. Okay. Tens of millions of dollars globally. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3308.32s)]
*  There are organizations to go in. They are desperate to go in and actually help the [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3315.6000000000004s)]
*  Palestinian population. And yet, what? Human animals not getting food? Human, the human animals [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3320.48s)]
*  are not getting food. What? What are you saying? And Israel is blocking that aid. One must ask the [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3327.44s)]
*  question, why? One must ask the question, why? Like this is insane. Why does Israel get to dictate [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3333.04s)]
*  how much aid goes into the region? Why does Israel get to dictate what amount of food goes in to the [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3339.12s)]
*  Gaza Strip? All of Gaza, which seems to be a shift from going in, carrying out raids, and then [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3347.52s)]
*  withdrawing. We've seen the Pope speak out. We've seen the leaders of France, of Canada, of the UK [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3353.2s)]
*  calling the cutting of aid egregious. Netanyahu said criticism like that is feeding Hamas and [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3359.6s)]
*  really feeding anti-Semitism. And they do this thing where it's like, oh, you're saying the truth [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3369.12s)]
*  about what's going on in the strip. You are Hamas. Now, in the beginning, post October 7, [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3374.72s)]
*  when someone were to say that, when someone were to brand you as like a Hamas sympathizer, [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3382.24s)]
*  right? When people weren't aware of the dynamic, when people weren't aware of the asymmetry, [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3387.2s)]
*  when people weren't aware of like how Israel normally operates in these circumstances, [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3391.7599999999998s)]
*  that was a marker that you were a disloyal person, disloyal to Western interests, disloyal to the [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3397.44s)]
*  truth. You were like a propaganda, a scary, dangerous, terrorism supporting propaganda that [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3404.96s)]
*  must be destroyed. Ironically enough, 19 months of negatively polarizing people away from Israel [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3409.92s)]
*  and presenting the only other opposition party as Hamas, people have become sympathetic. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3418.88s)]
*  People like no longer can you just say like, oh, you're a Hamas sympathizer, and it hits the same [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3423.84s)]
*  exact way. It doesn't work anymore. It doesn't work at all. And the same would go for the same [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3427.92s)]
*  would go for overall like the anti-Semitism allegations. In the past, when someone were to [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3434.96s)]
*  say like you're anti-Semitic for saying these things about Israel, most people would be worried [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3439.92s)]
*  in progressive circles to even see you as like an ally. And now that's completely gone. The [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3446.8s)]
*  anti-Semitism, like the you are against Israel, you're anti-Semitic. That does not work at all. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3455.68s)]
*  There is no more institutional motion in that regard. The Nazis are really happy that it's on [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3462.8s)]
*  a streaming. Oh, you mean you're saying that they're sarcastically, I suspect, because they [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3468.48s)]
*  are very upset. Of that pushback from him that criticisms of the state are feeding hate. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3474.0800000000004s)]
*  What I do know is they're not feeding people. And the most important part of this is that's [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3481.76s)]
*  what we're supposed to be doing. I'm very grateful for anyone, the Pope, any of the folks that did [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3486.0800000000004s)]
*  shout out and said, listen, we need to get more in. But I can't tell you as to what exactly what [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3492.2400000000002s)]
*  Netanyahu is thinking or anything else. What I do know for a fact is that we need food to get into [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3497.92s)]
*  Gaza to avoid an utter catastrophe. The Israeli army had announced aid will be distributed under [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3503.2000000000003s)]
*  what they described as an American plan. Prime Minister Netanyahu said it'll be American companies [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3510.48s)]
*  giving food directly to Palestinian families in safe zones secured by the Israeli military. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3517.12s)]
*  There's reporting in the Washington Post that these are armed private contractors doing logistics. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3523.04s)]
*  Palestinians will have to submit to identity checks to be fed. And that would replace the UN [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3529.2799999999997s)]
*  coordinated. This is insane. It completely goes against the mission, the humanitarian mission of [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3535.52s)]
*  humanitarian organizations. Okay. The reason why humanitarian organizations are non-government [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3541.52s)]
*  organizations, even though they still obviously have in many instances, allegiances to the American [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3548.72s)]
*  State Department. But the reason why they at least have to make it seem as though they are [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3555.04s)]
*  not operating under the banner of a fucking banner of a state that is like aligned with the [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3560.64s)]
*  belligerent occupier is because you can't make this aid distribution a part of your violent [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3567.84s)]
*  ambitions in the region. Like it doesn't make sense. The same country that is like supplying [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3576.56s)]
*  the bombs is also stopping the distribution at aid or deciding who gets to have the aid. Like [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3583.44s)]
*  that's insane. Now you are using aid as another weapon against the Palestinian civilian population. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3591.84s)]
*  It's terrifying. The notion that you get to distribute aid at the point of, I mean, [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3600.48s)]
*  you get to distribute aid and use that as another way to manipulate the Palestinian population is [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3609.2000000000003s)]
*  insane. Networks, presumably also the World Food Program. Do you know how much longer you will be [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3613.6800000000003s)]
*  allowed to operate in Gaza? I've not seen a plan from anybody. We continue to operate doing what we [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3621.12s)]
*  do best and we are the largest and the best at what we do, I might add. A plan has never been [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3628.7999999999997s)]
*  proposed to us. We haven't heard in the press, at least from the administration, any of the details [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3636.88s)]
*  either, but we do know that the U.S. Ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, announced back on May 9th [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3643.2s)]
*  that this is going to be a U.S. initiative involving only Israeli security. The Israelis are [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3649.04s)]
*  not distributing food. Secretary Rubio was just in Rome. He said he did meet with you. Did you share [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3654.72s)]
*  with him? Well, we had a very frank discussion about exactly what was going on and what we could [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3661.04s)]
*  do to help alleviate a lot of this. Some of it, I'm not sure that they were completely clear on how [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3666.48s)]
*  we operate and the size that we are and the logistics ability that we have to be able to do [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3672.8s)]
*  so. We had a very nice discussion, as you know, the Rubio family and the McCain family have been [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3679.2s)]
*  friends for a very long time and so I was grateful that he would take the time to listen to what we [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3685.52s)]
*  had to say and let us discuss exactly how we feel we should be able to operate. Did he assure you [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3691.12s)]
*  that the U.S. supports the UN and the World Food Program continuing to supply food in Gaza? [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3697.68s)]
*  We didn't really discuss the U.S. participation in any of this. He was really, really concerned [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3702.56s)]
*  with and really trying to understand how we operate and the need for exactly what we do. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3708.32s)]
*  We will work with anybody as long as it feeds people and feeds people safely, I might add, [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3714.48s)]
*  on the ground and keeps our people and people from other agencies safe as well. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3720.8s)]
*  Executive Director of the World Food Program, Cindy McCain, thank you for your time this morning. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3726.8s)]
*  Thank you for your time this morning. Have this man. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3730.4s)]
*  Yeah. So it's not been seven weeks since Israel recommended its bombing starvation [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3733.92s)]
*  campaign in Gaza. I know the agenda setting Sunday shows. Okay. So this is now officially [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3738.88s)]
*  changed. They are finally addressing the humanitarian aid. Okay. They're finally [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3743.44s)]
*  addressing the aid distribution crisis that is unfolding and also having the likes of Cindy [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3748.7200000000003s)]
*  McCain openly explain the situation on the ground and how different that is. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3755.44s)]
*  Having a white Western face associated with this is incredibly important for white Western [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3761.28s)]
*  audiences. Okay. It's just the unfortunate byproduct. It's the unfortunate reality. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3766.4s)]
*  So the very fact that this shift has this market shift is taking place is important. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3772.4s)]
*  It's not something that I'm just going to fucking cast aside. All right. It's the same principle [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3779.52s)]
*  behind how these organizations work like Doctors Without Borders. It's supposed to be a fucking [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3785.28s)]
*  white human shield. Okay. That's the whole point is you have Westerners, you have Westerners putting [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3791.6000000000004s)]
*  their bodies on the line to create a human shield in areas where even Israel is not allowed to [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3799.28s)]
*  attack and they still do it regardless because they're fucking insane and America doesn't give [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3807.92s)]
*  a shit and America itself is also obviously under Obama, for example, attacked the Doctors [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3811.76s)]
*  Without Borders hospital. So, you know, there is there is that one other side of the story [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3816.48s)]
*  that I'm going to get to now is the the head of the new Gaza aid system, right? The Gaza [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3823.92s)]
*  aid system, which is bullshit. It's not real resigns over lack of autonomy. Jake Wood, as we covered, [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3830.88s)]
*  is a Marine sniper turned mercenary. Okay, Marine sniper private military contractor. He is supposed [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3837.6s)]
*  to be in charge of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation and he had given interviews to mainstream media, [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3848.16s)]
*  as I talked about before. And now Jake Wood, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, saying it was not [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3855.8399999999997s)]
*  possible to implement a new Israeli backed aid system in the enclave while remaining neutral [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3863.7599999999998s)]
*  and independent. So when you got a guy who is a fucking Marine sniper turned mercenary [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3868.72s)]
*  saying this is a bridge too far for me, I don't know what the hell, I don't know what the hell [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3877.8399999999997s)]
*  Israel suggested, but goddamn, it must not have been good. I mean, you got like, like, dude, [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3887.12s)]
*  if this is considered unconscionable in the eyes of a guy who is a American Marine sniper turned [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3894.7999999999997s)]
*  mercenary, this like I don't want to be associated. Okay, I don't want to be associated with this shit. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3902.4s)]
*  It's fucked up. Like, think about it. These guys are killers for hire. That's what a mercenary is. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3909.68s)]
*  Yeah, I said Jesus Christ is an American Marine sniper turned mercenary. What the fuck was this [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3916.8s)]
*  plan that this guy said no to it? But you got American serial killers contracted to do hits, [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3922.08s)]
*  saying I can't do this. This is too much. Now, for those of you who don't know, the Gaza [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3928.56s)]
*  Humanitarian Foundation was most likely in Israel and America backed American State Department in [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3933.1200000000003s)]
*  Israel backed organization based out of Switzerland that was supposed to be tasked with being in a fake [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3938.08s)]
*  NGO basically, that works alongside the Israeli occupying force to distribute aid to be the only [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3946.96s)]
*  distributor of aid in the Gaza Strip. Now, why would you need an organization to do this? There [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3954.96s)]
*  are a million organizations that are NGOs that are desperate to get into the fucking strip. It's not [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3960.4s)]
*  like no one is not like there are people that are going I don't want to go into the strip is [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3965.28s)]
*  too dangerous. That's not what they're saying. People know the danger coming from Israel, by the [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3969.36s)]
*  way, because Israel is the one who kills the aid workers, not Hamas. And even then people are like, [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3974.0800000000004s)]
*  No, I'm still going in. I would love to go in. And yet Israel refused to allow any aid into the strip [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3980.0800000000004s)]
*  refused to allow aid workers in the fucking strip. For some weird reason. I wonder why it's because [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3986.32s)]
*  it is a death camp. Okay. It is a death camp. It is a death camp. And they do not want any additional [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=3992.4s)]
*  eyeballs in the death camp to show the truth to the rest of the fucking world. They want to be [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4000.0s)]
*  able to control the aid distribution themselves and use the aid distribution as another way to [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4006.0s)]
*  starve the Gaza population. Another way to basically entrap the Gaza population and detain them [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4010.96s)]
*  and potentially permanently ethnically cleanse them from the area. Now Switzerland has considered [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4016.16s)]
*  investigating the Gaza humanitarian foundations activities as well. And while this authorities [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4023.52s)]
*  are weighing whether to launch a legal investigation into the activities of Gaza humanitarian [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4029.12s)]
*  foundation, a US backed organization that plans to oversee a distribution in Gaza, the move comes [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4032.3199999999997s)]
*  after a Swiss NGO filed a former request on Sunday for an inquiry into the foundation's [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4036.8799999999997s)]
*  aid distribution plans. The UN has criticized the initiative saying it's neither impartial or [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4041.84s)]
*  neutral and will lead to further displacement and put thousands of lives at risk. Trial international [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4046.48s)]
*  a Swiss based NGO said on Friday that it had submitted two legal briefs asking authorities [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4051.44s)]
*  to examine whether the GHF registered in Switzerland is complying with most domestic law and international [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4055.92s)]
*  humanitarian law. The NGO also requested the Swiss foreign ministry to confirm if the GHF had [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4062.56s)]
*  complied with Swiss law by declaring its use of private security firms for aid delivery [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4067.52s)]
*  and whether such measures had received approval from Swiss authorities. And while this is also [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4071.68s)]
*  ongoing, this is another point of pressure. Jake Wood basically said, I'm done, I'm not doing this. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4077.12s)]
*  Now, here is the analysis from the Yemeni journalist Ahmed Al-Ghobari. The US and Israel [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4083.12s)]
*  are backing a new plan to centralize aid through militarized relief hubs. The UN and most aid [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4089.68s)]
*  groups have been sidelined. Okay, private contractors and security checkpoints are now [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4094.88s)]
*  the gatekeepers of food. Key distribution centers are strategically placed south of the [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4100.4800000000005s)]
*  Netzanim corridor. Once people cross the receive aid, they can't return north a one way ticket, [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4105.6s)]
*  not just for food, but for forced displacement. This isn't just speculation. Israeli media [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4110.8s)]
*  confirms this goal. The use the aid as a leverage to clear out the north of Gaza, succeeding where [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4114.96s)]
*  months of war have failed. Jake Wood, the head of the US-backed Gaza humanitarian foundation resigned [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4119.68s)]
*  in protest saying he will not abound in humanitarian principles. He warned the plan compromises [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4124.16s)]
*  neutrality and risks turning aid workers into tools of war. Major humanitarian groups like UN, [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4129.2s)]
*  Oxfam and Mercy Corps are refusing to participate. They're warning the plan violates international [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4135.84s)]
*  norms and humanitarian principles. Meanwhile, Israel aims to take control of 75% of the Gaza [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4141.599999999999s)]
*  Strip within two months. They have declared this as a major objective for the record. It's not like [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4146.5599999999995s)]
*  this is speculative. Most Palestinians will be squeezed into 25% of the strip under constant [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4150.88s)]
*  surveillance with no guarantee of safety or return. Despite mass starvation and warnings from global [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4156.88s)]
*  famine monitors, the current plan offers no long term solution, only strategic containment. Even [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4161.84s)]
*  key donors of the UK and EU are raising red flags. They warned that humanitarian aid must not be [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4168.24s)]
*  politicized or used to engineer demographic shifts. This isn't just an aid story. This is a [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4173.04s)]
*  population control strategy where hunger becomes a weapon and food is traded for displacement. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4177.36s)]
*  And that is precisely where we are. Okay. Jake Wood, the executive director of Gaza [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4183.5199999999995s)]
*  humanitarian foundation stepped down after reports in several news outlets, [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4188.88s)]
*  including the New York Times raised questions about the group's independence and its connections [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4192.08s)]
*  with Israel. Stop sending me the Jeremy Scahill article. I know, I know. Shut the [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4195.5199999999995s)]
*  fuck up. I'm going to cover it. It's literally right here. Okay. It's right here. I know. Stop [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4199.599999999999s)]
*  linking it to me. That is the next step. We haven't even gotten there yet because I'm covering [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4205.04s)]
*  the lack of aid distribution and how Israel is weaponizing aid distribution while simultaneously [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4209.68s)]
*  stopping aid from entering the Gaza Strip. Oh my God. Calm down. It's right there. Okay. It's there. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4215.5199999999995s)]
*  I know. In a statement distributed by the foundation, Mr. Wood said, it is clear that it [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4223.6s)]
*  is not possible to implement this plan while also strictly adhering to the humanitarian principles [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4228.08s)]
*  of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, independence, which I will not abandon. Mr. Wood's departure [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4231.52s)]
*  followed growing acrimony within the traditional aid sector about efforts by Israel to replace [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4237.68s)]
*  the current aid system in Gaza with one overseen by the GHF, a new and untested group founded late [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4241.68s)]
*  last year. They founded this group specifically for all the aid distribution, by the way, to go [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4247.040000000001s)]
*  along with Israel's grand plans of Israel's final solution. The foundation has hired private [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4252.8s)]
*  contractors, including one run by a former CIA officer to secure and distribute food from four [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4258.88s)]
*  sites, sterilized zones. Aid agencies have obviously warned of looming famine since early March when [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4262.4800000000005s)]
*  Israel implemented a blockade on fuel and food into Gaza. And that blockade has only just begun [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4267.84s)]
*  to ease, even though it hasn't really begun to ease at all. That is the New York Times' seasoning [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4273.12s)]
*  on it. It's just an incredibly limited amount of aid that they're allowing into the Strip. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4277.52s)]
*  And then once that aid gets into the Strip, as I covered earlier, it is allowed by ISIS-affiliated [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4282.64s)]
*  gangs in the region under Israeli protection. It is allowed to be looted by these criminal elements [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4288.8s)]
*  in the region, just so you understand. And having Gazans, one representative of each family who's [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4295.28s)]
*  been specially screened crossing Israeli military lines to pick up supplies of food for their family [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4301.84s)]
*  on foot. It's supposed to last them then several days. And, you know, it's been already sort of [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4308.64s)]
*  dismissed by the UN and other aid agencies that have been working in Gaza as being unethical [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4315.84s)]
*  and unworkable. Remember that they operate or have been operating out of something like 400 [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4321.84s)]
*  distribution points. And then just underscoring all the confusion that there is around this newly [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4327.92s)]
*  created organization. We had the executive director, Jake Wood, he's a former US Marine turned [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4334.72s)]
*  social entrepreneur, announcing his resignation. And he said that that was because the plan could [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4341.28s)]
*  not adhere to humanitarian principles, neutrality, impartiality, independence, similar to the [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4347.5199999999995s)]
*  criticisms that we've been having from the UN. But still, you know, Israel says that it wants to [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4353.679999999999s)]
*  change the way the aid is distributed in Gaza. It claims that significant amount of supplies have [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4360.16s)]
*  been diverted to Hamas, something that Hamas denies with the UN and others saying that they [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4366.0s)]
*  have had strong supervision mechanisms to make sure that doesn't happen. And on the ground, [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4370.4s)]
*  Yolande, we're hearing at least 54 Palestinians were killed overnight. And then in the past hour [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4376.08s)]
*  or so, reports that another evacuation order has been issued for Khan Yunus. Where will people go? [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4381.679999999999s)]
*  That's right. People have been told to leave Khan Yunus, in particular to head westwards towards [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4388.16s)]
*  this area along the coast. This is after three rockets were fired from southern Gaza earlier in [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4393.76s)]
*  the day, the Israeli military says, with two of those actually landing inside the strip and one of [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4401.52s)]
*  them intercepted. And, you know, already people in Khan Yunus have been fleeing, making that journey. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4406.88s)]
*  And there is now this plan which is causing a lot of worry being reported in the Israeli media with [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4414.16s)]
*  the army said to be planning over the next two months to take 75% of the Gaza strip and move [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4420.96s)]
*  the two million people of Gaza into three areas, one in the south, one in the centre, [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4430.08s)]
*  one in the heart of Gaza City. Yolande, as we're speaking, I'm also just monitoring the news wires [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4435.5199999999995s)]
*  and we're getting some alerts from Palestinian sources who are talking about a new ceasefire deal. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4442.24s)]
*  What are they referencing there? Do you know? What are the developments on? [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4450.08s)]
*  This part already fell apart early this morning for the record, if you're wondering. And, you know, [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4454.5599999999995s)]
*  make no mistake, of course it fell apart and I'm going to detail that in a second. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4461.04s)]
*  On that front. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4465.36s)]
*  I mean there have been some reports that we've not had confirmed to us of a back channel between [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4466.0s)]
*  Hamas and the Trump administration proposing a 70-day ceasefire for 10 of the hostages that [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4472.4800000000005s)]
*  Hamas is still holding. Of course, it's believed that at least 20 of the hostages are still alive [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4479.2s)]
*  being held inside Gaza. But this is very unclear, the picture that's gone at the moment, [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4487.360000000001s)]
*  there's certainly not been any confirmation that this is something realistic from the Israeli side. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4491.84s)]
*  We did hear as well that there were some talks that were scheduled to happen in Cairo with [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4497.28s)]
*  Egypt being such an important key mediator in the region. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4502.24s)]
*  She stumbles through the flames. Five-year-old Wad Jalal al-Sheikh Khalil, [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4506.8s)]
*  her whole world collapsing beneath her. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4512.32s)]
*  She was on the roof of the Fahmy al-Jajawi school in Gaza City, which was... [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4520.24s)]
*  One other point that I want to mention here, one other point that I want to mention here is that [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4525.28s)]
*  the Israeli embassy staffers were shot and killed and that led mainstream discourse [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4533.2s)]
*  for approximately 48 hours. Okay? And I think this was a big attempt from at least Israeli [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4540.64s)]
*  envoys and those who want to defend Israel to recenter victimhood around both Israel, [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4548.56s)]
*  Israel defenders and Jewish people. Okay? And yet, in spite of that, very quickly, [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4557.6s)]
*  due to Israel's bloodthirsty ambition in the Gaza Strip and the unimaginable cruelty that everyone [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4565.92s)]
*  can see, the media cycle very quickly turned around and is still actively covering the [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4574.8s)]
*  atrocities, which is important to note. Okay? Israel, I think, or at least defenders of [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4581.12s)]
*  Israel thought that this could be another October 7 moment and it did not happen at all. That, I think, [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4590.4800000000005s)]
*  is yet another indication that the broader public, as I stated in my initial coverage of the [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4598.4800000000005s)]
*  shooting, the broader public is aware of the scale of atrocity in Gaza and are not able to... [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4608.240000000001s)]
*  They're not changing their attention or prioritizing people in the West as opposed to [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4619.6s)]
*  the true scale of atrocity that's ongoing in Gaza. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4629.84s)]
*  Okay. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4649.280000000001s)]
*  30 bodies were recovered, but survival is its own punishment. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4650.4800000000005s)]
*  The Israeli drone winds overhead. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4659.92s)]
*  And Ward sits amongst the charred remains, stunned, shocked, traumatized, [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4667.4400000000005s)]
*  but only too aware of what has happened. She escaped with a few cuts and bruises. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4674.24s)]
*  I walked through the fire all by myself. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4683.92s)]
*  But she knows that two of her brothers and her three sisters were killed. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4689.599999999999s)]
*  And what about her parents? Is her father alive? [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4704.5599999999995s)]
*  Her father, from what I understand, is in critical condition, I think. Her father's in the ICU and [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4709.2s)]
*  not expected to survive. Ward's family had eight members and six of them were killed. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4714.24s)]
*  What about her mother? [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4719.2s)]
*  She was killed in the fire. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4721.2s)]
*  She was killed in the fire. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4723.2s)]
*  She was killed in the fire. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4725.2s)]
*  She was killed in the fire. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4727.2s)]
*  She was killed in the fire. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4729.2s)]
*  Her eight members and six of them were killed. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4731.2s)]
*  What about her mother? [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4733.2s)]
*  I love mama as big as the sky and the earth and the stars. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4737.2s)]
*  But her mother is dead too. Her brother Siraj and her father survived, was badly injured. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4741.2s)]
*  One sibling and her father survived, but... [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4751.2s)]
*  She was killed in the fire. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4753.2s)]
*  53,000, 54,000 dead in Gaza and one little girl holding her uncle's hand, [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4757.2s)]
*  who has lost her mum and her sisters and her brothers, who's been displaced multiple times, [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4763.2s)]
*  who has survived to live in a landscape of ruins in a war that has lasted one third of her lifetime [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4769.2s)]
*  and threatens to last even longer because the Israeli government says [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4777.2s)]
*  that it will continue to attack Gaza until victory, whatever that may mean. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4781.2s)]
*  Today... [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4789.2s)]
*  Yeah, the narrative is shifting pretty dramatically. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4791.2s)]
*  This is Channel 4 and Channel 4 has been a lot more critical of Israel from the start, [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4793.2s)]
*  as opposed to like the BBC, okay? [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4801.2s)]
*  But nowadays, Channel 4 is speaking on this with moral clarity in a way that even they never did [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4803.2s)]
*  in the subsequent months after October 7. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4813.2s)]
*  And I think it's because of the insurmountable, unimaginable scale of atrocity and bloodshed. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4817.2s)]
*  Like this is indistinguishable from Al Jazeera coverage. Think about that. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4825.2s)]
*  Think about that. I mean, I'm sure they'll sneak in a little bit of like Palestinians are upset at Hamas in there somewhere. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4829.2s)]
*  Now, it's... I... [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4837.2s)]
*  I mean, words escape me. It's just like even now, I've been covering this every single day. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4841.2s)]
*  But even now, it's just like difficult to say anything beyond like what you are seeing, just the insane cruelty. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4849.2s)]
*  What is the end goal of this insurgency from the captured population? [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4861.2s)]
*  The end goal is permanent ethnic displacement and ethnic cleansing. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4865.2s)]
*  That's Israel's goal. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4869.2s)]
*  They're saying it's because they want to combat Hamas. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4871.2s)]
*  But there's reporting that came out of Haaretz recently that they've only... [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4875.2s)]
*  They've only captured 2,000 plus weapons. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4879.2s)]
*  And additional reporting that came out of Haaretz shows that Israel, at least Israeli officials, claim that there are still 40,000 Hamas militants in the region. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4883.2s)]
*  Now, either they're lying about that in an effort to continue its bombing campaign, to continue their bombing campaign, [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4893.2s)]
*  or a shit ton of people understandably took up arms against Israel and are now being considered a part of the Al Qassam Brigades, a spontaneous militia, [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4898.2s)]
*  which is, by the way, legally the right of all oppressed peoples. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4908.2s)]
*  Make no mistake. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4913.2s)]
*  These guys that are operating within the Gaza Strip, the Israeli occupying force, the Diaper Force, they are illegally operating within the Gaza Strip. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4915.2s)]
*  They have no legal right to do this. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4924.2s)]
*  Any Palestinian that chooses to take up arms against these guys and kill these guys, for the record, make no mistake, have not only a legal responsibility to do so, but a moral one. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4927.2s)]
*  This is international law, okay? [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4938.2s)]
*  Israel, as a belligerent occupier, has no right, no legal right, to bomb the Gaza Strip, to invade the Gaza Strip like this. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4942.2s)]
*  And everyone living in the Gaza Strip has a legal right to fight back against these soldiers, these militants. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4951.2s)]
*  Make no mistake. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4961.2s)]
*  This is not, I'm not saying like, oh, this is unacceptable or whatever. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4963.2s)]
*  I'm just telling you exactly what the international legal authority is. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4967.2s)]
*  And their assessment is on the situation. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4974.2s)]
*  You will hear the exact opposite from mainstream media, but it does not matter. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4977.2s)]
*  Yeah, 5,600 guns, sorry, not 2,000 guns. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4985.2s)]
*  2,600 small arms were seized, even though the IDF claims 20,000 terrorists have been killed. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4989.2s)]
*  IDF publishes a report detailing everything that is seized since the beginning of the fighting in Gaza. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=4996.2s)]
*  2,600 were seized. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5000.2s)]
*  2,600 guns. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5003.2s)]
*  So what happened? [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5005.2s)]
*  How did you kill 20,000 terrorists, as you claim? [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5006.2s)]
*  I guess a lot of unarmed terrorists have been getting killed. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5010.2s)]
*  Anyway, this means that they haven't killed many militants at all, which is, of course, understandable, [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5013.2s)]
*  considering that they are terrified of actually fighting a fair fight. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5022.2s)]
*  And there is no fair fight in this process, regardless, because Israel has so much more power [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5030.2s)]
*  and has the most powerful force on the planet, the United States of America, backing its actions, its militancy. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5037.2s)]
*  And yet, and yet even then, they are truly terrified of actually going into the Strip without air support [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5046.2s)]
*  and instead choose to just bomb every single, choose to bomb every single standing structure in the Strip instead. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5056.2s)]
*  Because their goal is not to actually deal with the Palestinian militancy. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5065.2s)]
*  Their goal is to kill as many Palestinians as possible, starve the entire Palestinian population in Gaza, [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5069.2s)]
*  and eventually move them out, eventually engage in the act of ethnic displacement, ethnic cleansing from the Gaza Strip. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5076.2s)]
*  Just the worst fucking fighting force on the planet, I swear to God. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5084.2s)]
*  Exclusive, a 198 page planning doc reveals that the architects of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5088.2s)]
*  had early concerns that people would compare its planned food hubs and residential compounds with concentration camps, by the way. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5093.2s)]
*  Like, they were aware of how this looks as well. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5099.2s)]
*  So effectively, the soldiers have been sent to divide Gaza into three parts, to control what remains of the population, [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5114.2s)]
*  to control children like Wad, who, if she survives the next attack, will live with loss and grief for the rest of her life. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5123.2s)]
*  And Lindsay joins us now from... [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5134.2s)]
*  So this is going to dovetail into the last portion of the coverage here, which of course is the ceasefire conversation that was taking place [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5136.2s)]
*  and quickly destroyed by Israel and then led to the Trump administration behaving exactly like Anthony Blinken and the Biden administration. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5150.2s)]
*  That happened earlier today. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5160.2s)]
*  Once this coverage is over, I'm going to get to that and I'm going to explain to you why that took place [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5162.2s)]
*  and why Israel cannot let, cannot actually do a ceasefire at any given point until they have permanently ethnically cleansed the Gaza Strip. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5167.2s)]
*  From Jerusalem, Lindsay. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5177.2s)]
*  Kathy, such a contrast, the scene in Gaza and here in Jerusalem tonight. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5181.2s)]
*  I'm at the Damascus Gate, the entrance to the old city, a few yards away inside, right-wing Jews, tens of thousands, are praying and dancing at the Western Wall. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5186.2s)]
*  That's because today is Jerusalem Day, when they celebrate the seizure of Arab East Jerusalem at the end of the war in 1967. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5198.2s)]
*  Now, earlier they were dancing and shouting, death to the Arabs and 1967 Jerusalem in our hands, 2025 Gaza in our hands. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5207.2s)]
*  So you see how the right-wing here are drawing parallels between the two situations. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5219.2s)]
*  Earlier in the day, the right-wing Minister for National Security, Itamar Ben-Ghavir, he went into the old city and up to the Al-Aqsa Mosque. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5224.2s)]
*  That is the third most holy site. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5235.2s)]
*  Guys, don't say that these guys are Nazis, please. That's anti-Semitic. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5238.2s)]
*  Israel has a right to defend itself. And by that I mean Israel has a right to ethnically cleanse the Palestinian population in the Gaza Strip. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5242.2s)]
*  And you do not have a right to criticize such things, because if you criticize such things, that means you're anti-Semitic. Excuse me. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5251.2s)]
*  Right in Islam. So for an Israeli Jewish politician to go there, that's a provocation. It's done on purpose. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5262.2s)]
*  It's been done before, most famously by Ariel Sharon in the year 2000. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5269.2s)]
*  When he was there, he prayed for victory. And it's these far-right ministers who control the Israeli government at the moment. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5274.2s)]
*  And that's why the war continues, even though many military experts say there's no further military reason to do so. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5283.2s)]
*  And that's why we're seeing the tragedies like the Khalil family today and that little girl who you saw in my report. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5292.2s)]
*  Lindsay, thanks very much. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5300.2s)]
*  Earlier, I spoke to Dr. Victoria Rose, a surgeon working in Nasser Hospital in Gaza, and started by asking her about the sorts of injuries she's seeing among the children she's treating. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5303.2s)]
*  Everything we're seeing here at the moment is related to blast bomb injuries. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5313.2s)]
*  So that's mainly burns and quite large percentage burns, the sort of percent that would normally be admitted to an intensive care unit in the UK or a specialist burns unit in the UK and dealt with there. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5318.2s)]
*  And then the other injuries that we're seeing are mainly due to the shrapnel that gets whipped up when a bomb explodes. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5332.2s)]
*  And that's what we're seeing here at Nasser mainly. So it's traumatic amputations of hands, fingers, arms, feet, legs. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5342.2s)]
*  So the most appalling suffering really. Yeah, things that you would never, ever see in any other situation. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5350.2s)]
*  Obviously, this is a doctor of Hamas. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5359.2s)]
*  Obviously, channel four is also channel four for Hamas, channel CH. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5361.2s)]
*  And the volume of it is really the staggering part. It's nonstop. It is women, children. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5371.2s)]
*  It's really, really barbaric what we're seeing here. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5381.2s)]
*  And of course, you're working, as I understand, at the same hospital where doctors Hamdi and Alar work, nine of whose children were killed on Friday and Hamdi himself was injured. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5385.2s)]
*  It must be very hard to get your head around. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5396.2s)]
*  It's been a real shock for the whole hospital, actually, because they were both so well known. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5399.2s)]
*  And it's been really devastating for the rest of the staff to see, you know, almost an entire family wiped out. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5404.2s)]
*  But I have to say that this, what's happened to them is it's not really unusual. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5413.2s)]
*  They're estimating here at the moment that about 2,300 families, entire families, have been wiped off the civil register. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5420.2s)]
*  We know that there's 42,000 orphans here in Gaza at the moment. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5430.2s)]
*  And I think that's the hardest thing for our team here to be dealing with. You often have a child on the table. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5436.2s)]
*  We've got a three year old with a 45% burn at the moment, and he's the only survivor of his family. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5443.2s)]
*  In the context of the horrors that you've just described, clearly aid is essential. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5450.2s)]
*  Fewer than 500 aid trucks have entered Gaza, as I understand it, since the blockade was lifted. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5457.2s)]
*  Are you seeing any of that coming through yet? [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5463.2s)]
*  We have any delivery of the vital equipment that we need, and we are running low on essential equipment now that we can't make do and mend. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5466.2s)]
*  And once we're out, if we don't get any supplies, we will not be able to continue operating. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5476.2s)]
*  There's been a lot of controversy about the organization that's backed by the US and Israel to ensure that private firms deliver aid. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5483.2s)]
*  And the head of that organization has now quit. Do you welcome his decision to do so? Was that plan unworkable? [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5492.2s)]
*  I take my hat off to him for pulling out. I do not understand why a private firm has been brought in to do a job that the United Nations. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5498.2s)]
*  I changed the Chatterino so the badges can be seen again. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5509.2s)]
*  Y'all are silly billies. I don't know why that Chatterino didn't show the badges. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5513.2s)]
*  But here, now you can see your badges once again and flex how many months you have subscribed in the chat. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5519.2s)]
*  One of the many amenities you get as a subscriber. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5526.2s)]
*  And the WHO have been doing perfectly well since this war started. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5531.2s)]
*  Israel says this plan would prevent a humanitarian crisis. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5538.2s)]
*  The food aid is only going to be points and to access those points, you have to give your Palestinian ID and your biometric data. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5541.2s)]
*  And this is the issue that the Palestinians have. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5551.2s)]
*  And you aren't given your food. You are then allowed into the area to take the aid. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5554.2s)]
*  And they believe that this is a way of enforcing them into a smaller part of Gaza. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5559.2s)]
*  There have been reports today that Hamas has agreed to a ceasefire proposal, but Israel has dismissed it. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5566.2s)]
*  From where you're sitting, I'm assuming a deal can't come soon enough. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5572.2s)]
*  It can't come soon enough. I mean, for all sorts of reasons. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5577.2s)]
*  As I said, we're running out of supplies to carry on going. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5581.2s)]
*  But more than that, we are one and a half kilometres from the exit of fighting now. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5587.2s)]
*  So if we are evacuated, those patients will die. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5593.2s)]
*  So it is really critical that we get a ceasefire right now. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5598.2s)]
*  Dr. Victoria Rose, thank you very much for joining us. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5602.2s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5605.2s)]
*  That was Lennon Del Ray. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5607.2s)]
*  Oh, it's no Lennon a Del Ray. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5610.2s)]
*  Anyway, here you have one of Israel's biggest dick riders, the German Chancellor Mertz, [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5615.2s)]
*  saying Israel's actions in Gaza can no longer be justified. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5622.2s)]
*  Now, of course, now you're saying it's no longer justified. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5625.2s)]
*  It's no longer justified since October 8. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5630.2s)]
*  OK, ridiculous. Having said that, the reason but having said that for a German guy to say this is [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5632.2s)]
*  somewhat consequential because these guys have a one proclivity towards fascism to begin with. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5642.2s)]
*  OK, they kind of they're kind of equal opportunity. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5651.2s)]
*  Fascist like they're like, whoever does it, we like it. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5656.2s)]
*  You know, there's that German epigenetic. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5658.2s)]
*  There's that German epigenetic memory kicking in. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5661.2s)]
*  And secondly, gets Dick rider of Israel's like constitutionally protected to to all [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5665.2s)]
*  to offer unlimited support to Israel no matter what. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5671.2s)]
*  It's so much so that the other constitutional value that Germany has is the protection of the International Criminal Court [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5674.2s)]
*  and the International like respecting the institutions of international justice. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5682.2s)]
*  And yet and yet they are willing to erode that part of their fucking constitution because now it's at odds with Israel. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5688.2s)]
*  So make no mistake when you have someone like Mertz saying Israel's actions can no longer be justified. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5698.2s)]
*  That means the rest of the world is completely moved to a normal position. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5705.2s)]
*  That's what the Israeli army is doing in the Gaza Strip. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5712.2s)]
*  I no longer understand, frankly, what its objective is. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5717.2s)]
*  Oh, now he doesn't understand to cause such suffering to the civilian population. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5721.2s)]
*  As an increasingly as has increasingly been the case in recent days, it's not recent days. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5726.2s)]
*  This has been the case since October seven. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5731.2s)]
*  It can no longer be justified as a fight against Hamas terrorism. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5733.2s)]
*  Israel should face an arms and call for arms embargo on Israel as Gaza's children face starvation. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5740.2s)]
*  Again, BBC News, he is lying when he doesn't know what it's that it's planned. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5746.2s)]
*  German arms sales law forbids selling arms if there's a possibility they can be used for war crimes. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5751.2s)]
*  So they ran on we don't know. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5756.2s)]
*  Also, we said two weeks ago that he unconditionally supports Israel no matter what. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5757.2s)]
*  80% of Germans do not support Israel's war against Hamas. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5761.2s)]
*  Quote of the question in the last poll, it's room reading and virtue signaling. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5764.2s)]
*  I know. But in the past, this is no, I know all of this. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5769.2s)]
*  I covered all of this. This is actually how I started talking about this issue. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5773.2s)]
*  Remember when I told you that one, fascism is a suicide pact. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5777.2s)]
*  OK, it is a suicidal ideology, right? [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5783.2s)]
*  And not only is it a suicidal ideology, but if the Western liberal democracies actually continue offering unlimited support to Israel as it is engaging in the fascist act of ethnic cleansing, [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5786.2s)]
*  OK, they will basically create that they will basically show to Western voters and their own populations that like there is no real democratic process here. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5801.2s)]
*  You understand this is the reason why they are changing. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5812.2s)]
*  This is the reason why they're changing their their attitude or at least their messaging around this in an effort to appease. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5816.2s)]
*  Their their voters in an effort to basically try to get them to to quiet down a little bit because they thought they made a mistake. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5825.2s)]
*  They thought that people would just like stop caring about it in the same way that like America's war on terror continued for 20 years and people stopped caring about it after a certain point. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5836.2s)]
*  What do you mean a suicidal ideology? [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5845.2s)]
*  Fascism is inherently contradictory. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5848.2s)]
*  OK, there has to be a permanent out group that must be ethnically displaced or ethnically cleansed and dominated for fascism to continue existing. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5851.2s)]
*  And therefore, once you exterminate all of the enemies that you have designed as enemies of the state, you then move within and you make a smaller in group. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5860.2s)]
*  The example I will use is once the Nazis were done with their exterminationist project against like the disabled trans people, communist, socialist trade unionists, Jews, the Roma population, they eventually would have shifted to to a new design of the higher class of being the Aryan, the superior Aryan class, blonde and blue eyed Germans, as opposed to brown eyed Germans. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5871.2s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5901.2s)]
*  Like. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5902.2s)]
*  And before you say Hitler didn't have, you know, Hitler wasn't blonde and had blue eyes like it was. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5903.2s)]
*  It is an exterminationist policy, and it's also it doesn't matter if the leader is not the leader doesn't actually look the part. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5909.2s)]
*  OK, like they there has to be there has to be a there is never there is never enough death and destruction that will satisfy fascist policies. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5918.2s)]
*  There will never be enough death and destruction of the out group. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5931.2s)]
*  The out group must remain permanent in order to continue enforcing dominance to continue the fascist project. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5934.2s)]
*  This is why it is this is why it's inherently considered a suicidal ideology. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5942.2s)]
*  This is why fascism inevitably collapses. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5948.2s)]
*  So if you have a permanent loyalty pact with a fascist nation state that is doing an ethnic cleansing campaign and more and more people get upset about this exterminationist project because they keep seeing dead children on their social media timelines. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5951.2s)]
*  And they keep expressing their discontent with the governments that are aiding and abetting this project in the Western world. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5971.2s)]
*  You have two options. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5980.2s)]
*  Either you just say shut the fuck up. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5981.2s)]
*  No real democracy exists. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5983.2s)]
*  What are you going to do about it? [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5985.2s)]
*  We're just going to keep defending Israel. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5986.2s)]
*  Or you try to massage the narrative a little bit to try and decouple from Israel to say, oh, we are actually very critical of Israel. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5988.2s)]
*  As a matter of fact, we are responding to law. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=5997.2s)]
*  Okay. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6001.2s)]
*  Anti-Semite dude, I don't think you understand what you're saying when you associate Israel with with Judaism, especially at this stage. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6002.2s)]
*  I don't think you will ever understand what you're doing. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6010.2s)]
*  There is no monolithic international jury. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6012.2s)]
*  This is a real Nazi idea. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6016.2s)]
*  Okay. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6018.2s)]
*  That's number one. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6019.2s)]
*  Number two, claiming that I'm anti-Semitic because I'm saying that Israel is killing children and this has nothing to do with Judaism is idiotic because are you saying that? [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6021.2s)]
*  No, Israel's exterminationist project is actually for Judaism. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6030.2s)]
*  Like Jews have to kill children. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6035.2s)]
*  Is that what you're saying? [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6036.2s)]
*  Because unironically, you snap back to blood libel as a defensive mechanism that is infinitely more anti-Semitic than anyone. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6037.2s)]
*  That's the same shit that Nick Fuentes says. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6046.2s)]
*  When you defend Israel on the grounds that like this is when you defend Israel on the grounds that this is being conducted for Judaism, you unironically are saying like, no, Jews are monolithic, which is not true. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6049.2s)]
*  Okay. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6062.2s)]
*  And you're saying that all Jews that are monolithic as a force are totally invested in like the ethnic displacement of all Palestinians and is justifiable. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6063.2s)]
*  I would even go so far as to say that fascism isn't so much different death pack, but an extension of liberalism when the population frustration with the inherent death conclusion of liberalism is the Swiss system switches gears. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6072.2s)]
*  But you should not confuse what is going on in Gaza with fascism. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6081.2s)]
*  The Israeli government is a fascist entity. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6084.2s)]
*  Yes, but its operations are predominantly against a native population. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6086.2s)]
*  For now, inevitably, it will run out of this population and turn inwards. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6088.2s)]
*  Yes, that's yeah, I know. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6092.2s)]
*  It is it is a fascist ethno state that is doing a genocide. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6095.2s)]
*  And eventually they will turn the cross errors internally if they are able to complete their extermination as project. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6101.2s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6108.2s)]
*  Bargo. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6110.2s)]
*  If it doesn't stop literally what I'm saying, Gaza says the Spanish government, which is hosting a meeting in Madrid of Arab and European countries, including the UK on how to end the war. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6111.2s)]
*  Today, Israeli airstrikes killed 30 Palestinians while yesterday two members of the International Red Cross were killed. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6121.2s)]
*  Some limited aid of 107 trucks did enter Gaza. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6128.2s)]
*  But humanitarian organizations say that much more up to 600. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6132.2s)]
*  Do we all remember when is desperately needed following 11 weeks of a blockade on aid by Israel. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6136.2s)]
*  Fergal Keene reports now on the situation facing the youngest members of Gaza's population. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6143.2s)]
*  And there are distressing images. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6148.2s)]
*  We see it and we hear it from far away, but in sound and color, an agony that cannot be denied. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6154.2s)]
*  This is a salmon. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6168.2s)]
*  He is five years old. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6170.2s)]
*  Today, a British doctor captured these images in the pediatric ward of Nasser Hospital. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6172.2s)]
*  The young and vulnerable. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6178.2s)]
*  Really shocking. Skin and bone. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6181.2s)]
*  There was abundant aid that could have helped them. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6183.2s)]
*  But nearly three months of Israeli blockade kept it out of Gaza. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6186.2s)]
*  How they were once and how they are now. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6191.2s)]
*  These children are so malnourished that they're actually wasting away. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6195.2s)]
*  It's shocking to see this degree of malnutrition and it's because of the blockade. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6199.2s)]
*  The hunger ward, where a colleague first met five-month-old Siwaar Ashour. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6212.2s)]
*  Allergic to regular milk formula, the special variety she needed was running out under the blockade. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6220.2s)]
*  When I change her, her body is very bad and dehydrated. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6226.2s)]
*  She's like a skeleton. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6231.2s)]
*  Whenever I look at her, I cry. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6233.2s)]
*  I cannot bear how thin she is. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6236.2s)]
*  Her condition stabilized. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6246.2s)]
*  And a week ago, Siwaar was sent home from the busy hospital. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6249.2s)]
*  Israels on Twitter mocking this video of that baby and saying the mother is well fed. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6253.2s)]
*  Yeah, I don't want to see that. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6257.2s)]
*  I don't want to see the Israeli response to any of these things because it's fucking horrifying. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6259.2s)]
*  Also, these images are one-to-one. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6265.2s)]
*  The same exact images that you saw from concentration camps in the aftermath of the concentration camps being liberated. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6269.2s)]
*  Just so you understand, the difference, of course, is that this is a live streamed Holocaust. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6277.2s)]
*  Okay? [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6283.2s)]
*  That's it. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6285.2s)]
*  That's the only difference is that this is a Holocaust that is currently being live streamed. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6286.2s)]
*  So you get to see it in real time. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6291.2s)]
*  The situation is very dire. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6294.2s)]
*  We're staying in a tent and there are many insects. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6297.2s)]
*  The insects come at her. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6302.2s)]
*  I have to cover her with a scarf so nothing touches her. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6304.2s)]
*  Even though Israel is now allowing some aid into Gaza, there's nothing like enough nutrition for Siwaar. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6310.2s)]
*  Her mum says her weight has dropped again in recent days. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6316.2s)]
*  Currently, there is no food or nutrients. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6320.2s)]
*  The water is polluted. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6324.2s)]
*  Currently, there is no food or nutrients. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6326.2s)]
*  The water is polluted and we force ourselves to drink it. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6329.2s)]
*  We don't have food or bread. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6333.2s)]
*  The shelter was hit by gunfire when people attempted to loot food nearby. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6339.2s)]
*  When Siwaar hears the sounds of the rockets, she gets startled and she cries. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6347.2s)]
*  She understands these things. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6352.2s)]
*  The sound of the tanks, warplanes and rockets are so loud and they are close to us. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6355.2s)]
*  And if she was sleeping, she would wake up startled and crying. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6361.2s)]
*  The Israeli government said three days ago there was no food crisis in Gaza. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6369.2s)]
*  But that it was now allowing aid to prevent one. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6376.2s)]
*  Life is hunger, fear and trauma. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6381.2s)]
*  Dr. Wasim Said is a British plastic surgeon who's just returned from Gaza. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6394.2s)]
*  He's treated many children like six-year-old Noor, who suffered severe blast and burn injuries in an Israeli airstrike. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6401.2s)]
*  Lack of nutrition is making it much harder for wounds to heal, he says. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6409.2s)]
*  You could see people losing hope. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6414.2s)]
*  You could see how depressed they were. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6417.2s)]
*  The nutritional status of everybody was appalling. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6419.2s)]
*  So grafts were not taking, wounds were not healing. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6423.2s)]
*  Yet for all that he's seen, this British doctor wants to go back. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6430.2s)]
*  It's his human duty, he told us. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6435.2s)]
*  None of this needed to happen. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6438.2s)]
*  Every time you see a child you think of your own children and how it, well, you try not to at the time because it would be untrue. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6440.2s)]
*  You couldn't work if you thought, what if this was happened to my daughter or heaven forbid or something like that. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6451.2s)]
*  Set against the raging war, a child's life is a fragile thing. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6458.2s)]
*  Clearly, from one heartbeat to the next. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6463.2s)]
*  Ferdil Keene, BBC News. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6469.2s)]
*  Well, Israel does not allow international media organisations, including the BBC, into Gaza and we use trusted freelance teams on the ground. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6474.2s)]
*  Let's turn now to our correspondent, Barbara Pletasha, who's in Jerusalem for us. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6483.2s)]
*  And Barbara, some terrible scenes of suffering there. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6488.2s)]
*  We know that some aid has gone. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6491.2s)]
*  It's important not to look away from this because this is the death and destruction that our governments, whether you're in the UK or whether you're in the United States of America, [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6493.2s)]
*  this is the death and destruction that our governments are contributing to in very meaningful ways. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6505.2s)]
*  OK, whether it be directly giving the bombs to use that end up scarring those children permanently while killing their entire families, [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6510.2s)]
*  or whether it be offering the surveillance and targeting of areas to hit that the British government is doing. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6519.2s)]
*  We are morally culpable. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6530.2s)]
*  The largest moral responsibility still falls in the hands of the United States of America that has offered political cover and also 70% of all the munitions that are being used in the Gaza Strip. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6532.2s)]
*  We are morally culpable. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6544.2s)]
*  We are morally culpable. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6546.2s)]
*  We are morally culpable. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6548.2s)]
*  But it's important for you to see this, and it's important for you to show this to other people to help them understand our complicity and to help them understand the humanity of the Palestinians. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6550.2s)]
*  There is a reason why Israel kills journalists. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6573.2s)]
*  There is a reason why Israel does not want Western media to enter the Strip because Israel does not want international investigators to document these atrocities. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6576.2s)]
*  OK, that's it. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6587.2s)]
*  That's it. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6590.2s)]
*  Because if Western media were to enter the Strip, if international investigators were to conduct investigations in the Gaza Strip to give a better assessment on the full scale of these atrocities, [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6591.2s)]
*  the world, like it would be completely impossible for Israel to deny anything at that point. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6608.2s)]
*  The only plausible deniability that Israel can entertain at this moment is the Islamophobia that is a permanent fixture in Western political discourse in Western collective consciousness. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6617.2s)]
*  Do you understand? [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6633.2s)]
*  That way they can just say Hamas run health care ministry. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6634.2s)]
*  But once it's no longer Hamas run health care ministry, once it's the United Nations and every single non-government organization that's operating in the area, every single international investigator, all of a sudden you can't say, well, they're also Hamas. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6637.2s)]
*  Think about it this way. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6653.2s)]
*  When Israel says Hamas run as Hamas run health care, Hamas run. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6655.2s)]
*  Hold on one second. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6663.2s)]
*  Hold on. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6665.2s)]
*  I got to do this. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6666.2s)]
*  OK. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6667.2s)]
*  When Israel says Hamas run Ministry of Health and the American media repeats that state, that is no matter how woke someone might be that causes them to be skeptical. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6668.2s)]
*  But when Israel says UN is Hamas, everybody laughs at that. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6680.2s)]
*  OK. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6683.2s)]
*  Unless you are literally the most insane Israel Dickrider that believes that OK, that already is completely lapping up all the fucking propaganda. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6684.2s)]
*  Most people laugh at this notion. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6696.2s)]
*  What the fuck? [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6699.2s)]
*  Got in. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6700.2s)]
*  Are we likely to see any improvement soon? [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6701.2s)]
*  Well, Israel says it has allowed around 500 lorries carrying food supplies into Gaza over the past week. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6703.2s)]
*  And some of that has been distributed, but there's been a lot of chaos and insecurity. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6712.2s)]
*  Desperate people overwhelming bread bakeries, for example, and armed men looting some of the aid. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6717.2s)]
*  UN officials say that that's because so little has been let in. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6722.2s)]
*  They say this wasn't a problem during the ceasefire when Gaza was flooded with aid, and that needs to happen again. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6726.2s)]
*  But Israel is saying, no, it's going to try something new. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6732.2s)]
*  It's going to use a private company backed by the US to distribute food and arguing that this is going to prevent Hamas from stealing aid and so reduce its influence. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6735.2s)]
*  But there's a lot of criticism about this plan, not least because this company doesn't have the supplies and the structures that the UN has. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6744.2s)]
*  And so at best, at the moment, it could only feed about half the population. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6752.2s)]
*  And then at the same time, you've had this escalation in the war by Israel saying that it wants to finish Hamas off. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6756.2s)]
*  You had the chief of staff today telling soldiers, in fact, Hamas has been greatly weakened. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6763.2s)]
*  This is not going to be an endless war. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6768.2s)]
*  But it really doesn't look like that in Gaza right now, I have to say. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6771.2s)]
*  There are people are being squeezed into a smaller and smaller space, and there have been many civilians killed during military operations over the weekend. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6776.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6784.2s)]
*  Barbara Pletasha reporting there. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6785.2s)]
*  Genocide. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6789.2s)]
*  Most media outlets in the West, even now, even as Israel continues to proudly flatten Gaza and starve the Palestinians of Gaza, refuse to use the term genocide. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6790.2s)]
*  Joe Biden last year went out of his way to say what's happening in Gaza is not genocide. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6800.2s)]
*  Kirstama refuses to say it is. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6805.2s)]
*  And pro-Israel groups often accuse anyone who says Gaza is a genocide of perpetrating an anti-Semitic blood libel. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6807.2s)]
*  And yet here's the thing they don't want you to know. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6814.2s)]
*  Genocide experts are almost all in agreement that what's happening is a genocide. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6817.2s)]
*  Per the legal definition under the Genocide Convention, acts committed with the intent to destroy in whole or in part a national, ethnic, racial or religious group. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6823.2s)]
*  So here are the names, the expert names you need to know, including Jewish and. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6832.2s)]
*  Dude, by the way, the counter to this was so funny. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6836.2s)]
*  The the Hosborough counters to this was just like to bring up a bunch of like generals and former like random generals and former American members of like the State Department to be like, well, these are genocide experts too. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6839.2s)]
*  It's like, no, they're not. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6856.2s)]
*  They're not. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6857.2s)]
*  They're not. You're just claiming that they're genocide experts like you're you can't say like Alan Dershowitz doesn't consider it a genocide and then and then make it seem as though Alan Dershowitz is a fucking expert of genocide. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6858.2s)]
*  It is so fucking stupid. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6872.2s)]
*  Yeah, I'm wrong. I know. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6874.2s)]
*  Yeah. The joke is, yes, Alan Dershowitz and and American generals are experts in doing a genocide. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6876.2s)]
*  But their opinion is not necessarily worth a damn in this process, don't you think? [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6884.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's like asking the fucking Nazi generals whether or not what yeah, Adolf Eichmann genocide expert, you know, Israeli experts on the subject of genocide to avoid being gaslit by apologists for Israel. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6893.2s)]
*  First, there are the academic experts who say Gaza is a genocide. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6909.2s)]
*  Martin Shaw, who literally wrote the book What is Genocide? [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6913.2s)]
*  Melanie O'Brien, who is the literal president of the International Association of Genocide Scholars. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6916.2s)]
*  Dirk Moses, who is the senior editor of the Journal of Genocide Research. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6922.2s)]
*  Eva Vukucic, who helped prosecute the Shrevebronichet genocide. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6927.2s)]
*  William Shabas, who even defended Myanmar against charges of genocide, against the Rohingya, but says what Israel is doing in Gaza now is a genocide. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6931.2s)]
*  There are also the Israeli genocide experts. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6941.2s)]
*  The Israeli historians of the Holocaust is a genocide. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6944.2s)]
*  Professors Omar Batov, Amos Goldberg, Daniel Blatman, Raz Siegel, Lee Mordecai, Dr. Shmuel Lederman, who was originally opposed to calling Gaza a genocide, [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6947.2s)]
*  but now says, quote, What Israel is doing in Gaza is genocidal in every sense. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6959.2s)]
*  Then there are the human rights groups who say Gaza is a genocide. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6964.2s)]
*  Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the legal clinics at top US universities who say it's a genocide, [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6967.2s)]
*  at Boston University School of Law, at Cornell Law School, at Yale Law School, [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6974.2s)]
*  the United Nations organizations and experts who say it's a genocide, [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6979.2s)]
*  the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry, [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6982.2s)]
*  the UN Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices, multiple UN special rapporteurs. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6985.2s)]
*  In fact, speaking the other week to the Dutch newspaper NRC, the Israeli expert Raz Siegel said, [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6990.2s)]
*  Can I name someone whose work I respect who doesn't consider it genocide? His answer, no. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=6996.2s)]
*  The Israeli expert Shmuel Lederman says it's now the consensus view among genocide researchers. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=7003.2s)]
*  So apologists for Israel and lazy and cowardly both sides media outlets [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=7010.2s)]
*  might want to reject the charge of genocide in Gaza. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=7015.2s)]
*  They might want to pretend it's hyperbole or even anti-Semitic. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=7018.2s)]
*  But the experts, the actual experts on genocide, they know a genocide when they see one. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=7021.2s)]
*  And they see one in Gaza. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=7028.2s)]
*  It's just not serious at all. All right. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=7039.2s)]
*  There's also another story. An American charged with plotting the bomb at US office, [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=7049.2s)]
*  US embassy office in Israel, which is a crazy story. I'm going to get to the, I'm going to get to the, the, the, oh yeah. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=7053.2s)]
*  This is a Fox News is fucking covering it because Trey Yankst is covering it. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=7063.2s)]
*  Hold on. I got to pee first though. So I'm just going to, I'm just going to play the. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqm6vgW9DY&t=7068.2s)]
