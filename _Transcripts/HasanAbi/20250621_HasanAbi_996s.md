# Why is America Getting Involved in Another Foreign War? | HasanAbi Reacts to Theo Von
**HasanAbi:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI)
*  with through an international tribunal. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=0.0s)]
*  Where there on October 7, absolutely [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=4.8s)]
*  fucking literally. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=6.04s)]
*  OK, but the amount of committed on October 7 [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=6.96s)]
*  pales in comparison. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  Pales in comparison to the metric ton. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  Of that, Israel is committed before October 7 [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=18.8s)]
*  and after October 7. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=21.64s)]
*  Well, let's just start with Iran or Iran. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=23.16s)]
*  People say it differently, but do you think [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=30.16s)]
*  what's going on? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=32.0s)]
*  I'm really concerned. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  I'm fearful. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=34.72s)]
*  We have a possibility where we're going to [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=37.04s)]
*  blunder into another war in the Middle East. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=40.760000000000005s)]
*  And just today, actually, to make some news, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=43.92s)]
*  Thomas Massey, who is a principled Republican [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=46.0s)]
*  and myself introduced a powers resolution [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  saying that the president should not get into [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=52.599999999999994s)]
*  a war with Iran without coming to Congress. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=56.08s)]
*  You know, the president, to his credit, ran [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=60.4s)]
*  against the war in Iraq. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=62.4s)]
*  He ran saying, I don't want any wars. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=63.599999999999994s)]
*  And the reality is that if we strike Iran, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  they start hitting us back and hitting our troops [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=70.6s)]
*  in the Middle East, terrorist activity. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=73.52s)]
*  That's going to cost this country a lot of money [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=76.0s)]
*  that should be being spent here at home. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=78.36s)]
*  It's going to mean people could die who are [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=80.64s)]
*  serving the country. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=83.16s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=83.96s)]
*  Well, let's look at this. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=84.75999999999999s)]
*  But the bill you guys were thinking about. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=85.88s)]
*  What is it called? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=87.39999999999999s)]
*  It's called the power's resolution to stop a [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=88.32s)]
*  war, which basically says before the president [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=91.32s)]
*  does anything to go into war with Iran, he's [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=94.0s)]
*  got to get a vote in Congress. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=96.6s)]
*  And how long does that take, though? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=98.88s)]
*  Like usually to get a vote in Congress? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=100.36s)]
*  Is there a certain period of time? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=102.0s)]
*  Can they do it in 24 hours? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=103.0s)]
*  It takes weeks or what? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=104.16s)]
*  They could. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  It's the decision of the speaker of the House [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=105.36s)]
*  to when he can bring it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=107.12s)]
*  He has to bring it within 15 days. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=108.12s)]
*  But what we want is today. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=110.44000000000001s)]
*  But by the way, you know, there are a lot of [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=112.44000000000001s)]
*  Trump supporters who are telling him, don't go [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=113.56s)]
*  into this war. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=116.44000000000001s)]
*  Tucker Carlson, Marjorie Taylor Greene. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=117.88000000000001s)]
*  Oh, Dave Smith was talking about it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=121.04s)]
*  He's a political. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=122.68s)]
*  He's a comedian who also talks a lot about [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=123.88000000000001s)]
*  politics, you know. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=125.52000000000001s)]
*  Oh, I think this is a horrible idea. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=126.92s)]
*  You know, and yeah, people say, well, you don't [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  know a ton about the Middle East. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=131.08s)]
*  I'm like, that's fine. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=131.96s)]
*  I don't want people I know, my friends getting [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=132.8s)]
*  called up. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=137.16s)]
*  I don't want the children of my friends getting [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=137.64s)]
*  called over to die. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=140.48s)]
*  I don't even understand how it's an option. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=141.84s)]
*  The only reason I even kind of want it to be [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=145.24s)]
*  possible is to give is that if Israel like goes [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=148.44s)]
*  to war with Iran, then it'll at least stop [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=152.56s)]
*  killing Palestinian people for a day or two. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=155.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=157.64s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=157.84s)]
*  Like that's like my own. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=158.28s)]
*  It's like at least point the guns that way, you [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=159.4s)]
*  know, kind of that's where some of my thoughts [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=162.0s)]
*  are. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=163.44s)]
*  Look, you've been such a courageous voice on [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=163.84s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=166.48000000000002s)]
*  I mean, you look at what's going on there, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=167.6s)]
*  right? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  50. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=170.28s)]
*  Do they actually do conscription in the U.S.? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=171.16s)]
*  I mean, yeah, they did. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=172.84s)]
*  They did a draft, but given the lack of appetite [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=174.88s)]
*  for going to war and the military manpower [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=178.24s)]
*  necessary, I could totally see it because our [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=183.4s)]
*  numbers, like our military's, the military has [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=189.36s)]
*  a amount that they need to hit in terms of new [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=193.48000000000002s)]
*  enlistment and enlistments have been pretty low [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=198.16000000000003s)]
*  for like the tail end of the war on terror. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=201.8s)]
*  And the enlistment numbers actually went up a lot [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=206.12s)]
*  because of 9-11. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=209.72000000000003s)]
*  While the military can still serve as a [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=211.08s)]
*  domineering force all around the world with the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=213.36s)]
*  poverty draft that it has, you still need so [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=217.20000000000002s)]
*  many more troops. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=221.79999999999998s)]
*  And in the absence of some 9-11 style situation [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=223.2s)]
*  that creates an incredible amount of patriotism. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=226.44s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=231.16s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=232.32s)]
*  Take a day off, dude. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=233.28s)]
*  Stop sending me the same link over and over [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=234.44s)]
*  again. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=236.04s)]

*  we should come out like it feels like America is [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=396.44s)]

*  We saved the world from Nazism. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=407.68s)]

*  away from what they've done in the past. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=417.40000000000003s)]
*  No, no, it quite literally does. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=419.04s)]
*  It quite literally does. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=422.52000000000004s)]
*  You're actually completely wrong about this. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=424.08s)]
*  OK, during October seven, during October seven [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=427.24s)]
*  with through an international tribunal. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=431.0s)]
*  Where they're on October seven, absolutely [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=435.72s)]
*  fucking literally. OK. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=437.0s)]
*  But the amount of committed on October seven [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=439.0s)]
*  pales in comparison. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=443.0s)]
*  Pales in comparison to the metric ton. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=446.12s)]
*  Of that, Israel is committed before October seven [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=449.76s)]
*  and after October seven. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=452.59999999999997s)]
*  Don't get reset. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=454.15999999999997s)]
*  Don't get reset after a certain period. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=455.08s)]
*  No, you're misunderstanding what I'm saying. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=456.52s)]
*  An international tribunal that would accurately assess [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=459.56s)]
*  who was responsible for any on October seven [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=463.08s)]
*  and also all of the post October seven, which are so [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=466.64s)]
*  which are so vast, it would be virtually impossible [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=470.44s)]
*  to accurately make an assessment there. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=473.76s)]
*  OK, and even before October seven, like the [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=477.52000000000004s)]
*  Israel is engaged in. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=480.0s)]
*  Like the crime of an apartheid state. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=482.08000000000004s)]
*  Even the acts of resistance historically [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=487.88000000000005s)]
*  are usually matched against [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=491.48s)]
*  what the the true responsible party, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=494.8s)]
*  the settler colonial occupying party has done. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=498.04s)]
*  This is why, while there are some criminal penalties [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=503.0s)]
*  that are given to people who have resistance [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=507.32s)]
*  against violent criminal occupation, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=509.8s)]
*  they are limited in terms of the amount of crimes, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=514.84s)]
*  the the the actual that are supposed to be [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=518.4s)]
*  the actual war crime litigation against the occupational force. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=523.52s)]
*  Good guys in the Cold War, we stood up the Soviet Union. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=527.84s)]
*  People want to think that we are the good guys. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=532.0s)]
*  Why are we helping Netanyahu [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=534.68s)]
*  in the killing of children, women [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=538.8s)]
*  and so many Palestinian civilians? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=542.64s)]
*  Now, look, Israel was hard hit October 7th. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=545.16s)]
*  I'm sure like that was horrific. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=548.56s)]
*  The October 7th attack. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=551.36s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=553.16s)]
*  And neither of us have any sympathy for Hamas. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=553.96s)]
*  They're a terrorist group. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=557.88s)]
*  But what happened is I supported initially Israel [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=559.64s)]
*  saying, go get those terrorists who committed those horrific attacks on October 7th. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=562.76s)]
*  But by within three months, they had destroyed a lot of Hamas. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=567.5600000000001s)]
*  What now is happening over two years later, they're still going in bombing [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=573.24s)]
*  and they're bombing because Ben Gavir and Smotlich, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=578.8000000000001s)]
*  two of the people in Netanyahu's cabinet, are saying, don't stop the war, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=583.48s)]
*  even though they know that they can't. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=588.04s)]
*  This assessment is so this is so juvenile. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=590.16s)]
*  And I can't believe this is like one of the most like radical positions [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=593.8399999999999s)]
*  that a sitting congressperson could take right now. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=599.0799999999999s)]
*  It's crazy. Like, oh, yeah, it's it's a Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gavir. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=602.4799999999999s)]
*  That's really pushing Netanyahu to to punish Gaza. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=607.7199999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah, that's the reason you can't bomb and eradicate Hamas. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=612.76s)]
*  They haven't been able to do it. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=617.48s)]
*  And what's the only thing that's happening is that civilians are getting killed [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=619.44s)]
*  and Israel actually is becoming less popular in that region. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=625.16s)]
*  I mean, I was in Saudi Arabia and Jordan. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=629.4s)]
*  They're losing support. Yeah. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=631.88s)]
*  So why is Netanyahu trying to drag us into it? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=634.04s)]
*  What do you think that relationship is like between him and Donald Trump? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=637.5600000000001s)]
*  So I think Donald Trump actually initially stood up to Netanyahu [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=641.32s)]
*  because he wanted to bring this war to a close [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=644.76s)]
*  and he didn't want to get dragged in initially to a war in Iran. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=648.4399999999999s)]
*  I mean, you know what Trump's courage was while he became president in 2016? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=651.96s)]
*  Do you remember the Republican stage and they all asked, are you for the Iraq war? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=656.48s)]
*  And Jeb Bush, who was George Bush's brother, wasn't willing to say [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=661.2s)]
*  that his brother made a mistake. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=664.3199999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah, he's a little oil bunny. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=666.04s)]
*  You know, and Donald Trump, to his credit, stood up on a Republican stage [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=667.56s)]
*  and said the Iraq war was a disaster. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=672.76s)]
*  I think that's how he became president. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=675.16s)]
*  And he ran saying, I want to be a president who ends these wars. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=676.76s)]
*  I really believe that's what he thought at the time. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=680.8s)]
*  Oh, well, sure. Well, I think recently, you know, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=684.72s)]
*  how we're doing OK without the note so far, huh? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=687.84s)]
*  You're doing great. OK. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=689.8s)]
*  I wish I wish people had more common sense [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=691.0799999999999s)]
*  like you than the people who are making this foreign policy stuff. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=693.84s)]
*  So actually, my recommendation is that before Donald Trump makes a decision, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=696.92s)]
*  he needs to have a conversation with you. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=700.48s)]
*  Oh, God. No. Well, to remind him, because I, you know, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=702.12s)]
*  I watched your actually clip with him during the presidential campaign. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=705.2s)]
*  And I said, you made him the most human that I've actually seen him. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=708.8000000000001s)]
*  I mean, your conversation with him about his brother and alcoholism. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=713.6s)]
*  And then he asks you, what is it? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=717.8000000000001s)]
*  What was it like for you to have cocaine and your addiction? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=719.6800000000001s)]
*  And I thought, well, this is like him. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=722.2s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. I think Ro Khanna's team got that for me. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=724.0s)]
*  That was my bar bar for bar. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=727.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm having a normal kind. No, they watch. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=730.2s)]
*  And if you're watching right now, Ro Khanna's team. OK. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=732.5200000000001s)]
*  If we're going to give him some talking points, give him some better talking points. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=736.1600000000001s)]
*  Stop with this like Hamas terrorism. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=739.5200000000001s)]
*  They're destroying Hamas terrorism or it's more bank. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=741.5600000000001s)]
*  You're is actually pushing them to do this, pushing any out to do this. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=743.88s)]
*  That's not the truth. OK. Come on. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=747.08s)]
*  Conversation. Yeah, felt pretty normal. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=750.0s)]
*  And so, you know, but I think, do you know anyone there in your life [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=752.0400000000001s)]
*  who's like, yeah, we should go out and go, go to the DNC? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=756.72s)]
*  Yes. I've also interviewed him at the Bernie rally as well with Iran. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=760.04s)]
*  Like any of the no, the folks you know, nobody, nobody, even like, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=764.7199999999999s)]
*  even like hardhead, you know, like even guys who like Navy, former Navy. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=768.56s)]
*  No, none of them. Nobody is saying yes. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=774.52s)]
*  And I felt like the biggest thing that's I mean, there's so many things right now. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=777.36s)]
*  And they do not know who you are, little bro. OK. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=782.56s)]
*  Like that, I feel like. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=786.68s)]
*  In the world that are kind of stressing people and making people nervous. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=789.2399999999999s)]
*  But one of the things is I felt like it was supposed to be America first, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=793.16s)]
*  like we're focusing on like, what are we doing to get things back into America? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=795.76s)]
*  Right. Like increase, like the purpose of being an American to refill [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=799.7199999999999s)]
*  like our hearts with blood and like and and and and make us feel something again here [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=804.52s)]
*  and make us be excited about being an American. Right. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=810.28s)]
*  And I felt like that was what a lot of the energy was for. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=813.2s)]
*  And then now that we're caught up here and it feels like we are just working for Israel. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=817.4399999999999s)]
*  I think to a lot of people, it's I don't know. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=823.96s)]
*  You just really start to feel very disillusioned pretty quickly. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=827.08s)]
*  Also, Rokana literally defended what Israel was doing at the DNC nearly a year [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=831.68s)]
*  since 10, 7. So there's two month narrative that he's talking about right now. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=835.88s)]
*  Such bullshit. And I expect nothing less from Rokana. Yeah. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=838.48s)]
*  I mean, I talked to him directly. I was like, Israel's doing a genocide. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=841.8000000000001s)]
*  He's like, well, I wouldn't. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=844.2s)]
*  He's like, oh, I wouldn't say that. I wouldn't use those. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=846.44s)]
*  I was like, well, I would, because that's what is going on. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=848.6s)]
*  And many human rights groups would also use that term. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=851.24s)]
*  And and I don't mean disillusioned in people. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=856.08s)]
*  I don't mean disillusioned in like the human beings, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=858.12s)]
*  but this disillusioned in our leaders. Right. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=861.24s)]
*  You start to feel like, I don't know, at one point, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=863.96s)]
*  neither one of these parties is helping us. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=867.0400000000001s)]
*  Well, they both seem like parties that have gotten us into war. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=869.6s)]
*  I mean, six trillion dollars it cost us into Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=873.4399999999999s)]
*  And we need now an antiwar movement in this country. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=878.16s)]
*  And I don't think it has to be Democrat or Republican. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=882.24s)]
*  I think Americans are sick of war. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=884.76s)]
*  And thank you, man, for talking about this stuff with me, man. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=887.16s)]
*  It even helps us like one thing I noticed, even we spoke on the phone [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=889.68s)]
*  the other night, man, and it just like after I got on the phone with you, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=892.4399999999999s)]
*  I felt a little better. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=895.48s)]
*  I was like, at least I have somebody to talk about this with. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=896.72s)]
*  Dude, yesterday I'm leaving this restaurant and a guy comes up to me. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=899.76s)]
*  He's missing a tooth or he's he was missing one. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=903.4399999999999s)]
*  And he was like, hey, man, thanks for speaking up about Palestine stuff. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=906.72s)]
*  And I was like, I said, well, I don't honestly I don't know a ton about it. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=911.28s)]
*  It's just kind of how I feel. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=914.24s)]
*  And he goes, well, I think a lot of people are just afraid to speak up. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=915.52s)]
*  They're afraid if they speak against Israel, that they're going to be labeled [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=918.72s)]
*  an anti-Semite. And I was like, oh, no, I said, I understand that. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=921.4399999999999s)]
*  But I think that's just a verbal trap. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=926.1999999999999s)]
*  You know, I'd said you can have like I have tons of Jewish friends [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=927.96s)]
*  that I talk to every day. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=932.24s)]
*  And and I don't think what yet in Yahoo is doing is good. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=933.24s)]
*  But anyway, don't undersell yourself. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=936.6s)]
*  You have more common sense and your values than 90 percent of the foreign policy [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=938.5600000000001s)]
*  blob that has gotten us into all these wars and that has compromised humanity. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=943.84s)]
*  There's a reason the founders wanted Congress to be making decisions [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=948.84s)]
*  about war and peace. They trusted the American people. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=953.2800000000001s)]
*  Right. Like the kings of the past, when the founders were there, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=955.76s)]
*  they would just do wars for their own glory. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=959.16s)]
*  And the American people were really the founders were really suspicious of that. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=961.68s)]
*  And so they said, you know what, we actually trust the farmers [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=965.52s)]
*  and the people in factories and ordinary Americans not to get us into all this stuff. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=968.96s)]
*  And they trusted people like you, Theo. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=974.4s)]
*  And the problem is that your voice has gotten out of Washington [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=976.96s)]
*  and not central to it. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=981.4s)]
*  But now we've got all these podcasts and they can't ignore you. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=983.68s)]
*  Yeah. Good for you to try to take back citizen voices. That's what. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY6V2kD04yI&t=986.76s)]
