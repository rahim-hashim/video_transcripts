# Trump vs Harris 2024 - Middle Ground | Hasanabi Reacts to Jubilee
**HasanAbi:** [September 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY)
*  Like what is happening dude? Then Trump is not representative of the Republican Party. He's just a small bean TV guy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=0.0s)]
*  You know? What the- Who can I use as an example if not that guy? He is literally THE guy. That's crazy man. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=5.84s)]
*  Harris middle ground? Why do y'all want me to watch this bro? Oh, Hasan Abed head in the building. Okay. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=18.88s)]
*  Third world is offensive to me bro. Because you're talking about a- [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=23.92s)]
*  Did Keija reach out to you about Kaleigh of Williams before the execution? No. Subhuman. No, it's not that it's a subhuman. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=28.08s)]
*  You're talking about people who aren't as developed as we are so they're the third world. So if you're stoning women after they've been- [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=35.28s)]
*  In the Bible bro, not now. Hold up, let me- No, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  Damn dog, he got it. There's a big- There's a big epidemic of Haitian stoning women after they got- [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=44.4s)]
*  Or Venezuelans or whatever this guy's argument is. That's cool. I did VIP Mason yet. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=52.16s)]
*  From Iran and it happens now. Another day, another episode of middle ground. Hi, my name is John. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=57.68s)]
*  I am the host of Radical Empathy and I will be moderating today's episode between Harris supporters and Trump supporters. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=63.12s)]
*  Our first prompt is- The video is loud, I know. It's like much louder than me. I don't know why. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=70.56s)]
*  No matter what my candidate does, I will still vote for them. I mean I'd be lying if I said if Trump came out [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=74.64s)]
*  in a crowd and just started, you know, yelling at people, calling them stupid or like did something [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=81.92s)]
*  crazy that I wouldn't still vote for him. It would have to be like walk out in Times Square, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=87.36s)]
*  shoot someone in the face kind of thing. Like it would have to be something outrageous for me to not [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  vote for him right now and that is only because these are the only two choices I have, which sucks [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  for us as American people. We should have a lot more choice than this. We should have had more debates. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=102.64s)]
*  We should have had more people involved in the debates. It would just, it would take a lot for me [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=107.36s)]
*  not to vote for him just because I care so much about securing our country and my right to own firearms. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=111.28s)]
*  So for me, we know Kamala's character and so even thinking if she does the worst thing ever, would I [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  still vote for her? Yeah, because I know the worst thing that she could do wouldn't even be the best [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=123.6s)]
*  thing that Trump does, right? Like she, the bars are very different. In addition to that, of course [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=127.76s)]
*  I'm going to vote for her because Trump is such a terrible alternative. I'm afraid to see what our [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=132.8s)]
*  country would look like. I'm voting for Kamala for pragmatic reasons. January 6th made Trump [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=136.88s)]
*  ineligible in my eyes. He's a traitor. He disrupted 200 years of peaceful transfer of power [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=143.68s)]
*  for his own selfish reasons that he lost by a whisker sarcastically, according to him. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  Let's bring in our disagreeers. People that get like really upset at Donald Trump for January 6th [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=158.4s)]
*  are so funny to me. It's like our entire system is fundamentally broken, dude. Like it's like, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=164.72s)]
*  I'm sorry. Out of all the things that Donald Trump did, okay. Out of all the things that [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=170.4s)]
*  Donald Trump did awful, okay. Senseless deregulation. So aggressive that like even certain big oil [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=175.6s)]
*  participants had to be like, all right, dude, we're actually up the bag a little too much [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=184.4s)]
*  and insane tax cuts for the mega wealthy and corporations for absolutely zero reason at the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=188.56s)]
*  time for record high profits, like completely up the pandemic response that led to the deaths of [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=194.16s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of Americans. Like there's so many things that you could point to that. Like, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=201.68s)]
*  I'm sorry, January 6th does not even reach the top five. Okay. Like the intensity in which people [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=207.84s)]
*  talk about January 6th or like Donald Trump's desperate attempts at trying to in the stupidest [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=215.2s)]
*  way possible overturn the results of an election is hilarious to me. It's like, dude, this country [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=221.76s)]
*  sucks. Okay. It sucks. It sucks. We're not doing, we don't have healthcare. We barely have any sort [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=228.79999999999998s)]
*  of financial help for people that are suffering. And you're over, we're giving unlimited dollars to, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=236.64s)]
*  you know, there's all across the globe. We spend way much time, way more time, effort and emphasis [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=243.12s)]
*  on like maintaining America's global posture, which is death and destruction. And you're over [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=248.56s)]
*  here, no gun control, abortion rights have been taken away. And you're over here being like, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=254.96s)]
*  man, that January 6th thing, it's like really mad. It makes me so mad. He tried to steal the election. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=260.8s)]
*  It's like, bro, the system is collapsing in front of your eyes. And you're most frustrated about that. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=265.28s)]
*  Come on, dude. I'll go first again, like one of these two people are getting in right now. My [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=271.2s)]
*  choice is Kamala Harris. That doesn't mean that anything that she does is going to keep that [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=276.4s)]
*  support. My biggest issue right now is the going on in Gaza propagated by both the Trump administration [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=280.15999999999997s)]
*  and the Biden administration. You could say that prior to October 7th, there was peace going on [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=286.23999999999995s)]
*  between Israel and Gaza. As I've heard a lot of Trump supporters say, that's just factually [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=290.47999999999996s)]
*  inaccurate, especially with the Abraham Accords, especially with moving the embassy to Jerusalem. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=293.84s)]
*  These are things that I'm very critical of Trump on, and I'm still having trouble announcing my [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=298.08s)]
*  support for Kamala Harris. It was a big moral decision to even come on the show in support of [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=302.88s)]
*  her. But that's because I don't support her again. I think that Donald Trump is going to be somebody [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=307.6s)]
*  that's far worse for the country than she will be. So did you know that this is the lowest civilian to [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=311.6s)]
*  combatant death rate of any war in recent history? Did you know that? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=319.52s)]
*  Is this going to be a Gaza topic? I'm so ready to go on Gaza. I'm so ready. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=324.88s)]
*  Because I can't just let your word go because it's not, if it was, it would have ended [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=328.56s)]
*  two days later and it would have been fine. Everyone would be dead. So it's not it though. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=332.64s)]
*  Yeah, this is not a good argument, man. When the will psychopathic Israel defenders understand [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=336.64s)]
*  that being like, if they wanted to, they could even more people. Oh, okay. Got it. Sick. That's [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=342.24s)]
*  what we're doing. That's what we are looking at the morality of a situation over. Okay. Your honor, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=347.84s)]
*  I know I 40 families. Okay. But if I wanted to, I could have a hundred families. Guess what? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=355.6s)]
*  Calling me a serial in this situation is bad faith. Bad faith. I tell you I could have a lot more [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=362.72s)]
*  and I only chose the 40 families. Okay. How dare you, your honor. I say bad faith. I say [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=369.44s)]
*  that's not an argument. Shut up. It's also stupid because like, okay, it 12 million, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=377.68s)]
*  11 million total people. I think that's the full number. Six million Jews. There were six million [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=384.8s)]
*  other Jews. So I guess that's not, is an insane argument. If you made that argument, I'd be like, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=390.0s)]
*  you're a Holocaust denier. Okay. So what do you mean? And it's not like he did it in one day. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=393.68s)]
*  That's fine. But I want to hear, going back to the prompt, you came in because you disagreed. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=399.52000000000004s)]
*  There's, yeah, you wouldn't vote for Trump unconditionally. No, no, of course. I mean, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=403.92s)]
*  I think as a moral human being that comes from a place of love with strong core values, I can't [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=407.2s)]
*  just give anyone carte blanche that no matter what you do, you're going to have my love and support. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=413.04s)]
*  But from, you know, barring anything crazy, like the situation that Joe mentioned, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=418.16s)]
*  it's pretty much a hundred percent. And actually I am part of Jewish Voices for Trump and I really [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=424.8s)]
*  appreciate all of the people. I'm a part of Jewish Voices for Trump. I was at the seminar that he [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=429.20000000000005s)]
*  gave on where he was like, what the is wrong with you Jews? I gave you everything about Israel. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=436.96000000000004s)]
*  That's all you care about. Everybody knows that Jews have like a bone in their brain [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=441.52s)]
*  that causes them only to care about Israel and nothing else. Why the are only 40% of you voting [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=445.68s)]
*  for me. And I loved it. As a part of the Jewish Voices for Trump, I loved when he said that. He [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=450.56s)]
*  is so right to say that. Things that he's done for the Jewish people and for the state of Israel. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=457.68s)]
*  What has he done? Okay. For the state of Israel. Yes. What has he done for the Jewish people? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=462.0s)]
*  A Trump supporter went into a synagogue in Pennsylvania and 13 Jews. Okay. He was a Trump [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=467.36s)]
*  supporter who had now decided he was outflanking Trump. He was like still operating on Trumpian [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=476.72s)]
*  attitudes, by the way. He was like unlimited immigration. Jews are causing this. And honestly, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=482.32s)]
*  I hate it. And Donald Trump is not doing enough about it. So I'm going to take matters of our [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=487.12s)]
*  hands. That's what he said. We know that's what he said because he wrote about it on Gab, which is [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=491.04s)]
*  still a website that functions. I don't know how, which is Gab. For those of you who don't [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=495.2s)]
*  remember is basically what Twitter is now. But it was, you know, back then Twitter was too liberal. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=500.15999999999997s)]
*  So they were like, we need a place to put all that in one area. Okay. He wrote about it. He was like, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=505.36s)]
*  yeah, Jews are bringing Jews are bringing unlimited amounts of immigrants into the country. So [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=510.08s)]
*  I'm going to go with him. That's what he said. Okay. Wonderful thing that Donald Trump did for [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=516.56s)]
*  the Jews. Or who could forget when Donald Trump did that other wonderful thing for the Jews, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=521.04s)]
*  when marched on the streets of Charlottesville and said Jews will not replace us and said blood and [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=526.16s)]
*  soil and swung their swastika flags around. And then Donald Trump turned around and said, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=532.3199999999999s)]
*  there were very fine people on the side of the two. I mean, calm down. Okay. Hold up now. Was that [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=537.52s)]
*  was that a good thing that Trump did for the Jews? Like, in terms of things that Donald Trump did [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=543.1999999999999s)]
*  domestically for the Jewish demographic, not exactly great. Okay. Obviously, if we're talking [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=549.52s)]
*  about working class Jews, same principle Donald Trump was for working class Americans across the [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=556.88s)]
*  board, including working class Jews, you know, if we're talking about like specifically his fan base [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=562.4s)]
*  love that. So the idea that like, the idea that Donald Trump did a lot for American Jews, without [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=569.04s)]
*  talking about Israel is a really silly thing. And seems like seems to me like Americans don't [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=575.52s)]
*  really American Jews don't really give a shit about Israel all that much. I mean, there are [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=580.8s)]
*  definitely some who do this person included. But it's far from like the number one priority [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=583.84s)]
*  for American Jews. Because guess what? They don't live in Israel. They live in America. Shut the [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=589.04s)]
*  up. Okay. God damn is so stupid. The next prompt is Harris beat Trump in the debate. Will the [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=594.24s)]
*  agreeers please step forward? He can never openly support Jewish people or Israel his supporters [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=603.92s)]
*  will crucify him. You're wrong. His most supporters that aren't that resemble the exact same opinions [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=607.68s)]
*  of also happen to be evangelical Christians. They love Israel. They don't love Jews. They hate Jews, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=614.0799999999999s)]
*  but they love Israel. There's a theological justification for it. I'm not going to get into [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=620.0s)]
*  it right now. But make no mistake, Donald Trump loves Israel, literally more popular in Israel [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=624.0s)]
*  than Benjamin Netanyahu and more popular in Israel than he is here in the United States of America. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=630.0s)]
*  That is a fact. A fact that he even recognized at the conference. As a matter of fact, let's continue. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=634.4799999999999s)]
*  We're all looking at you. I'm happy to see you join us. Unfortunately, when I watched the debate, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=639.92s)]
*  you know, a lot of Republicans were saying that Trump was going to completely obliterate Kamala [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=645.68s)]
*  Harris. And I was one of those people, but I'm the kind of person I got to be factual and honest. And [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=650.64s)]
*  I can't lie to myself. Let's get the ob. Rose got the Trump hat on and he's somehow more rational [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=654.88s)]
*  than all the other. He's somehow more rational than all the other Trump supporters. How is that [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=660.08s)]
*  even possible? He is out of the way. It was a little bit bogus against Trump with one versus three. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=663.52s)]
*  They only fact check Trump. They didn't really fact check Kamala as much as I think they should [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=668.32s)]
*  have. But when one candidate lies more. We don't have to. And basically the only two times that [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=671.92s)]
*  they did fact check was we don't babies after nine months and Haitians aren't eating dogs in Ohio. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=678.24s)]
*  What? I don't think evangelicals hate Jews. That's just not true, brother, brother. Okay. Let me, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=686.72s)]
*  let me tell you something. Okay. If your religious justifications for the maintenance of Israel, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=692.96s)]
*  being given to the chosen sons of God ends up in that story with all of the Jews burning [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=700.24s)]
*  in eternal hellfire, then I don't think you give about Jews at all. Okay. Like what do you mean? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=706.4s)]
*  Dude, evangelical Christians that have a religious justification for maintaining Israel as a Jews, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=713.92s)]
*  don't burn in Christianity. Yes, they do. Jews that will not convert to evangelical Christianity. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=720.24s)]
*  When the rapture comes around, when Jesus Christ is fighting Megiddo or fighting Satan's armies in [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=726.56s)]
*  Megiddo, the ones, the Jews that don't convert to evangelical Christianity will absolutely burn [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=731.84s)]
*  in eternal damnation and hellfire. Just like the rest of us non-believers. Okay. Brother, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=737.44s)]
*  evangelical Christians think Catholics are going to burn in hell. What the are you talking about? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=742.4s)]
*  That's not specific to all Jews though. That's everyone. What are you saying? You're agreeing [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=746.08s)]
*  with me. The hate isn't for Jews. It's just ignorance. Yeah. Okay. Imagine American Christian [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=751.2s)]
*  having any meaningful level of religious literacy. No, of course not. No, dude. You don't understand [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=756.32s)]
*  their equal opportunity haters, not just Jews. I don't think it stems from though. Listen, is [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=761.28s)]
*  pretty widely shared in general. The notion that like Jews are somehow a monolithic force. They're [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=766.48s)]
*  an outsider that they like, uh, control the media. They control powerful institutions and they all [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=772.3199999999999s)]
*  operate with the same interest that interest happens to be Israel in this circumstance. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=778.8s)]
*  But in general, like total and utter domination, a lot of Americans, not just evangelical Christians [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=783.4399999999999s)]
*  also maintain these beliefs. The reason why I find it funny with evangelicals in particular [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=788.64s)]
*  is because they are so pro-Israel, but then at the end of that story, all the Jews die. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=794.4s)]
*  So I think that's hilarious that they're like, oh yeah, we love Israel. I am Israel. Hi brother. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=800.08s)]
*  But also they're all going to die and burn in burn in hell if they don't convert to Christianity. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=804.56s)]
*  But then beyond that I've heard I've seen like, I know how evangelicals operate in general, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=809.84s)]
*  especially in the deep South where they're segregated, where they're not exactly around [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=817.44s)]
*  Jewish people in general, where they like, well, somehow simultaneously believe that like, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=820.96s)]
*  you know, Jews are the chosen sons of God, but also they're magic money people who might have [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=825.7600000000001s)]
*  horns and tails. Like it's just being pro-Israel does not automatically make you not. And as a [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=831.2s)]
*  matter of fact, more pro-Israel. Okay. That's true though. That's true for sure. Okay. I don't think [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=836.8000000000001s)]
*  you meant like Jews are magic money people with horns is that's not what you were saying. That's [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=842.64s)]
*  true for sure too. Okay. Anyway, like the greatest example I will always use is pastor John Hagee, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=848.0799999999999s)]
*  a very famous televangelist who Israel loves. Okay. He was literally at the pro-Israel rally [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=855.68s)]
*  in DC. John Hagee famously said Holocaust was good because it led to the creation of Israel. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=860.88s)]
*  Okay. He also said it was Jewish and that he did the Holocaust so that they could create Israel. So, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=866.4s)]
*  you know, not exactly a guy who I think is, I don't know, even remotely considered a pro-Jewish man [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=873.84s)]
*  overall. He is pro-Israel, however, he's very pro-Israel. So Israel loves him. Israeli envoys [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=881.52s)]
*  love him, but not necessarily pro-Jew if you catch my drift. Okay. Well, Kamala Harris perpetuated [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=886.9599999999999s)]
*  the myth that Donald Trump said there are five people on both sides, even though Politico came [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=893.68s)]
*  out and said that this is missing a lot of context. Do you need to see the video? When Trump said there [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=898.56s)]
*  are five people on both sides, he was talking about two kinds of people. One were historians who wanted [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=903.3599999999999s)]
*  to keep the Robert E. Lee statue in place. Yikes this streamer. What? So untrue. How does anyone [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=907.8399999999999s)]
*  watch this? Lol, a guy who hasn't stepped foot in Israel spewing such things. So untrue Hassan. Wait, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=913.1999999999999s)]
*  imagine speaking for the majority of Jews though. First of all, I don't give a [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=919.92s)]
*  about speaking for the majority of anything. I'm just speaking for humanity and what my moral [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=923.68s)]
*  position is on any issue. Okay. I'm anti across the board. Sorry if that frustrates you, but also [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=928.16s)]
*  nothing I said about Pastor John Hagee was untrue. I wasn't even talking about Jews. I was talking [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=935.6s)]
*  about evangelical Christians. You say get owned. What? Okay. You might be a little stupid to [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=941.92s)]
*  understand words that are coming out of my mouth. It's okay though. We'll catch up with you in a [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=946.8s)]
*  little bit when your mind reboots. And the other group were people who wanted to tear the statue [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=950.88s)]
*  down. So the Antifa, the left-wing individuals and the historians. These were the two groups of [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=954.9599999999999s)]
*  people he initially were talking about. Now there's the white supremacists and the hooligans who came [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=961.1999999999999s)]
*  to interrupt. This was an outside group. To be fair, using a televangelist is kind of bad faith. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=965.76s)]
*  That's crazy to say using a televangelist is an example of bad faith. This person commands the [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=970.8s)]
*  will of thousands. Are you kidding me? He was invited to speak at the pro-Israel rally in [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=976.16s)]
*  Washington DC. That is an insane thing. He's one of the leaders. What are we talking about? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=984.3199999999999s)]
*  What the... And that's just one example I just used. There are many others. Did you just... What's [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=992.0799999999999s)]
*  the argument here? Former believer slash seminary student here. That's not entirely true. Using a [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=997.36s)]
*  televangelist as an example is bad faith. You're right. The famously not famous televangelist. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1001.52s)]
*  I didn't even just say like an evangelical pastor with a small congregation. I used a very specific, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1007.6s)]
*  very famous televangelist for a very specific reason. And you're in here making the argument [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1013.36s)]
*  that televangelists are not, especially this one in particular, are not famous or influential? What [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1020.24s)]
*  the... That's crazy. Who came to Charlottesville to stir up trouble. So when people say that there [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1027.92s)]
*  are... I just really have to stop. So when Donald Trump... They're referring to them as historians. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1033.04s)]
*  When we're talking about people who chanted Jews... Chatter said the founder of Christians United for [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1038.0s)]
*  Israel, the founder for Christians United for Israel, the largest pro-Israel group in the [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1043.92s)]
*  United States of America by donations is actually an insignificant small bean in the grand scheme of [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1050.8s)]
*  things. Just a small guy. Just your local pastor, dude. He's just got some crazy ideas. Like what is [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1058.8799999999999s)]
*  happening, dude? Then Trump is not representative of the Republican party. He's just a small bean TV guy. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1067.04s)]
*  Who can I use as an example if not that guy? He is literally the guy. That's crazy, man. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1073.36s)]
*  He's not replacing us. And chants that were used in World War II. You're talking about Charlottesville. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1080.8799999999999s)]
*  What it seems like is historians that were sympathetic to keeping the statues in public view. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1085.28s)]
*  And we're talking about a statue of Robert E. Lee as Civil War General. But even the historians that [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1088.8799999999999s)]
*  you're referencing, if they were actual historians, wouldn't you want those types of statues in [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1093.04s)]
*  something like a museum or somewhere where people can learn the historical context, not in the public... [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1097.04s)]
*  And those historians did. They enslaved your people. I think we've covered, just so you know, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1101.44s)]
*  remember the prompt is, I think... Oh, we forgot about that. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1107.2s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yes. To be honest, I want to extend just a, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1110.48s)]
*  I have mad respect for anybody here, any Trump supporter who will stand here in this room and say [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1114.96s)]
*  anything in support of the guy who gave that debate performance. Literally speaking, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1123.1200000000001s)]
*  as a Filipino person who for years, we have a play named Dog Eaters on us. It was Dog [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1127.92s)]
*  Eating and othering of meats were used to other us and to make us feel like some other kind of [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1136.16s)]
*  different dehumanizing thing because we're eating people's pets. And now they're putting it on Haitians [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1143.3600000000001s)]
*  and now there's threats in Ohio because of this ridiculous thing that he spewed because he... [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1149.1200000000001s)]
*  W. Angto, A1 Yapper. Yeah, he loves yapping. Got triggered because Kamala talked about how [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1154.5600000000002s)]
*  people were walking out of his crowds because he's bored and tired and senile. And the main reason [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1160.48s)]
*  why I am sitting down is because Donald Trump took too much bait. I think that that kind of [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1166.08s)]
*  performance was okay against Biden. And if you guys notice, a lot of the things he said against [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1170.32s)]
*  Kamala, he said against Biden about the abortion, the baby being after it's born. He never should [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1174.1599999999999s)]
*  have said that about a lot of the points that he made. He made against Biden and he did it against [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1178.72s)]
*  Kamala too. But the thing is, Biden literally just fell apart and quote unquote died on stage. What [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1183.12s)]
*  we saw last time, that's why they switched him out with Kamala. So I guess Trump kind of, I was [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1189.52s)]
*  expecting him to change his playbook. You have to go after her. Okay, this video is much better [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1193.68s)]
*  than the other format, the 20 v 1 format. It's hard to go after her record when she's impeccable, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1198.24s)]
*  right? We have the only qualified person there. A prosecutor, an attorney general, a senator, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1203.28s)]
*  and a vice president. So for him to go after her, you know, he can't go after her policy because [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1208.0s)]
*  it's good. All he can do is make the same old, she said it herself, the same old playbook. And [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1212.64s)]
*  that's what we saw. And she totally destroyed him. She came with facts. She also let, you know, just [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1216.72s)]
*  pointed out just how ridiculous the things were that he was saying, you know, to your point about [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1221.6s)]
*  the, you know, eating dogs and all of that stuff. I mean, none of it was factual. It had already been [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1225.36s)]
*  released that none of that stuff was true and he's still going to put it forward. But I respect you [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1229.76s)]
*  for coming forward. We're going to pause here. We're going to bring in our disagreeers. So I [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1233.36s)]
*  would say that when I judge, you know, my kids play sports, when I judge who won or who didn't [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1238.48s)]
*  won, I want it to be an even playing field. And I think it should be a fair contest. And I know you [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1244.7199999999998s)]
*  guys love Kamala Harris and you think she has an impeccable record. Kamala. But CNN has pronounced [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1250.16s)]
*  it 12, 20 times on record, but different ways. We're telling you, we're telling you. Just like every other person. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1256.88s)]
*  Semantics, you guys. Let's not get stuck. Let's go to policies. Can we just pronounce your name right, please? [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1262.5600000000002s)]
*  Let's go past this and hear the rest of it. So I think that there have been a lot of things that [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1268.0s)]
*  have been fact-checked by social media influencers and commentators like myself on Ms. Harris's [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1272.3200000000002s)]
*  policies and what she said as well. And there are certainly things that could have been fact-checked [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1277.76s)]
*  on that end as well. Like what? And I want to touch you. I too am an immigrant. My family escaped [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1282.16s)]
*  on the back of a pickup truck from Iran in 1985 while being shot at by border police. I spent a night [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1287.92s)]
*  in the Pakistani deserts. We were caught and we had to escape. And it took six months for my family [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1294.0s)]
*  to come here not speaking English. We left everything behind. Started from nothing, living in a two-bedroom [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1300.16s)]
*  apartment with eight people in it. The reason why I say that is, you know, America is the greatest [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1304.96s)]
*  country on earth. And to erase its history instead of learning from it is what they did in China. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1309.68s)]
*  What has been and looking forward to what can be is literally what was used by people trying to get [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1316.88s)]
*  rid of the old and bringing in the new world. Like China communist party. Well the group of people being affected by those statues are telling you [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1322.72s)]
*  what it's doing to us. Correct. Iranians are the Cubans of the MENA region. This is a Hasanabi position. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1328.16s)]
*  I've been, I've said this, I've said this so much and not all Iranians obviously, but Iranians living in Los Angeles, okay? [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1334.3200000000002s)]
*  Persians are so Cuban diaspora coded. It is crazy, okay? Shah writers especially. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1344.4s)]
*  He's the one that's adjusted to go into a museum. We're talking a lot about this statue but we do want to hear about the debate. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1353.68s)]
*  Can we, let's just switch back to the debate. If we want to talk about the statue again later, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1358.24s)]
*  we totally can. Yeah, I don't think either one of them won the debate. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1362.0s)]
*  Who are the Cubans of Asia? The Cubans of Asia are older Vietnamese and the Cubans of Africa. I don't know. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1365.84s)]
*  I don't know who would be like the closest to the Cuban diaspora among Africans, but I think like, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1374.16s)]
*  I think the older Viet, older Viet population, very very right wing. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1379.92s)]
*  I wouldn't even say, I wouldn't even say like South Koreans to that same degree honestly. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1386.48s)]
*  White South Africans, okay, that doesn't count dude. Come on, come on. Egyptians, not really. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1390.88s)]
*  Why South Africans doesn't count. That's like, come on. That's just like British by a different name. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1397.6000000000001s)]
*  Okay, calm down. But like not, no, not even Nigerians because like Nigerians fresh off the boat, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1402.24s)]
*  maybe, but Nigerians like two years into living in America and recognizing that like Americans make [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1408.0800000000002s)]
*  no distinction between you and other black people in the same way that you thought there was a [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1414.3200000000002s)]
*  distinction that existed. Once that, once that goes away, it's like, is, is Jover. No, Nigerians [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1418.56s)]
*  should have think they're better than us. Other black people. No, I don't, I don't know. Maybe. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1424.72s)]
*  I don't think so. You'd be surprised the whole black American versus African discussions. No, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1429.9199999999998s)]
*  I'm very familiar with the black American versus African discussions. I am very, very familiar with [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1433.76s)]
*  it. It's just that that kind of goes away after you're like first or second police stop in the [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1438.32s)]
*  United States of America, because then you realize like, Oh, okay, nevermind. Anyway, let's move on [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1443.6s)]
*  from black people business. I feel like the only people that really lost were other than them was [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1448.4s)]
*  the American people. Just, I mean, I imagine we can all kind of agree on that. Nothing was really [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1454.48s)]
*  said. Nothing was really, you know, we're going to do this, we're going to do that. But nothing [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1460.0s)]
*  ever actually gets done. I think as far as the debate goes, Trump dropped the ball on a couple [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1463.68s)]
*  things. The Medicare or Medicaid conversation or question that that he received, he kind of, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1468.88s)]
*  I can't believe there are Iranians or Trump supporters. Oh my God, my friend, my friend, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1474.8799999999999s)]
*  let me tell you something. You have never been to Los Angeles, my friend. Okay. Saying, I can't [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1480.8s)]
*  believe there are Iranians or Trump supporters is like saying, I can't believe there are Cubans who [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1486.8s)]
*  are Trump supporters. It's the opposite where you're like, I can't believe there are Iranians that are [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1490.24s)]
*  not Trump supporters, bro. He destroyed us. What do you mean? Yeah. Yeah. Because you're Iranian. I [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1494.72s)]
*  don't think, I don't think they see it the same way. I dropped the ball on that one. But other [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1500.32s)]
*  than that, it was just a bunch of zingers and like back and forth. And so about your hand up to make [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1505.6799999999998s)]
*  sure that the other side knows that you're judging the, you know, I'm judging you, Trump. Like it was, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1511.9199999999998s)]
*  it was more show than anything. Kamala handled herself. I'll give you that. Like Kamala did a [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1517.36s)]
*  lot better than a lot of people thought she did. I think that's why a lot of people are saying she [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1522.3999999999999s)]
*  won because we all, you know, she did better than Biden and anybody that did better than Biden, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1527.76s)]
*  it's like, hell yeah. We have a winner guys, you know, but at the end of the day, that was a low [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1533.84s)]
*  bar. Yeah. We're going to reset. Hey, before we go any further, we want to take a moment to say, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1538.48s)]
*  thanks so much to straight arrow news for probably did it because they let in out people from Trump, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1543.52s)]
*  from the debate, they allowed many, many millions of, they allowed terrorists, they allowed common [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1551.12s)]
*  street, they allowed people to come in drug dealers to come into our country. And then now [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1557.44s)]
*  in the United States, and I think they probably did it because they think they're going to get [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1561.68s)]
*  votes, but it's not worth it. If you agree, someone is asking what the Cuban and Iranian thing is. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1565.44s)]
*  Yes. Cubans in America, Cubans diaspora are very reactionary, very right wing. Okay. Especially [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1570.4s)]
*  older populations. So because of like the famous nature of not only amnesty, but also America's [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1576.96s)]
*  relationship with Cuba in general and the, the ways in which the Cuban diaspora has formed its [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1584.08s)]
*  political opinions in the United States of America, specifically Florida has, we just use it as a [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1590.72s)]
*  catchall term for reactionary diaspora, as opposed to like the interest of the people back home [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1596.48s)]
*  in the host nation. This does not mean like every single Cuban that is in the United States of [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1602.48s)]
*  America is like that. But most people understand like the broad majority of the Cuban diaspora [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1608.0s)]
*  living in Florida, especially older Cubans are very right wing. With that quote step forward. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1613.04s)]
*  I was just, from that quote, at least from what I got personally was he was talking about the illegal [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1620.3999999999999s)]
*  immigrants that aren't being background checked, that are being let in. Personally to me, my [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1625.12s)]
*  grandparents and my mother are immigrants. They're not from here and they came here and they worked [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1630.56s)]
*  very hard to get their residency and their citizenship. And they went through all the [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1635.12s)]
*  bells and whistles to get through here. Which is why I think everyone else should also suffer a [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1639.6s)]
*  similar fate. And so they're letting people in. I mean, it's affected so many of my friends that live [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1644.08s)]
*  towards the border of San Diego, places like that. So many Republicans attitudes are basically like, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1650.6399999999999s)]
*  I had to go through so much chemotherapy to get rid of cancer in my body. Okay. And that's why I am [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1657.9199999999998s)]
*  against cancer vaccines. Like it's just that it's the, and she didn't even have to go through any [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1667.36s)]
*  of that. I'm just saying like she's carrying the resentment of the older generation with her. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1674.1599999999999s)]
*  And it's very weird. Like if you have overcome great odds, not her because she's a fetus, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1678.9599999999998s)]
*  but her parents, it makes no sense that you would want others to be subjected to the same thing. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1685.9199999999998s)]
*  I just don't understand it. It literally does not make sense to me at all. This is one of the [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1692.8s)]
*  core principles of like reactionary conservatives that I just cannot even understand a little bit. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1698.48s)]
*  I just don't get it. And it's the same principle across the board. Like it literally is, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1705.6s)]
*  it's just such a boomer mindset where it's like, nah, I had to pick myself up on my bootstrap. So [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1710.1599999999999s)]
*  you have to too. It's like, no man, shut the fuck up. The whole point is supposed to be [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1716.1599999999999s)]
*  the whole point is supposed to be, we ease it for everybody else. Like, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1722.24s)]
*  you know, what the wrong with you? It's so annoying when I hear this about student loan debt. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1726.32s)]
*  Like I not only paid my own student loans, I paid my mother's student loans. I paid my brother's [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1732.1599999999999s)]
*  student loans. And I don't think anyone should have to pay student loans. They should get student [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1736.24s)]
*  loan debt relief. Okay. I will never understand people that are like, well, I paid it. So you [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1741.12s)]
*  have to as well. It's like you, man, you're just a selfish piece of it is purely a policy [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1746.4s)]
*  surrounding resentment, jealousy, entitlement, nothing else. They are letting people in that [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1751.52s)]
*  are that are not being checked well, or at least not being checked at all. And I think that's what [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1757.52s)]
*  he meant. He kind of has a really sassy way of saying things or kind of just, sometimes I feel [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1763.2800000000002s)]
*  like he doesn't use, he's not very eloquent at times. And so he says things and people are like, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1768.72s)]
*  well, what does that mean? That doesn't make any sense. That's at least the context that I'm [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1774.64s)]
*  getting it from. That's at least what I can see. And that's at least what's been proven. So [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1777.76s)]
*  I also feel that way. I feel like a lot of the people that are just being willing, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1781.8400000000001s)]
*  really let in here are they're passing multiple other countries just to get to America to claim [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1787.0400000000002s)]
*  asylum in America. I don't blame anybody for coming here at all. I'd like if I was born outside of [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1792.0800000000002s)]
*  this country, I would want to do the exact same thing we but that's why we have to live people [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1798.72s)]
*  that are coming here now. I understand why they want to get here. But fuck them. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1802.96s)]
*  Us as Americans, all of us hit the lottery when when we got born here. And if you've come here [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1808.0s)]
*  legally through the process, my issue is the like his position is more understandable than hers [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1814.32s)]
*  because at least like, she somehow understands how long and arduous and complex the process of like, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1820.0s)]
*  getting citizenship is he does it. So that's why he can so callously be like, [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1826.48s)]
*  yeah, come through the legal means it's like, bro, what are you talking about? You have no idea how [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1832.24s)]
*  hard this process is. Okay, shut up. It is deliberately difficult. Also, many of the people [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1837.52s)]
*  that you're talking about are legal asylum seekers, which means they are actually following the [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1842.96s)]
*  process. They are following the protocol, you have to step foot inside of the United States to seek [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1848.72s)]
*  asylum, shut the fuck up. But for a lot of these people, the distinction between a legal Haitian [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1853.92s)]
*  migrant and an illegal migrant is nothing. It's just, they realize that it's paperwork, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=1860.4s)]

*  than 2% of Americans join the military and volunteer to join our military forces. And the [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=2042.32s)]
*  fact that we have homeless vets... Good. It should be even lower than that. Okay. It should be 0%. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=2049.2s)]
*  And it will. If by the time I'm done with it, it will be. Should not be a thing. And we're just [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=2054.56s)]

*  should cause you to understand that America doesn't give a f*** about veterans, dog. But no, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=2073.12s)]
*  these guys only use veterans as a counterpoint when talking about immigrants is so tired and old and... [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=2078.08s)]
*  Come here illegally. Don't play by the same rules. I see a lot of nods. Do you believe that this is [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=2084.4s)]
*  strategy? You talked about like the sense, how it affects the census. Oh, yeah. Absolutely. I mean, [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=2089.84s)]
*  over 60 million people have come into this country illegally during this administration. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=2094.4s)]
*  And immigration actually is the thing that catapulted me from Democrat to Republican. I'm [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=2098.64s)]
*  from Chicago. And as you know, we have the migrant crisis, thousands upon thousands. We're talking [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=2103.44s)]
*  50,000 illegal immigrants that just hit our city. And I actually did vote for Biden. I'll whisper [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=2108.88s)]
*  and say that. You know, not that proud to admit it now, but I remember when they first turned [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=2114.56s)]
*  a school in my area into a migrant shelter. And it was the Wadsworth Elementary School. And they [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=2118.96s)]
*  also turned South Shore High School into a migrant shelter as well. When they did that, [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=2123.84s)]
*  I remember the protest. I remember going to these community meetings that they have [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=2127.28s)]
*  about how they're going to explain to you how immigrants need help. And I remember sitting there [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=2131.04s)]
*  as a person who voted for Biden. And I'm just listening to these people that all demand, you [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=2135.84s)]
*  know, city council members, pro-immigrant groups. They come to lecture us black folk on the south [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=2139.6800000000003s)]
*  side of Chicago. And they talk to us like we're stupid. You know, these people are from Venezuela. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=2144.8s)]
*  They speak Spanish. They live in poverty. They need help. And that's why this facility in your [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=2150.56s)]
*  neighborhood is being turned into a migrant shelter. So it's very frustrating, but the [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=2156.56s)]
*  Democrats are sort of lecturing this condescending tone that they use against you. I don't need to be [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=2160.56s)]
*  lectured to about what people need. Black- Bro, you need to be lectured about a lot of- [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=2166.32s)]
*  Okay. Like, I'm going to be real. You need to be- you need to go back to school. Okay? Everyone does. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=2170.4s)]
*  God damn. People in Chicago need help. Veterans, as you were saying earlier, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=2177.52s)]
*  they need help. Poor people need help. There is no clear indication that these people don't give [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=2181.6s)]
*  a f- about veterans than the fact that they only bring up veterans when talking about like [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=2187.44s)]
*  immigrants, dude. It's just so obvious. Like if you gave a f- about veterans, [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=2193.2s)]
*  you'd be talking about it in other circumstances, but you don't because you don't care. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=2197.84s)]
*  We have a lot of problems in our own community and I respect people and I understand the passion [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=2202.64s)]
*  and ambition behind people who come to this country, but to explain and lecture to me why [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=2207.28s)]

*  but I'm going to bring in the disagreeors for time. So I might let some of the people on my side even [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=2216.88s)]
*  talk about Biden's shift to the right when it comes to immigration, more deportations in the [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=2223.52s)]
*  Trump administration. That's not something that I'm particularly passionate about. I don't really [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=2227.52s)]

*  about who necessarily is in this country is increase the pathway to citizenship. Not only [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=2239.84s)]
*  should we be able to vet who these people are, we'll be able to add them and actually fully [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=2244.24s)]

*  Hispanics that come from there have conservative values. You shouldn't just write them off as [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=2257.04s)]
*  people that can't drive or people that are not talented. I'm not saying they're not talented, [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9D4Q5kTuLY&t=2260.96s)]
