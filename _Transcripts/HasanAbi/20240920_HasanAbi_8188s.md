# Hasan Hosts The Hasanabi Debatelords At TWITCHCON 2024
**HasanAbi:** [September 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0)
*  Koi Grimm. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=0.0s)]
*  Anyway, let's go live to Hasanabi. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2.2600000000000002s)]
*  Welcome TwitchCon San Diego! [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7.12s)]
*  I'm Asan Piker, also known as Hasanabi, and I wanted to give you all a very special welcome to Debate Lords. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  I have never read Cue cards before until this very moment, and you're gonna see that tonight. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=24.0s)]
*  It's gonna happen a lot for those of you watching at home, but I wanted to also do a very special thank you to our fantastic hosts who are gonna be carrying the show. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=28.12s)]
*  Wil Neff and Austin Schoenberg! [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  Throughout history, and as intellectually-sparred in the marketplace of ideas, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  debate was sport as old as time itself. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=58.12s)]
*  Countless hours of moral grandstanding spent proving who's the smartest, the loudest, and most attractive. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=63.12s)]
*  And thus, civilization evolved, guided by the sweaty hands of its most worthy debate lords. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=73.12s)]
*  Now, thanks to the internet, debate has reached its final form. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=82.12s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, good evening and welcome to TwitchCon San Diego! [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=92.12s)]
*  We're live here in the Twitch Rivals Arena for a one-time very special event. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=115.12s)]
*  That's right, Austin. In just moments, four of the greatest internet creators in the world and Nick Pallum will take the stage for the most inconsequential, non-political debate of this or any election year. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=121.12s)]
*  All hosted and moderated by the internet's premier provocateur. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=139.12s)]
*  We're glad you're here, ladies and gentlemen. This is Hasanabi's Debate Horrors! [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=145.12s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Debate Lords! We are live from TwitchCon San Diego! What the hell? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=150.12s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live from TwitchCon San Diego! [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=177.12s)]
*  That's a very fast prompter. I cannot read that fast. Look at this crowd, Will. It's incredible. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=183.12s)]
*  They are a gorgeous crowd. Make some noise, TwitchCon San Diego! [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=191.12s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Austin Schoen alongside Will Neff. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=200.12s)]
*  And we are thrilled to be here alongside our esteemed homophobic moderator, Hasan Peiker. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=209.12s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=214.12s)]
*  A lot of homophobes in the audience tonight. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=216.12s)]
*  For Debate Lords, the live debate event America never needed and didn't ask for. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=219.12s)]
*  That's right, Austin. We've invited some of the world's funniest and most available streamers to argue with each other about some truly inane topics. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=225.12s)]
*  And I got to tell you, Austin, the stakes could not be lower. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=235.12s)]
*  But Will, I have to tell you, that's not true. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=239.12s)]
*  Oh? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=242.12s)]
*  That's not true. Each debater here is representing a charity of their choice. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=243.12s)]
*  And we are counting on all of you. Yes, you. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=248.12s)]
*  Oh, yeah, that's you right there. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=253.12s)]
*  All of you watching, lend your support and donate during the show. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=255.12s)]
*  All the charities tonight will be benefiting charity. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=259.12s)]
*  But you'll also have the chance to donate to unlock extra challenges and some amazing surprises. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=266.12s)]
*  So let's take a look at that milestone list. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=272.12s)]
*  Ooh, look at these milestones. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=274.12s)]
*  Unleash the mime. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=276.12s)]
*  Oh, I thought that was the name of a fish song. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=278.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=283.12s)]
*  Pudding Cup Challenge. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=285.12s)]
*  The Will and Austin Mystery Box. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=287.12s)]
*  Let me tell you, they're going to have fun with that one. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=290.12s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=293.12s)]
*  Step one is cutting a hole in the box. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=294.12s)]
*  That's right. And everybody knows what step two is. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=296.12s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=298.12s)]
*  Spaghetti pockets. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=300.12s)]
*  Hassan gets a very ugly face tattoo. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=302.12s)]
*  Oh, I love that. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=305.12s)]
*  And pie in the face. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=306.12s)]
*  That could be anything. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=308.12s)]
*  That could be really anything. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=310.12s)]
*  Truly. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=312.12s)]
*  We don't know. You have to keep donating to find out. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=313.12s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=316.12s)]
*  All right, folks, we need your help to make sure we hit these milestones throughout the night. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=317.12s)]
*  Scan the QR code on the screen or type out the URL Tiltify slash Debate Lords. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=321.12s)]
*  All of the money raised tonight is going to a few great causes. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=326.12s)]
*  Doctors Without Borders, Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=329.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=333.12s)]
*  No Kid Hungry and Make-A-Wish America. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=334.12s)]
*  If you want to see us unleash the mime in the first round, make sure we hit that milestone soon. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=337.12s)]
*  Will, do you think the mime is going to distract them? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=342.12s)]
*  Well, mimes are famously silent, so he might have to get a little handsy. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=346.12s)]
*  That's right. What would you do if you were the mime, Will? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=352.12s)]
*  Get a little handsy. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=354.12s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=355.12s)]
*  Oh, that's right. That's amazing. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=356.12s)]
*  So, Will, let's tell the people what they're going to see tonight. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=359.12s)]
*  Sure. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=362.12s)]
*  How about that? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=363.12s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=364.12s)]
*  The show is divided up into a series of six debate rounds, each with a different topic and different set of rules. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=365.12s)]
*  For example, the debaters might be split into teams or given restrictions on what they can or can't say. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=370.12s)]
*  Tonight is all for charity, but obviously someone has to win or the whole thing is really stupid. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=376.12s)]
*  That's what Hassan is here for. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=383.12s)]
*  He'll be awarding points based on debate performance in each round. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=385.12s)]
*  He can add points, subtract points, mute microphones, add time to a speaker. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=388.12s)]
*  He can pretty much do whatever he wants. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=393.12s)]
*  And, Chad, you will also get to vote for additional points in each round. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=396.12s)]
*  The debater with the most points at the end will be crowned the winner. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=400.12s)]
*  That's right, Austin. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=404.12s)]
*  Extremely exciting, Will. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=405.12s)]
*  Very exciting stuff. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=407.12s)]
*  And now, ladies and gentlemen, I think Austin's mic is gone. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=408.12s)]
*  Please all rise if you're able, not for the national anthem. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=415.12s)]
*  It's time to meet our moderator, our judge, the ultimate unfailing authority. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=420.12s)]
*  Austin's still trying on that mic. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=425.12s)]
*  His word is law, and whoever's decision could have massive ramifications for the reputation and mental stability of our participants. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=428.12s)]
*  The man who put the Hassanabi in Hassanabi's debate, lords, give it up for Hassanabi. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=438.12s)]
*  Oh, look at him, Austin. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=445.12s)]
*  He looks good. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=449.12s)]
*  Confident, tall, wide. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=451.12s)]
*  Austin, what do you think's going through his head? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=457.12s)]
*  You know, he's probably very, very nervous. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=459.12s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=464.12s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=465.12s)]
*  That koi grin. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=466.12s)]
*  Anyway, let's go live to Hassanabi. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=468.12s)]
*  Welcome TwitchCon San Diego. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=473.12s)]
*  I'm Asan Piker, also known as Hassanabi, and I wanted to give you all a very special welcome to Debate Lords. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=480.12s)]
*  I have never read cue cards before until this very moment. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=490.12s)]
*  You're going to see that tonight. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=493.12s)]
*  It's going to happen a lot for those of you watching at home, but I wanted to also give a very special thank you to our fantastic hosts who are going to be carrying the show. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=495.12s)]
*  Will Neff and Austin Show. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=504.12s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=506.12s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=507.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=508.12s)]
*  Come on. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=511.12s)]
*  Over here too. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=513.12s)]
*  We haven't forgot about you. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=514.12s)]
*  Get on your feet. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=516.12s)]
*  It's. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=518.12s)]
*  Today, we are going to find out what our panelists think about some truly weird stuff. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=521.12s)]
*  We're not going to be talking about politics. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=527.12s)]
*  I know many of you, even though we very clearly marketed the event as a non-political satire debate show, probably still think we're going to be talking about politics. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=529.12s)]
*  We're not. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=538.12s)]
*  And on top of that, we're also going to be doing something else that you guys are unfamiliar with. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=540.12s)]
*  It's a sports style show called Around the Horn. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=546.12s)]
*  I'm going to be issuing points as the moderator, the judge, the jury, and the executioner for whoever I feel like it. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=548.12s)]
*  I mean, originally it was going to be Ludwig here and he couldn't make it. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=556.12s)]
*  Unfortunately, he's dead to me officially. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=559.12s)]
*  I was going to mute him a bunch, but this time it's actually going to be W. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=561.12s)]
*  Neff, you Jason the wean that I'll be muting in instead. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=565.12s)]
*  But without further ado, Austin and will, should we bring our debate lords out or what? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=569.12s)]
*  Look, I saw I think the crowd is almost ready. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=575.12s)]
*  However, I need to remind you, Chad, remember to keep donating throughout the night so we get to hit all of our milestones. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=579.12s)]
*  It's for the kids. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=585.12s)]
*  Come on. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=587.12s)]
*  Extra few dollars, right? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=588.12s)]
*  A lot of these milestones could happen at any time, even in the middle of the debate. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=590.12s)]
*  But right now, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome your debate lords. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=594.12s)]
*  That's right. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=601.12s)]

*  Listen, this is not what's incredible. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=665.12s)]
*  All I need to do is start eating to make this a normal broadcast. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=667.12s)]
*  OK, muted microphones. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=671.12s)]
*  I got to get up and piss in a little bit. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=673.12s)]

*  Let's go down the road starting with Sear. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=680.12s)]
*  Everybody, I want you to let everyone in the room know who you are. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=683.12s)]
*  And how do you think you're going to perform today? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=687.12s)]
*  Sear, starting with you. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=690.12s)]
*  My name is Sear. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=692.12s)]
*  I'm from Southern Kentucky. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=694.12s)]
*  Well, I'm representing Big Corn and I think that that industry suffering [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=698.12s)]
*  in a room full of centers like yourself. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=703.12s)]
*  I think my policies are going to hold up and I'm going to show you how exquisite it's going to be. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=707.12s)]
*  So let's throw it over to the woman. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=714.12s)]
*  Up. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=718.12s)]
*  Caroline Kwan. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=720.12s)]
*  Sorry, I just have to say, hi, everyone. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=722.12s)]

*  I'm sorry, Sear. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=742.12s)]
*  I couldn't hear you. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=744.12s)]
*  You have so much oil in your hair. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=746.12s)]
*  You got more than Chevron, which I think is here tonight. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=747.12s)]
*  So did you borrow some? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=750.12s)]
*  All right, all right, contestants, let's keep it simple, please. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=752.12s)]
*  Okay, Jason, the win. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=755.12s)]
*  Hello. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=758.12s)]
*  I got zero cheers from the crowd. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=759.12s)]
*  I'm happy to be here. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=761.12s)]
*  I feel like I'm the underdog. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=762.12s)]
*  I always have been. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=763.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=765.12s)]

*  Thank you. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=767.12s)]
*  Not too much, though. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=768.12s)]
*  Not too much. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=769.12s)]

*  I'm feeling impeccable onto this old hag right here. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=772.12s)]
*  Is that the word you wanted to actually use? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=777.12s)]
*  I think he just learned that word backstage. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=780.12s)]
*  No. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=782.12s)]
*  So he's testing it out. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=783.12s)]
*  He's hilarious. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=785.12s)]
*  Okay, Nick Pallum. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=786.12s)]

*  You look fantastic. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=797.12s)]
*  Speaking of looking fantastic, baby no money. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=799.12s)]
*  Also, baby no gaming? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=802.12s)]
*  Baby no games? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=805.12s)]
*  Yeah, that's my second alias in life, and I don't really know why I'm fully here, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=806.12s)]
*  but ladies and gentlemen, I am so happy to be here and tell you about what I need to do for this country and this planet. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=811.12s)]

*  Are you all ready? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=825.12s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=827.12s)]
*  All right, to the panelists. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=829.12s)]
*  Anyone here with actually like any any formal debate experience? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=830.12s)]
*  What? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=836.12s)]
*  Every day of my life as a woman. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=837.12s)]
*  Okay, that's a point for feminism, starting early. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=841.12s)]
*  Okay, so no one else. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=845.12s)]
*  No one else. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=848.12s)]
*  I got some experience. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=849.12s)]
*  I would argue with my girlfriend, but it didn't work out, so. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=850.12s)]
*  Damn. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=853.12s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=855.12s)]
*  Okay, you only get one of those. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=856.12s)]
*  And that was it. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=857.12s)]
*  That was it. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=858.12s)]
*  That was it. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=859.12s)]
*  I did the credit. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=860.12s)]
*  Okay, bombing everybody out. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=861.12s)]
*  Nick Pallum. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=862.12s)]
*  All right, on that note, everyone ready? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=863.12s)]
*  Then let's get ready to rumble. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=866.12s)]
*  All right. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=874.12s)]
*  I'm going to keep throwing those cards away like that. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=875.12s)]
*  They told me to do that, but I don't think it looks cool. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=877.12s)]
*  Anyway, regardless. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=880.12s)]
*  All right. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=881.12s)]
*  Round one. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=882.12s)]
*  Let's get debating for the first round. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=883.12s)]
*  We are going to keep it simple. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=886.12s)]
*  We're going to get the juices flowing. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=888.12s)]
*  Many of you are unfamiliar, uninitiated, but we're going to work through that. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=890.12s)]
*  This is going to be a general open debate like we're all used to seeing on [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=894.12s)]
*  television with presidents. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=898.12s)]
*  Hopefully with less cat eating memes. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=900.12s)]
*  We'll start. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=903.12s)]
*  We'll start with a question for every single person. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=904.12s)]
*  You are going to have 40. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=907.12s)]
*  Jason, you better be paying attention right now. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=908.12s)]
*  This is the most important part. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=910.12s)]
*  I know he's not has no idea. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=911.12s)]
*  He was talking to his chat on his mic. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=913.12s)]
*  I saw him. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=915.12s)]
*  We're going to start with a question for everyone. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=916.12s)]
*  You are going to have 45 seconds or so to answer, and then we're going to open [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=918.12s)]
*  it up a bit. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=923.12s)]
*  You can take pot shots at one another. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=924.12s)]
*  It's all good. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=925.12s)]
*  But if you do too much cross talk, I might mute you or even take away some [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=926.12s)]
*  of your points. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=929.12s)]
*  You'll have a chance to respond to what someone else said, or if we feel like [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=930.12s)]
*  we've exhausted the topic, we're going to move on to something else. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=933.12s)]
*  So let's get started with the first question. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=938.12s)]
*  First question is for you, Seir. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=941.12s)]
*  Yes, I would have to say particularly I do agree. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=945.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=949.12s)]
*  I haven't even asked the question yet. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=950.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=952.12s)]
*  All right. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=954.12s)]
*  Seir, what is the better cracker and why is it Ritz or saltine? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=956.12s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=966.12s)]
*  Could you say that one more time, the word? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=967.12s)]
*  I said what is the better cracker? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=970.12s)]
*  Good. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=975.12s)]
*  Can I hear it using a sentence, please? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=976.12s)]
*  A cracker. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=979.12s)]
*  You know. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=981.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=983.12s)]
*  Like a guy from Ohio. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=984.12s)]
*  I've had quite the experience with crackers. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=990.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=996.12s)]
*  But which one is better, Ritz or saltine? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=997.12s)]
*  Well, primarily saltine. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=999.12s)]
*  Now, my grandma, and she was a woman of the people more so than, you know. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1002.12s)]
*  You're saying your grandma was ugly. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1012.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1016.12s)]
*  Points for Caroline. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1017.12s)]
*  I have permission to strike her with the hand of God. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1018.12s)]
*  You're going to have to pray hard for that. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1021.12s)]
*  I'll answer your question. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1023.12s)]
*  Saltine. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1024.12s)]
*  I've been a saltine man. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1025.12s)]
*  And I believe that the foundation's American saltine. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1027.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1032.12s)]
*  You got awarded zero points on that. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1034.12s)]
*  Caroline, one point for you for the grandmother jab. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1036.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1039.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1040.12s)]
*  This is ridiculous. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1041.12s)]
*  The second question is for you, Caroline. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1042.12s)]
*  And remember, contestants, you can actually, you know, debate a point that she's going [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1043.12s)]
*  to make. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1047.12s)]
*  If you want to, this is an open debate. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1048.12s)]
*  All right. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1050.12s)]
*  Then I disagree and I say no. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1051.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1053.12s)]
*  But we haven't even, we haven't gotten to the question yet here. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1054.12s)]
*  Caroline, which video game character would you choose as your running mate and why? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1056.12s)]
*  You know, any character that is a woman. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1063.12s)]
*  Because I think it's time that we have women. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1069.12s)]
*  She's feminist farming. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1075.12s)]
*  That's also words that he just learned backstage. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1078.12s)]
*  So he just learned what the word feminist is. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1082.12s)]
*  No, I think he knows that one. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1084.12s)]
*  He hangs out with kick streamers sometimes. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1085.12s)]
*  I've never hung out with a kick streamer. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1089.12s)]
*  I don't know what you're talking about. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1090.12s)]
*  Okay, look, you're 12. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1091.12s)]
*  Is he even allowed to be here? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1093.12s)]
*  He's like 12 years old. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1095.12s)]
*  Caroline, you have 10 more seconds to finish your point. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1096.12s)]
*  Which character? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1098.12s)]
*  So honestly, any woman in a game? [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1099.12s)]
*  Because, I mean. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1104.12s)]
*  At least say the game. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1107.12s)]
*  Really? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1108.12s)]
*  Can I hear it for women? [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1109.12s)]
*  She's feminist farming. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1113.12s)]
*  I can't really disagree with that one, man. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1116.12s)]
*  I love me some girls. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1118.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1119.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1120.12s)]
*  That was pretty good. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1121.12s)]
*  Caroline, points to you. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1122.12s)]
*  What? [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1123.12s)]
*  That's points? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1124.12s)]
*  That's feminism. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1125.12s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1126.12s)]
*  Hey, this is why you're not with your girlfriend anymore. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1127.12s)]
*  We can't be using that. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1130.12s)]
*  All right, you know what? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1132.12s)]
*  My producer, Tom in my ear, is saying that that's such a banger question. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1133.12s)]
*  Jason, you're going to get the same exact one. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1136.12s)]
*  Which video game character would you choose as your running mate and why? [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1138.12s)]
*  You have 40 seconds. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1141.12s)]
*  My running mate? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1142.12s)]
*  To be president. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1144.12s)]
*  The president is the leader of the country. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1146.12s)]
*  I know what that is, Hassan. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1149.12s)]
*  If I were to statistically calculate this in my head, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1151.12s)]
*  sophisticatedly speaking, I'd probably pick Aaron Yeager. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1156.12s)]
*  Elaborate. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1161.12s)]
*  Let me get a point for that one. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1164.12s)]
*  Elaborate. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1165.12s)]
*  I mean, look, at the end of the day, it's night, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1167.12s)]
*  and whenever the climax reaches its peak, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1172.12s)]
*  Aaron was a great leader. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1177.12s)]
*  Some would say even the best. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1180.12s)]
*  Okay, you're out of time, Jason. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1183.12s)]
*  That was horrible. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1185.12s)]
*  Other Jason, Nick Pallum. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1188.12s)]
*  Yep, that's what my mom calls me. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1190.12s)]
*  Hopefully you won't disappoint. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1192.12s)]
*  Oh, I know what she calls you. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1194.12s)]
*  I know what she calls me, too. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1196.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1198.12s)]
*  Am I just going to be reading rows to this whole thing? [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1199.12s)]
*  Yeah, she calls 911 to get away from you. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1201.12s)]
*  Points for a seer on that. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1204.12s)]
*  All right, Nick Pallum. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1205.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1206.12s)]
*  Which video game character would you choose [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1207.12s)]
*  as your running mate and why? [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1209.12s)]
*  Am I trying to win? [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1211.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1212.12s)]
*  Okay, well, then I'm picking Sonic, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1213.12s)]
*  because he's faster than everybody. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1214.12s)]
*  Oh. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1216.12s)]
*  Do you think speed plays a significant role in speed? [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1219.12s)]
*  You said running mate. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1223.12s)]
*  Like... [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1224.12s)]
*  Do you think it's a foot race, like, as the president? [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1226.12s)]
*  Wait, president? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1229.12s)]
*  I thought you were going running. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1230.12s)]
*  Like, your running mate is when you're running. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1231.12s)]
*  Oh. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1234.12s)]
*  For president. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1235.12s)]
*  Oh, Aaron Yeager, then, like what Jason said. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1236.12s)]
*  So we're stealing answers. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1239.12s)]
*  Yep. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1242.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1243.12s)]
*  Do I get points? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1244.12s)]
*  No. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1245.12s)]
*  No. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1246.12s)]
*  Baby, no money. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1247.12s)]
*  Please save this one. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1248.12s)]
*  Which video game character would you choose [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1250.12s)]
*  as your running mate and why? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1252.12s)]
*  I mean, I'm thinking, without question, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1253.12s)]
*  I'd probably go with Kirby, because, you know, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1255.12s)]
*  sometimes you just want to eat. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1257.12s)]
*  Sometimes you just want to suck down your opponent. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1259.12s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1262.12s)]
*  The only thing that matters is if you can change [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1264.12s)]
*  and shape-shift to what matters politically at that moment. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1266.12s)]
*  And if you want to take and make the right decision, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1270.12s)]
*  you got to think and be the right person. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1272.12s)]
*  Kirby, baby. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1275.12s)]
*  Points, points. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1276.12s)]
*  Oh, hell no. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1277.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1279.12s)]
*  Since Jason and other Jason are having a hard time, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1280.12s)]
*  I'm going to ask you guys this upcoming question. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1285.12s)]
*  Jason first, Jason the Ween. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1287.12s)]
*  What would you make the national snack [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1289.12s)]
*  of the United States and why? [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1292.12s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1295.12s)]
*  Probably would be, if I were to logically think about this, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1296.12s)]
*  I would... [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1301.12s)]
*  Stop filibustering. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1302.12s)]
*  Come on. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1303.12s)]
*  Pick it up. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1304.12s)]
*  Define filibuster. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1305.12s)]
*  We're not doing that. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1307.12s)]
*  Continue. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1308.12s)]
*  The national food would probably be [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1309.12s)]
*  a fudak bit. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1313.12s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1315.12s)]
*  Yeah, that's my shit right there. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1316.12s)]
*  Okay, the races are not going to like that one. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1319.12s)]
*  But that's cool. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1323.12s)]
*  All right, why? [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1324.12s)]
*  When you slurp a noodle up, what do you think of? [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1326.12s)]
*  Am I right, guys? [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1330.12s)]
*  I think of home. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1332.12s)]

*  Okay. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1335.12s)]
*  Nick Pallum. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1336.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1337.12s)]
*  What would you make the national snack [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1338.12s)]
*  of the United States and why? [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1339.12s)]
*  Wait, do we have one currently? [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1341.12s)]
*  What? [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1343.12s)]
*  Do we have one currently? [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1344.12s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1345.12s)]
*  Okay, national snack of the United States? [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1346.12s)]
*  Apples. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1349.12s)]
*  Why? [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1350.12s)]
*  Fuck no. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1351.12s)]
*  Because I think we need to eat healthier. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1352.12s)]
*  My man's running on the RFK Junior platform. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1355.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1360.12s)]
*  Yep. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1361.12s)]
*  All right, you know what? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1362.12s)]
*  Points it. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1363.12s)]
*  Yes, I got some points. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1364.12s)]
*  I like that, Caroline. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1365.12s)]
*  We do need to eat healthy. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1366.12s)]
*  You look dapper today. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1367.12s)]

*  Thank you, thank you. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1369.12s)]
*  I just... [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1370.12s)]
*  Point for that. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1371.12s)]
*  There you go. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1372.12s)]
*  All right, feeling good. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1373.12s)]
*  I think that's a good way to get your guys understanding. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1374.12s)]
*  This is how I'm dishing out the points. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1375.12s)]
*  It is not all that serious. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1376.8s)]
*  Anyway, okay. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1379.12s)]
*  Next question is for Seir. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1381.1999999999998s)]
*  To the critics that say Fortnite is dead, how would you reinvent and revitalize the [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1384.6799999999998s)]
*  game? [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1391.1999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1392.1999999999998s)]
*  I was actually excited to answer this question about Fortnite, the game. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1393.1999999999998s)]
*  I played a lot of Fortnite and it ain't dead. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1399.04s)]
*  You see, back in 1970s... [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1404.04s)]
*  Seir, I'm going to have to stop you there because we have officially reached our first [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1407.04s)]
*  milestone at $10,000. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1411.04s)]
*  There we go, there we go. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1414.04s)]
*  Thank God that milestone came in. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1416.04s)]
*  Permission to mime. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1418.04s)]
*  Granted. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1421.04s)]
*  Okay, now you can keep going, Seir. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1422.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1427.04s)]
*  So I think while Fortnite is very... [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1428.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1434.04s)]
*  So I think it's important to discuss how Fortnite has affected the corn industry. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1435.04s)]
*  Now, big corn is a big part of my life growing up and it's a big part of the foundation of [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1442.04s)]
*  America. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1449.04s)]
*  Now... [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1450.04s)]
*  How will you revitalize Fortnite with corn? [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1453.04s)]
*  And by corn, do you mean like the way TikTokers use it or are you talking about the food? [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1456.04s)]
*  I'm talking about the food, high fructose corn syrup. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1463.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1466.04s)]
*  Now, I'm saying what we do is we put that in a drink and we brand it maybe a sports [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1467.04s)]
*  beverage. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1472.04s)]
*  Kind of like that Prime drink and we put the Fortnite characters on it. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1473.04s)]
*  Have them do the dances. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1478.04s)]
*  What's the dance called? [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1479.04s)]
*  The Fortnite dance? [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1481.04s)]
*  What's the dance called? [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1482.04s)]
*  Seir, that's a mime. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1485.04s)]
*  He doesn't speak. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1486.04s)]
*  Yep. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1487.04s)]
*  So we get the character on there and we sell to all the youngins out there and we'll [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1488.04s)]
*  syrup it up. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1494.04s)]
*  Corn, Fortnite, hand in hand, all come together. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1495.04s)]
*  So you agree with that, huh? [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1498.04s)]
*  Okay, points. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1501.04s)]
*  Congratulations, Seir. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1502.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1505.04s)]
*  Let's get back to Jason the Ween. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1506.04s)]
*  Jason. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1509.04s)]
*  Get the away from me, bro. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1510.04s)]
*  Jason, do not disturb the mime. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1515.04s)]
*  Jason, what place or landmark, real or fiction, would you make protected federal land like [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1519.04s)]
*  a national park? [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1527.04s)]
*  Repeat the question. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1529.04s)]
*  I didn't hear. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1534.04s)]
*  I didn't hear. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1535.04s)]
*  What place? [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1536.04s)]
*  I just got to breathe the hell of hard in my ear. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1537.04s)]
*  What place or landmark, real or fictional, would you make protected federal land? [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1538.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1545.04s)]
*  I mean, if you were to sophisticatedly think about the situation, about where America is [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1547.04s)]
*  planted, I'd probably go with... [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1557.04s)]
*  All right, thank you, Nondrej, for... [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1564.04s)]
*  Seaside Bakery. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1566.04s)]
*  Incredible. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1569.04s)]
*  Thank you for your incredible performance, Nondrej. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1570.04s)]
*  Jason, I did not hear what your answer was. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1572.04s)]
*  I was just trying to save you by saying the mime, you're free to leave if you would like [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1574.04s)]
*  to. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1578.04s)]
*  If you want to stay, you can, but you're free. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1579.04s)]
*  You're making me uncomfortable. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1581.04s)]
*  Jason, answer the question. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1585.04s)]
*  He's crying. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1587.04s)]
*  Jason. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1588.04s)]
*  I'm a minor. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1589.04s)]
*  Oh. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1591.04s)]
*  Nondrej, he's not a minor. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1592.04s)]
*  Jason, answer the question. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1594.04s)]
*  Like I said before, I'd probably go with the city of Arlington. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1599.04s)]
*  That's... [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1606.04s)]
*  You would make the city of Arlington a protected federal land? [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1607.04s)]
*  I'd probably go with... [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1613.04s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1615.04s)]
*  I'd probably go with, logically, I'd have to go with Mount Rushmore. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1617.04s)]
*  That... [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1626.04s)]
*  Okay, points for knowing what Mount Rushmore is. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1627.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1634.04s)]
*  All right, we're going to ask that same question to the critics that say, Fortnite is dead. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1635.04s)]
*  How would you reinvent and revitalize the game? [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1643.04s)]
*  Bibi, no money. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1645.04s)]
*  You have the floor. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1646.04s)]
*  Unfortunately, I'm going to have to agree with Cyr. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1647.04s)]
*  It's all about the corn. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1649.04s)]
*  I see you over there, my brother man. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1651.04s)]
*  My brother man. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1653.04s)]
*  We couldn't use a man like you over in Ohio. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1654.04s)]
*  I'm over here. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1656.04s)]
*  I'm literally in Ohio. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1657.04s)]
*  I don't know where you are, but you're close to corn. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1659.04s)]
*  Alex, your accent is changing. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1663.04s)]
*  I don't know what's happening. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1664.04s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1665.04s)]
*  You're Canadian. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1666.04s)]
*  We got corn syrup and we have maple syrup, but corn makes more money than maple syrup. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1667.04s)]
*  And when you have corn, you have gamers. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1674.04s)]
*  And when you have gamers, you have Fortnite. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1677.04s)]
*  And what matters more than Fortnite, corn, and gamers? [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1680.04s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1684.04s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, I will solve all the answers to every single one of your problems [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1685.04s)]
*  if you just drink canola oil and play Fortnite. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1689.04s)]
*  Okay, somehow that's a point for Cyr. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1692.04s)]
*  I owe you one. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1695.04s)]
*  You do. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1697.04s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, and ebbs, that will be the end of round one, according [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1698.04s)]
*  to my producer, Tom, in my ear. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1702.04s)]
*  Let's look at the point totals after the first round. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1705.04s)]
*  Okay, the standings are as follows. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1710.04s)]
*  Caroline Kwan is in first place tied with Cyr somehow. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1714.04s)]
*  She didn't even answer the last question. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1718.04s)]
*  Okay, I only got one question because I was in the lead and clearly men need advantage, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1720.04s)]
*  so. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1725.04s)]
*  Shut up. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1726.04s)]
*  Well, BB No Mini made a compelling case for corn and Fortnite, which was Cyr's point, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1727.04s)]
*  so I had to give that to Cyr. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1733.04s)]
*  NMP, LOL, I guess technically second place with two points, also tied with Jason the [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1735.04s)]
*  Ween in second place. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1742.04s)]
*  BB No Games, also known as BB No Money, our Canadian contestant, is sitting in last place [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1745.04s)]
*  with one point. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1751.04s)]
*  This is a game that anyone can win. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1752.04s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, now before we get to our next round, let's check in with Austin [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1755.04s)]
*  and Will. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1760.04s)]
*  Thanks, Hassan. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1762.04s)]
*  Thanks, Hassan. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1765.04s)]
*  Will, there is so much to break down from that first round. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1766.04s)]
*  But, chat, we want to hear from you first. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1769.04s)]
*  Ignore that piece of Hassan, whatever he had to do in that first round. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1772.04s)]
*  In your own opinion, who won that round? [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1776.04s)]
*  Vote now by typing 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 in the chat to vote for your favorite. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1779.04s)]
*  So if you think Cyr 1, type 1, Caroline type 2, Jason type 3, NMP 4, and BB No Money 5. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1785.04s)]
*  That's right, Austin. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1794.04s)]
*  You know, fascinating. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1796.04s)]
*  We are starting to see some very definitive debate tactics emerging here in this first round. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1797.04s)]
*  Cyr clearly lobbying for big corn. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1804.04s)]
*  I don't think he really cares if he wins. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1807.04s)]
*  He's trying to really push that lobby. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1809.04s)]
*  Caroline Kwan leveraging that uterus and her estrogen to the absolute max, getting the women on board. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1811.04s)]
*  Jason the Ween, a sophisticated, think about it, stall filibuster technique, I believe it's called. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1819.04s)]
*  Very interesting there. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1827.04s)]
*  NMP kind of just bumming everyone out like Eeyore, making the crowd feel bad for him. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1829.04s)]
*  And last, BB No Money, just actually debating. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1835.04s)]
*  Just being a really good debater. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1840.04s)]
*  He's doing a fantastic job. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1842.04s)]
*  Let me tell you something though. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1844.04s)]
*  Caroline's standing out to me. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1845.04s)]
*  Yes, I mean, she looks like a Democratic candidate. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1847.04s)]
*  She does look like a Democratic, and I think it's time for change and it's time for a woman. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1850.04s)]
*  I'm just hearing now, Will, though, that the poll results are locked. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1853.04s)]
*  And the winner of the first round, according to the chat, with the most votes is... [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1857.04s)]
*  Jason the Ween! [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1866.04s)]
*  Jason the Ween! [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1867.04s)]
*  Congratulations, Jason. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1869.04s)]
*  You've been awarded two points as the People's Champion. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1871.04s)]
*  And look at him graciously accept that award. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1874.04s)]
*  Let's take a look at those updated standings. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1877.04s)]
*  Jason Ween in the lead with four points, followed by Caroline Kwan with three points. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1879.04s)]
*  Seer with three, Nick with two, and BB No Money with one point. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1886.04s)]
*  Nick, you have a complaint? [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1889.04s)]
*  Jason is also live, and his whole chat came in and voted for him. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1891.04s)]
*  That is unfair. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1895.04s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1897.04s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1898.04s)]
*  I saw it happen. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1899.04s)]
*  Someone mute his mic. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1900.04s)]
*  We're going to have to look at the tape to see if that happened. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1902.04s)]
*  It was brigaded. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1905.04s)]
*  Look, folks, I want to say thank you to all the donations so far. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1906.04s)]
*  We hit our first milestone during that round to unleash the mime. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1911.04s)]
*  Folks, keep the donations coming. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1917.04s)]
*  Our next milestone is the Pudding Cup Challenge. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1920.04s)]
*  Oh, man. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1924.04s)]
*  Oh, brother. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1925.04s)]
*  Nick, I trust you're going to clear that one, Nick. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1926.04s)]
*  The Pudding Cup Challenge. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1930.04s)]
*  All right. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1932.04s)]
*  Let's see real quick, Will, how close we are to hitting that goal. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1933.04s)]
*  Sure. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1936.04s)]
*  While we're looking at this, can I just say, Nandre was a shockingly good mime. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1937.04s)]
*  We're close to the goal, I think, Will. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1941.04s)]
*  Are we? [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1945.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1946.04s)]
*  Because that's just a QR code. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1947.04s)]
*  I know. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1948.04s)]
*  That's what they... [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1949.04s)]
*  I can't gauge where we are with that. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1950.04s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1952.04s)]
*  I have no further information, but we're really close. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1953.04s)]
*  Can you just read QR codes? [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1955.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1958.04s)]
*  I think the last guy they had for this gig could read QR codes. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1959.04s)]
*  Oh, got it, got it, got it, got it. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1962.04s)]
*  Yes, it was an incredible talent. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1963.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1965.04s)]
*  Unfortunately, he canceled last minute. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1966.04s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1967.04s)]
*  But, folks, use this QR code. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1968.04s)]
*  Your phone can read it. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1969.04s)]
*  We need your help to make sure we hit all of these milestones throughout the night. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1970.04s)]
*  If you're in the crowd here or at home, scan the QR code on the screen or type out the URL. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1973.04s)]
*  All of the money raised tonight is going to a few great causes. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1979.04s)]
*  I'll tell you what. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1983.04s)]
*  Let's do a quick speed milestone. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1984.04s)]
*  All right. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1986.04s)]
*  If we hit $200 right now, we'll give away T-shirts to the crowd. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1987.04s)]
*  All right. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1990.04s)]
*  Everybody loves a T-shirt. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1991.04s)]
*  Who wants a T-shirt? [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1992.04s)]
*  I want one. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1993.04s)]
*  Me, too. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1994.04s)]

*  All right. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1996.04s)]
*  Last time we did this, I actually showed you a T-shirt. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=1997.04s)]
*  I'm going to give it to you. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2000.04s)]
*  I'm going to give it to you. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2001.04s)]

*  I'm going to give it to you. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2004.04s)]
*  I'm going to give it to you. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2005.04s)]
*  Last time we did this, I actually shot a light out at TwitchCon, so I am no longer allowed [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2006.04s)]
*  to use the T-shirt. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2012.04s)]
*  Looks like we hit the goal. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2013.04s)]
*  My God, that was fast. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2014.04s)]
*  Already. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2015.04s)]
*  $200. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2016.04s)]
*  Who wants a T-shirt? [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2017.04s)]

*  Get on your feet. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2019.04s)]
*  Get on your feet. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2020.04s)]

*  All right. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2026.04s)]
*  All right. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2029.04s)]
*  I hear they actually execute ne'er-do-wells at Disneyland with a T-shirt cannon. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2031.04s)]
*  That's it. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2037.04s)]
*  That's morbid. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2040.04s)]

*  I would also like a T-shirt. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2046.04s)]
*  Could you get us a couple of T-shirts? [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2047.04s)]
*  I wonder what's on it. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2049.04s)]
*  Me? [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2051.04s)]
*  I do. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2052.04s)]
*  I want Hasanabi Debate Lords. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2053.04s)]
*  All right, folks. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2056.04s)]
*  Everybody got a T-shirt? [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2058.04s)]
*  All right. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2061.04s)]
*  All right. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2063.04s)]
*  Hasan, everybody got a T-shirt. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2065.04s)]
*  That was so fun. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2067.04s)]
*  I love a T-shirt. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2068.04s)]
*  It was very good. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2069.04s)]
*  Back to you, Hasan. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2070.04s)]
*  Let's start round number two. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2071.04s)]
*  Thank you, Austin and Will. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2073.04s)]
*  The next round is called Polling Errors, and this time I'm going to tell you, the contestants, [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2075.04s)]
*  what position you're arguing, or rather, chat is going to tell you what positions you're arguing. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2082.04s)]
*  The way this will work is we will poll chat for each of the topics. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2088.04s)]
*  The answers will be ranked one through five based on the poll results. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2093.04s)]
*  I'll assign you a position to argue, and you will each have to strenuously defend it. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2097.04s)]
*  That means you're going to have to defend it really hard, Jason. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2102.04s)]
*  That's what strenuously means. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2105.04s)]
*  For example, because you're in last place, we will let you speak on behalf of chat's top choice. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2107.04s)]
*  If you're in first place, you have to defend chat's bottom choice, which means Jason is going to have to defend chat's bottom choice. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2112.04s)]
*  Chat, are you ready? [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2122.04s)]
*  The first question is, what is the goaded Twitch meta? [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2126.04s)]
*  Is it sleep? [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2133.04s)]
*  Is it Rust? [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2135.04s)]
*  Is it Grand Theft Auto roleplay? [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2137.04s)]
*  Is it reality TV reacts? [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2139.04s)]
*  Or is it hot tubs? [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2141.04s)]
*  Type one, two, three, four, or five in the chat now to vote. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2144.04s)]
*  You have 30 seconds. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2148.04s)]
*  Will, what's your favorite meta? [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2151.04s)]
*  There was one glorious night where Twitch on-band Artistic Nudity, and it was called Titmuss, and man, did I enjoy myself. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2153.04s)]
*  Let me tell you, Will, I think if we all at once got naked, they couldn't stop us. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2162.04s)]
*  I feel like we could really do some civil dissidence. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2167.04s)]
*  We could do the sexiest sit-in you've ever seen. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2172.04s)]
*  Absolutely. They wouldn't expect it. They'd have no choice. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2179.04s)]
*  Well, anyway, enough fantasizing about us naked. Here are the poll results. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2182.04s)]
*  Oh, wow, hot tubs. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2187.04s)]
*  All right. Here are the final results, everybody. Hot tubs, predictably at 55% in the top slot. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2189.04s)]
*  Grand Theft Auto roleplay at 18% in second place, but not even close. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2196.04s)]
*  Wait a minute. I just lost the poll results. I don't know what's going on. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2201.04s)]
*  Now they're all at zero points. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2204.04s)]
*  Hot tubs. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2206.04s)]
*  Tom, Tom, you're recounting me. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2207.04s)]
*  There were some hanging chats. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2209.04s)]
*  That's right. They called for a recount. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2211.04s)]
*  There was an election interference happening. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2213.04s)]
*  Goddamn mail-in ballots. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2217.04s)]
*  That's right. Ballot harvesting. That's what happened. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2219.04s)]
*  I saw what happened to a couple of brave patriots. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2221.04s)]
*  All right, we're back. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2224.04s)]
*  Okay. Reality TV reacts at 16%, which is shocking because that's all I used to do. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2226.04s)]
*  Holy, this chat is so dynamic. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2232.04s)]
*  Rust at fourth place at 6% and Sleep also at 6%, which I think is a weak meta. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2234.04s)]
*  I don't even know if that's a meta at all. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2241.04s)]
*  All right. On that note, Jason The Ween, as the top contender at the moment, [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2243.04s)]
*  you are going to have to defend Sleep as a meta. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2248.04s)]
*  Why is Sleep the top meta? [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2251.04s)]
*  Well, being something you do every day. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2254.04s)]
*  True. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2259.04s)]
*  A lot of the times, one of my friends actually, Silky, he does a lot of sleep streams with his girlfriend. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2261.04s)]
*  Shout out to Victoria and Silky. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2268.04s)]
*  They love doing sleep streams, and I tune in every single time. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2273.04s)]
*  I'm actually going to do a sleep stream after this phase. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2276.04s)]
*  We love doing nap segments. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2280.04s)]
*  Okay, we're moving on from Jason. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2285.04s)]
*  Let's go to a popular one, the hot tub meta. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2289.04s)]
*  Now, for the most popular one, BB Nominee, you are at the bottom of the barrel currently, unfortunately. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2292.04s)]
*  So I hope you're going to be able to defend this one. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2297.04s)]
*  Why are hot tubs the top meta at Twitch? [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2299.04s)]
*  Well, Hassan, I know you work out regularly. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2303.04s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you for noticing. Points. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2306.04s)]
*  Chat and all the people here, thank you guys all for coming down and listening to Hassan talk and be his manly, beautiful self. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2314.04s)]
*  Chat is no longer voting, by the way, after the first round. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2321.04s)]
*  I don't need to check to help me win this one. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2324.04s)]
*  But who? [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2327.04s)]
*  Man, this is my time to talk. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2330.04s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2333.04s)]
*  The only time that you're going to be able to potentially see Hassan almost fully nude, hot tub stream. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2334.04s)]
*  Okay, another point for you. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2346.04s)]
*  Not only did I study kinesiology before I became a professional debater, but 15 minutes of hot tubbing, 10 to 15 minutes of hot tubbing will help you sleep, make your body stronger, more relaxed. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2349.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2364.04s)]
*  All right, that's enough. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2365.04s)]
*  You're now just describing the benefits of hot tubs. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2366.04s)]
*  Nick Pallum. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2369.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2370.04s)]
*  You are currently in last place after the fantastic performance put by BB Nominee. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2371.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2374.04s)]
*  So you have to defend Grand Theft Auto role play as the top meta. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2375.04s)]
*  So go on and tell them about all your concubines in that digital pixel world. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2382.04s)]
*  Tell them about that pixel pussy that you storing in there. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2389.04s)]
*  So GTRP, thank you. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2393.04s)]
*  GTRP is a good meta for a lot of reasons. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2396.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2400.04s)]
*  Number one, you get to meet a lot of new people and do things you don't normally do. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2401.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2406.04s)]
*  And then sometimes you get to meet those people in real life. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2407.04s)]
*  How many whores you got locked up in there? [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2410.04s)]
*  And then sometimes you accidentally put a hand on a hip and everything goes downhill. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2413.04s)]
*  And now you're a lonely man. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2418.04s)]
*  Yeah, but listen, best meta, you know, everyone gets to play, everyone gets to have fun, everyone gets to pretend, you know. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2420.04s)]
*  And the best thing about Twitch is bringing people together. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2425.04s)]
*  And that's exactly what GTRP is. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2428.04s)]
*  All right, Nick. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2429.04s)]
*  That's two points for you for that one. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2430.04s)]
*  One extra point because, you know, help me. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2433.04s)]
*  You need it. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2437.04s)]
*  Hassan. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2438.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2439.04s)]
*  Now at the number two slot, we have Rust. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2441.04s)]
*  Caroline Kwan, defend the Rust meta. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2447.04s)]
*  Thank you so much for that question. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2451.04s)]
*  I just want to say everybody who picked Rust, it was a beautiful choice. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2453.04s)]
*  And you should feel so good about yourselves for picking that. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2457.04s)]
*  So Rust is really a metaphor for life because things happen in that place that you're not always prepared for. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2463.04s)]
*  Boys, I bet you she's going to bring up women again. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2479.04s)]
*  It teaches you that even when there are women in the game like Cutie Cinderella, oh, wow, who blew me up and sold me into sex trafficking, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2482.04s)]
*  I realized that I forgave her because I'm out here fighting for all women, even when they sell me into sex trafficking and rust. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2496.04s)]
*  So it was a game that taught me a lot about myself and life and women. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2506.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2513.04s)]
*  All right. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2515.04s)]
*  So much. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2517.04s)]
*  Why did she talk like that? [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2518.04s)]
*  Because Caroline filibustered the entire conversation. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2519.04s)]
*  We're going to have to skip the last meta and move on to topic number two. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2522.04s)]
*  But, Cyr, I will be starting off with you no matter what. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2526.04s)]
*  You get no points. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2529.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2532.04s)]
*  Next question. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2533.04s)]
*  Deserved. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2534.04s)]
*  Next question, Chad. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2535.04s)]
*  What is the greatest game console of all time? [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2537.04s)]
*  At number one, we have PS2. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2541.04s)]
*  At number two, we have Nintendo 64. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2544.04s)]
*  At number three, Sega Dreamcast. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2546.04s)]
*  Number four, Xbox 360. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2549.04s)]
*  And number five, we have Wii. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2551.04s)]
*  Type one, two, three, or four, or five in the chat to now vote. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2553.04s)]
*  You have 30 seconds, Chad, Austin, and Will. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2558.04s)]
*  How did you feel about that performance last round before we ask you about your top console? [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2561.04s)]
*  Well, you know, Hassan, I think, you know, Caroline, again, [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2566.04s)]
*  she really tugged on my emotional heartstrings. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2570.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2574.04s)]
*  She really did. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2575.04s)]
*  I think I cried a little bit. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2576.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2577.04s)]
*  It was deep. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2578.04s)]
*  It was profound. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2579.04s)]
*  What about you, Will? [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2580.04s)]
*  Who really touched you? [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2581.04s)]
*  Oh, man, you know, it's interesting to see Cyr really go on the attack in that second round. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2582.04s)]
*  You don't hear pixel pussy often as just a combination of words. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2588.04s)]
*  And he really went there. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2594.04s)]
*  He really did. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2595.04s)]
*  Yes, he did. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2596.04s)]
*  What are your top console choices? [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2597.04s)]
*  Let me tell you, Hassan, I've always been a fan of the Wii. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2599.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2603.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2604.04s)]
*  And I believe to my core that the Dreamcast is the greatest system ever made by man. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2605.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2612.04s)]
*  Visual memory cards. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2613.04s)]
*  All right. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2614.04s)]
*  The controller, Jet Set Radio. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2615.04s)]
*  All right. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2618.04s)]
*  The poll results are here, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2619.04s)]
*  Will Neff chose the Boomer console and Austin chose the console most beloved by the elderly. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2621.04s)]
*  You hate the old man. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2627.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2628.04s)]
*  All right. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2629.04s)]
*  Poll results are in. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2630.04s)]
*  At the top slot is PlayStation 2, which makes the most sense at 41%. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2631.04s)]
*  Second slot for Xbox 360 at 22%. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2635.04s)]
*  Wii is in the third place with 17%. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2639.04s)]
*  Nintendo 64 at 15% and Dreamcast at 5%. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2641.04s)]
*  So let's get started. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2646.04s)]
*  I'm going to treat Seer as though he has the least amount of points, even though they are all tied right now. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2648.04s)]
*  Seer, Caroline and Bibi no money and give you the goaded console PlayStation 2, which objectively is the goaded console. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2654.04s)]
*  Why is that the top console Seer? [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2661.04s)]
*  You look like you've been hitting the gym. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2671.04s)]
*  Now, let me ask you all a question. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2679.04s)]
*  That works once. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2683.04s)]
*  That only works once. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2684.04s)]
*  I was just seeing it from the coquero. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2685.04s)]
*  Now, what's better than PlayStation 1? [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2688.04s)]
*  PlayStation 2? [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2691.04s)]
*  There you have it. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2694.04s)]
*  But PlayStation 3 wasn't better than PlayStation 2, though. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2695.04s)]
*  Well, it's still better than PlayStation 1 and you answered the question and it is what it is. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2698.04s)]
*  And I don't think we should muzzy wuzzy fuzzy it was a bear. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2703.04s)]
*  Seer, why is PS2 the top console? [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2707.04s)]
*  Fool me once, shame on you. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2709.04s)]
*  Fool me twice. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2711.04s)]
*  You're not going to shame me. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2713.04s)]
*  Fool me again. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2715.04s)]
*  I personally love that reference because I'm 50 years old. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2719.04s)]
*  I don't know if the audience is going to be aware of that. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2722.04s)]
*  Points for you for the George W. Bush impersonation. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2724.04s)]
*  Go on. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2727.04s)]
*  Why is PS2 the top console? [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2728.04s)]
*  Now, here's the really good thing about it. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2731.04s)]
*  Okay, moving on from Seer. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2737.04s)]
*  He already got his points. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2739.04s)]
*  BB no money. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2741.04s)]
*  Xbox 360. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2744.04s)]
*  Why is it the top console? [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2746.04s)]
*  Everyone would probably agree here. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2748.04s)]
*  If you've ever played any Xbox games. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2752.04s)]
*  Halo. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2756.04s)]
*  Okay, thank you. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2760.04s)]
*  That's all I'm going to say. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2762.04s)]
*  That's all I need to say. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2764.04s)]
*  All right, moving on from BB no money. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2765.04s)]
*  Jason the Ween. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2767.04s)]
*  Actually, you know what? [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2769.04s)]
*  Let's do Caroline first. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2770.04s)]
*  This is going to be great. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2771.04s)]
*  Great. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2772.04s)]
*  Caroline. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2773.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2774.04s)]
*  Normally, I would be giving you we as the third slot since you're in the last place out of everyone here. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2775.04s)]
*  But I'm actually going to ask you about Nintendo 64 instead because it's definitely a console that you're very familiar with as a gamer. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2781.04s)]
*  Please tell us why Nintendo 64 is the top console. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2788.04s)]
*  She can. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2795.04s)]
*  It is. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2797.04s)]
*  It is when I was a little girl. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2799.04s)]
*  When I was a little girl. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2802.04s)]
*  When I was a little girl. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2804.04s)]
*  Growing up as a little girl. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2808.04s)]
*  And I played with my Nintendo 64. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2814.04s)]
*  Okay, I'm taking poison away for that one. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2821.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2823.04s)]
*  Not an answer. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2824.04s)]
*  Yeah, Hassan. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2825.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2826.04s)]
*  Man, man, man. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2827.04s)]
*  Feminism only takes you so far. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2828.04s)]
*  That'll be the end of round two, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2830.04s)]
*  You can't stop me. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2834.04s)]
*  Yes, I can. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2837.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2838.04s)]
*  I can mute you. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2839.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2840.04s)]
*  Let's look at the point totals after the second round. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2841.04s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, the point totals currently are as it stands. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2845.04s)]
*  Beep beep no money coming after a terrible debate performance early on at four points in the top slot, sharing that top slot with Nick Pallum, Jason DeWine at four points and also with Sear. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2849.04s)]
*  Whereas Caroline Kwan is now at the bottom by herself with two points. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2861.04s)]
*  I'm beginning to notice a trend that I did not intend to create here with all the men. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2865.04s)]
*  Nope. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2869.04s)]
*  Getting four points. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2870.04s)]
*  All alone can't feel myself inside. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2872.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2875.04s)]
*  Before we get to our next round, let's get back to our boys at the donation desk. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2876.04s)]
*  Will and Austin. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2881.04s)]
*  Wow. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2882.04s)]
*  Kind of a Freudian slip there from Hassan. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2883.04s)]
*  Really, really just. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2886.04s)]
*  Wage gapping the woman up there. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2888.04s)]
*  Really? [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2889.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2890.04s)]
*  You know, it's so interesting that he said that because I heard him backstage plotting this exact thing. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2891.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2896.04s)]
*  That's why I cut your mic. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2897.04s)]
*  That's right. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2898.04s)]
*  And gaze. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2899.04s)]
*  He hates him. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2900.04s)]
*  That's really I know. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2901.04s)]
*  And it's really starting to show in the running. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2902.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2904.04s)]
*  Chat. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2905.04s)]
*  Who won that round? [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2906.04s)]
*  Vote now by typing one, two, three, four or five to vote for your favorite. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2907.04s)]
*  If you think Sear one type one, Caroline to Jason DeWine. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2911.04s)]
*  Three and MP four and baby no money. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2916.04s)]
*  Five. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2919.04s)]
*  Who would you vote for? [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2920.04s)]
*  Will? [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2921.04s)]
*  Man, that was a tight round. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2922.04s)]
*  But, you know, I don't think Caroline got enough credit for that jazzy rendition. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2924.04s)]
*  I agree. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2928.04s)]
*  When I was a young girl playing her N sixty four. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2929.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2932.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2933.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2934.04s)]
*  No, I thought it was phenomenal. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2935.04s)]
*  She's a brilliant vocalist. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2936.04s)]
*  Yeah, truly. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2937.04s)]
*  It would make it even a better president. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2938.04s)]
*  I agree. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2940.04s)]
*  Who agrees with us? [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2941.04s)]
*  Maybe about 30 percent of the crowd. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2943.04s)]
*  And it seems like regardless of what the crowd is thinking, Austin and Will. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2946.04s)]
*  Yes, I believe we have our winner. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2950.04s)]
*  OK, all right. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2953.04s)]
*  All right. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2955.04s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, the poll results are locked and the winner is. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2956.04s)]
*  Caroline Kwan. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2961.04s)]
*  That's a few extra points for them. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2963.04s)]
*  So let's look at if that helps. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2967.04s)]
*  And my goodness, holy Lord, what a barn burner. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2970.04s)]
*  Four points for every single. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2975.04s)]
*  Competitor. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2977.04s)]
*  That's incredible. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2979.04s)]
*  And this crowd is absolutely on its feet. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2981.04s)]
*  They're wild right now. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2983.04s)]
*  People are hanging from the rafters. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2986.04s)]
*  It's getting louder. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2988.04s)]
*  Somebody gets security. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2989.04s)]
*  Now hold on, Will. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2991.04s)]
*  I'm being told. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2993.04s)]
*  I'm being told, as if it couldn't get any more exciting, [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=2999.04s)]
*  I'm being told we already hit another milestone. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3004.24s)]
*  Holy. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3006.94s)]
*  It's time for the pudding cup challenge. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3008.14s)]
*  Oh, Axel, what is that? [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3012.2s)]
*  Well, let me tell you, Will, without saying too much, [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3014.62s)]
*  I urge you to Google pudding fingers for some background. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3018.2s)]
*  I don't know what that could be. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3021.7599999999998s)]
*  I would turn on safe search first. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3022.6s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3024.36s)]
*  Definitely be careful. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3026.2s)]
*  Our debaters are lined up and ready. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3028.0s)]
*  They each have a cup of pudding [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3029.8s)]
*  and they have to eat it with their fingers. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3031.4s)]
*  The winner gets some extra points. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3033.68s)]
*  Who's your money on, Will? [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3035.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3037.72s)]
*  Well, look at... [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3038.56s)]
*  Gosh. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3040.4s)]
*  Pudding fingers sounds like something [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3042.24s)]
*  you get in a bar in West Hollywood. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3043.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3045.52s)]
*  Ooh. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3046.36s)]
*  Fucking. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3047.2s)]
*  Ooh, all right. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3048.04s)]
*  All right. Ready? [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3050.8s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3051.96s)]
*  On three. Oh, God. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3052.8s)]
*  Three. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3054.64s)]
*  Two. Two. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3055.56s)]
*  One. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3056.52s)]
*  Go. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3057.44s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3059.12s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3060.64s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3061.48s)]
*  She's not even using her fingers. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3062.32s)]
*  Caroline. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3065.44s)]
*  I kind of respect that. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3066.28s)]
*  Nick has done this before. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3067.84s)]
*  And there goes Baby No Money. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3069.84s)]
*  With three fingers. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3071.44s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, he is a cunning linguist. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3072.28s)]
*  Wow. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3074.68s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3077.2000000000003s)]
*  Oh, look at him eat that. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3078.2400000000002s)]
*  I think he's done. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3079.08s)]
*  I think he's done. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3080.2400000000002s)]
*  No, I'm done. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3081.08s)]
*  I'm done. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3082.36s)]
*  Wait, is she done? [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3083.36s)]
*  Baby No Money finished that pudding in about 30 seconds [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3085.52s)]
*  and there's not a dry seat in the house. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3088.64s)]
*  There's corn in here. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3093.56s)]
*  That was Baby No Money by a landslide. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3094.56s)]
*  Chad, who do you think won? [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3097.44s)]
*  That was insane. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3098.88s)]
*  Make some noise if you think Baby No Money won. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3100.24s)]
*  Make some noise if you think Sear won. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3105.48s)]
*  All right, that's Baby No Money. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3109.24s)]
*  No, Baby No Money has it. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3110.44s)]
*  Baby No Money gets a point for that round. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3112.36s)]
*  Caroline, I'm subtracting a point from you [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3114.92s)]
*  for your lackluster performance. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3117.1600000000003s)]
*  And because you're a woman. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3120.92s)]
*  Thank God I don't have any stake in this game, Will. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3123.88s)]
*  It'd be really rough. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3126.32s)]
*  I will admit, Nick Pallin was a shocking disappointment. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3127.6400000000003s)]
*  He did all right. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3132.08s)]
*  I really thought he was gonna do it, [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3133.12s)]
*  but he's in his healthy arc. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3134.6s)]
*  He's on his healthy era. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3136.7200000000003s)]
*  Now folks, I'd like to thank all the donations so far. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3139.2000000000003s)]
*  That's right. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3143.12s)]
*  The next milestone is called [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3144.0s)]

*  No. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3158.32s)]
*  It could be a spaceship. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3159.52s)]
*  It could be a hot dog. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3161.04s)]
*  You never know. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3162.7200000000003s)]
*  Now folks, we need your help to make sure [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3164.48s)]

*  But before we can move on any further, [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3181.76s)]
*  we're gonna take a quick break. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3183.96s)]
*  So don't go anywhere. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3185.76s)]

*  Yeah, I think we need more Hassan. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3304.44s)]
*  Honestly, I don't think we've gotten enough yet. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3306.28s)]
*  Hassan, one more time. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3308.52s)]
*  Let those nips out. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3311.2s)]
*  Give these people what they want. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3312.52s)]
*  Now that's how you debate. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3314.68s)]
*  That's how you debate. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3316.48s)]
*  The gun show. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3318.16s)]
*  That's right. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3320.4s)]
*  All right, let's go to the expensive seats. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3321.52s)]
*  I'm just a piece of meat to everyone here. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3323.36s)]

*  Who's your favorite debater and why is it Seer? [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3328.48s)]
*  It's Caroline. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3331.76s)]
*  It's Caroline also? [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3332.76s)]
*  Well, say something nice about Seer too. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3334.92s)]
*  Seer is the best RP I've ever seen in my life. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3337.92s)]
*  You're goddamn right he is. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3340.52s)]
*  All right, that's live from the pit. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3343.48s)]

*  for our first challenge round, Hassan. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3359.1600000000003s)]
*  All right, thank you, Austin and Will. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3362.32s)]
*  To our contestants, we have a very special challenge round. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3365.56s)]
*  It's called Get Out the E-Mode. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3372.44s)]
*  That's right. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3375.04s)]
*  I am going to give our bottom two scorers right now [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3375.96s)]
*  a very special opportunity to catch up. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3379.96s)]
*  Unfortunately, however, everyone is kind of tied [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3383.04s)]
*  at the bottom with the exception of Caroline [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3386.24s)]
*  who has three points. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3388.44s)]
*  So Caroline, auto-lock on one of those contestants. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3389.52s)]
*  But for the second person, I choose Jason the Ween. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3393.68s)]
*  I'm ready, yo. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3399.7999999999997s)]
*  Oh damn, there's nobody. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3400.64s)]
*  Ain't nobody even clapped. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3401.96s)]
*  Okay, Caroline and Jason, for this challenge round, [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3406.0s)]
*  it is called Get Out the E-Mode. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3409.56s)]
*  It works like this. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3412.3199999999997s)]
*  Listen carefully, Jason. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3413.6s)]
*  You two are going head to head [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3415.56s)]
*  and you'll each have 45 seconds [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3417.8799999999997s)]
*  to describe your channel and community. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3419.8399999999997s)]

*  To give you a little bit of help, [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3427.68s)]

*  This one is mudslinging. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3568.6400000000003s)]
*  For this round, I want you all to do, [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3570.44s)]
*  I wanna do you all a little bit of favor. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3573.44s)]

*  and sling a little bit of mud, let loose on each other. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3579.12s)]
*  So it's time for some mudslinging. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3583.04s)]
*  This is going to be a straight-up debate, okay? [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3585.8s)]
*  Now, I'm gonna give you a topic. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3590.92s)]
*  It's obvious that everyone on the stage here [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3591.84s)]
*  would obviously be an awful president. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3595.6400000000003s)]
*  Maybe with the exception of Caroline, [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3598.36s)]
*  she's breaking the grass. Wait, that is not true. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3599.6000000000004s)]
*  I told you my policy, Sasan. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3601.0s)]
*  Definitely, I reiterate my position. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3603.6800000000003s)]
*  Everyone here would be a truly awful president, [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3606.32s)]
*  but who would be the worst president on stage and why? [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3608.4s)]
*  Let's start with Nick Pallum. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3614.96s)]
*  Okay, obviously I'd be the best president, [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3618.84s)]
*  but the worst president, Jason. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3622.08s)]
*  This dude has no idea what's going on. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3624.52s)]
*  He's TikTok brain. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3626.2400000000002s)]
*  Y'all want an old hag running the country [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3627.88s)]
*  or do you want a young, handsome Asian man? [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3629.96s)]
*  Come on now, y'all. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3633.6800000000003s)]
*  No, Jason, all Jason can do is meme. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3635.2400000000002s)]
*  Like, he just eats nothing, nothing. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3638.92s)]
*  No, I can run the country. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3640.88s)]
*  I have no kids yet. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3642.36s)]
*  Have you ever voted before? [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3644.2000000000003s)]
*  Yes, plenty, plenty of times. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3645.76s)]
*  I doubt it. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3648.52s)]
*  No, this guy has no shot at running the country. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3649.36s)]
*  It's up to him. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3651.88s)]
*  Everyone wake up, 30 minutes of TikTok. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3652.72s)]
*  Horrible. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3654.92s)]
*  Almost nap time, Ugg. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3655.7599999999998s)]
*  Nick, why do you think you'd be a better president [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3657.4s)]
*  than Jason? [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3659.32s)]
*  Oh, because I've already figured out. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3660.4s)]
*  Give us some of your policies. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3661.24s)]
*  I've figured out how to solve all these issues. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3662.08s)]
*  Let's hear it. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3664.56s)]
*  Okay, so I have this thing called Pallum-ism. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3665.52s)]
*  All right. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3667.96s)]
*  Okay. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3669.16s)]
*  Don't clap. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3670.0s)]
*  No, Pallum-ism, it's the way of the future. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3670.84s)]
*  It's a supercomputer that monitors everything. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3673.16s)]
*  Okay, we have unlimited resources because of dark matter. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3675.64s)]
*  Everyone will do exactly what they're told to do [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3679.48s)]
*  and there'll be no more problems, no more crime. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3681.12s)]
*  If you commit crimes, you get thrown into the grinder. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3682.92s)]
*  Ha ha. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3685.2400000000002s)]
*  Points for Jason. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3687.08s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3690.04s)]
*  For other Jason. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3690.88s)]
*  Nick Pallum. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3692.56s)]
*  Yes. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3693.4s)]
*  Okay. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3694.44s)]
*  Baby No Money, who do you think would be the worst [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3696.8s)]
*  president on this stage and why? [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3699.88s)]
*  I mean, I would probably be the worst president of America [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3702.68s)]
*  because I'm Canadian, so. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3705.6s)]
*  By default, doesn't really work that well, [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3709.04s)]
*  but from what I've seen, from the bird's eye view [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3713.12s)]
*  from sitting in Canada and watching America, [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3718.3199999999997s)]
*  I think someone who could run the country well, Mr. Korn. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3720.72s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3725.7999999999997s)]
*  I don't want to talk about someone who can't be president. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3726.7999999999997s)]
*  No, you're being way too Canadian right now. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3730.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm taking a point away from you. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3732.12s)]
*  You're supposed to be mugslinging. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3733.2s)]
*  Alex, what's wrong with you? [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3734.7999999999997s)]
*  Okay, point taken away from you. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3736.68s)]
*  Okay, Caroline, who would be the worst president [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3738.96s)]
*  on stage and why? [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3740.4s)]
*  So, here's the thing. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3741.24s)]
*  What does everybody on this stage have in common [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3742.92s)]
*  besides ill-fitting suits? [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3745.12s)]
*  They're old. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3747.12s)]
*  A hatred for you. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3748.84s)]
*  They're, they're all men. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3750.0s)]
*  Above the edge of 30. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3754.04s)]
*  So you name one, you name them all. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3755.12s)]
*  I can't even pick one because every one of them [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3757.36s)]
*  would be terrible and it's time for a new dawn, [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3760.12s)]
*  a new day, a new life for me. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3764.08s)]
*  All right, I'm meeting Caroline. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3769.7599999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3771.4s)]
*  Caroline, you're muted. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3773.92s)]
*  Cyr, who would be the worst president and why? [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3778.2799999999997s)]
*  Caroline. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3780.48s)]
*  Yeah, tell me why. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3782.2s)]
*  I think that she stands on the basis [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3783.4s)]
*  of everything that's evil in this country. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3785.84s)]
*  I think she wants to give the power to the women. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3789.28s)]
*  She wants them to vote and have credit cards. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3795.0800000000004s)]
*  Oh, you think she just fell out of a coconut tree. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3798.1200000000003s)]
*  Anyways, look at her. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3803.96s)]
*  I mean, I get that one, but. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3811.6400000000003s)]
*  Nick Pallum, subtracting a point from you for that one. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3815.0800000000004s)]
*  Come on. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3818.48s)]
*  Cyr, you get a point. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3819.32s)]

*  Well, I mean, he's old. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3835.12s)]
*  He needs to start a family. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3836.88s)]
*  Hair line is receding. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3838.6800000000003s)]
*  His suit doesn't even fit him. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3840.6400000000003s)]
*  Nah, I'm just playing. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3842.32s)]

*  Yeah, nah, I mean, yeah, that's me. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3847.52s)]
*  How old do you think is like old? [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3854.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm just curious. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3856.0400000000004s)]
*  I feel like once you've reached past like 20, not 29. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3857.8s)]
*  Can you mute his mic? [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3862.44s)]

*  I know you guys are narcissistic shimmers. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=3909.64s)]

*  Oh, well, isn't he an anchor baby? [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4194.26s)]
*  He's Turkish, right? [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4197.34s)]
*  Yes, but he was born in New Jersey, allegedly. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4198.38s)]
*  Allegedly. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4200.9s)]
*  But I'm thinking we should start a birther movement. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4201.74s)]

*  What? [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4376.06s)]
*  I definitely lost my IFB. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4380.1s)]
*  I'm deaf now. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4382.9400000000005s)]
*  Should I... [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4386.580000000001s)]
*  Oh, I should put on the harness. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4387.42s)]
*  Yowza. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4394.14s)]
*  Your IFB might be in the jacket [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4398.26s)]
*  that you tossed into the crowd. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4399.820000000001s)]
*  Sorry about that, Trix. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4403.1s)]
*  How is this? [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4407.06s)]
*  Oh. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4409.780000000001s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4416.9400000000005s)]
*  He's not putting that on. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4418.26s)]
*  Are you? [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4420.18s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4421.900000000001s)]
*  All right. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4432.740000000001s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4434.58s)]
*  while our beautiful hosts are putting on [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4435.66s)]
*  their gimp leather outfits, [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4437.3s)]
*  we are gonna move on to round four. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4439.14s)]
*  Round four is called PowerPoint to the People. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4443.82s)]
*  It's a team challenge as a matter of fact. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4447.94s)]
*  So we're gonna be splitting the debaters up, [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4449.82s)]
*  the top three scorers versus the bottom two. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4451.86s)]
*  I'll be scoring you individually throughout the round, [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4456.34s)]
*  but I'll give some extra bonus points to the better team. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4459.14s)]
*  The next topic involves some complicated monetary policy. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4464.26s)]
*  That's right. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4468.22s)]
*  I lied to you all when I said there's gonna be no politics. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4469.0599999999995s)]
*  Of course there's gonna be politics. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4470.98s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4474.1s)]
*  This is the only room that would ever cheer for that. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4474.94s)]
*  That's crazy at TwitchCon too. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4476.58s)]
*  That's why we asked you to create a PowerPoint presentation [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4478.78s)]
*  to share with the audience. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4486.0199999999995s)]
*  Thank you so much for doing that. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4488.74s)]
*  And by, you know, you, I mean, [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4490.74s)]
*  the producers made a PowerPoint [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4493.98s)]
*  and you guys are gonna have to freestyle off [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4495.42s)]
*  of what you see on your screen. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4497.66s)]
*  The first team is ready for the presentation. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4499.58s)]
*  Please walk us through your PowerPoint [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4502.3s)]
*  one slide at a time. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4504.54s)]
*  Each time the slide changes, the next person talks. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4507.0199999999995s)]
*  Okay, who would like to start? [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4511.26s)]
*  All right, Seer. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4515.179999999999s)]
*  Okay, are you ready? [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4517.34s)]
*  The federal budget deficit in 2024 is about $2 trillion. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4522.78s)]
*  How would you balance the budget? [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4526.14s)]
*  Go. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4528.02s)]
*  Now, in order to balance the budget, as you can see here, [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4528.94s)]
*  we got individual income taxes. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4532.14s)]
*  We got excise taxes. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4534.78s)]
*  We got corporation income taxes, [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4536.9s)]
*  other and social insurance and retirement receipts. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4539.82s)]
*  Very, very fun logistics. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4543.58s)]
*  Now, basically, this is what I'm gonna be doing [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4547.02s)]
*  in order to solve this. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4549.14s)]
*  So we're gonna take this triangle [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4550.1s)]
*  and we're gonna get it out of there. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4551.26s)]
*  That's the big problem is that triangle getting in there [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4553.22s)]
*  and just sort of, it's a conundrum [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4556.3s)]
*  and you'd think it fell out of a coconut tree. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4559.3s)]
*  Next person. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4564.26s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, this is us [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4567.98s)]
*  and we are presenting on Mo Money, Mo Problem. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4570.14s)]
*  As an individual that has had no money, [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4574.1s)]
*  his whole career and his whole life, [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4576.18s)]
*  I know how positive of an effect that has on you. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4578.700000000001s)]
*  So growing up in a family, in a household, [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4582.3s)]
*  all we were trying to do was effectively just put money [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4585.26s)]
*  house over our head, feed our stomachs and everything [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4588.860000000001s)]
*  and I am so, so deeply touched with how, because. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4593.22s)]
*  How would this balance the budget? [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4599.34s)]
*  The only thing that the budget has to do is less money. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4601.46s)]
*  Next slide. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4605.18s)]
*  Okay, moving on, maybe no money. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4606.02s)]
*  All right. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4607.9400000000005s)]
*  Seems to be some sort of contraption [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4611.06s)]
*  that you insert on your head. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4615.58s)]
*  Perhaps something to do with pigeons, I have no idea. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4617.820000000001s)]
*  It seems that you sophisticatedly place this on the head [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4620.740000000001s)]
*  and it feeds you information [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4623.9400000000005s)]
*  that seems to enhance the brain. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4627.46s)]
*  The short-term solution. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4632.34s)]
*  What's going on in the next slide there? [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4633.34s)]
*  What do you think is happening in the next contraption? [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4635.62s)]
*  Next person. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4638.46s)]
*  Back to you, Seir. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4641.46s)]
*  Now, we got the triangle out of the way [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4643.42s)]
*  and we decided to go and purchase some more triangles [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4645.82s)]
*  that were actually higher quality. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4647.9s)]
*  So portfolio, inventions, stores, stability, [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4649.58s)]
*  we ignore all that, we throw that out the window. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4652.86s)]
*  So we're gonna be focusing on a third quarter in particular. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4655.42s)]
*  Why? [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4658.86s)]
*  Well, PlayStation 1, PlayStation 2, [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4659.7s)]
*  PlayStation 3, ladies and gentlemen. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4661.5s)]
*  Brilliant. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4663.62s)]
*  We're gonna be spending $3,599 today. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4665.02s)]
*  All right, good job, Seir. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4667.9s)]
*  Okay, next slide. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4670.9s)]
*  Wheatgrass, ever had it? [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4673.74s)]
*  It's delicious. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4675.3s)]
*  Money, green, money goes up. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4676.66s)]
*  Something must be done. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4679.74s)]
*  We are doing it. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4681.06s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, everyone is watching this stream. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4682.42s)]
*  We are learning. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4685.06s)]
*  Bombs, big things in the sky. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4686.02s)]
*  Very important for financial growth and wealth, [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4688.42s)]
*  especially in ridiculously socioeconomic disparities. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4691.42s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, Trucks. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4695.42s)]
*  Baby, no money, you got a point. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4697.74s)]
*  Accountability, okay. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4699.18s)]
*  It seems to be Kermit the Frog, a dog. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4701.74s)]
*  That's not Kermit the Frog, okay. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4704.7s)]
*  Okay, but sometimes in life, [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4706.9800000000005s)]
*  you have to take accountability, okay. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4709.62s)]
*  I for one know that this is one of the biggest things [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4711.26s)]
*  if you wanna have a great relationship, okay. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4714.22s)]
*  Sometimes you need to take accountability [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4716.58s)]
*  of the things you did wrong in life. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4718.26s)]
*  I'm staying right at this guy right here. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4720.7s)]
*  Camera pan maybe? [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4724.099999999999s)]
*  No, okay. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4725.66s)]
*  Accountability. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4726.9s)]
*  Next slide. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4728.78s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4731.58s)]
*  but it's okay because a solution is possible. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4732.82s)]
*  So these are my relatives. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4735.46s)]
*  Ohio goes crazy. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4737.139999999999s)]
*  This is my mom, this is my dad, this is my sister. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4738.98s)]
*  That's my uncle and that's my other uncle. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4741.7s)]
*  Terrace, nah. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4743.54s)]
*  And that's gonna be the solution for that. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4747.5s)]
*  Next slide. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4751.46s)]
*  You ever been to Canada? [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4753.94s)]
*  Changed us to worst case Ontario. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4755.34s)]
*  Pokemon, I fucking love Pokemon. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4757.34s)]
*  That's a point for that. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4759.099999999999s)]
*  Plus sign, you guys were thinking it was all negative, [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4760.82s)]
*  but we have a fucking plus sign. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4764.26s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, whatever the hell this is, [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4765.74s)]
*  looks really cool and I could probably use it as sexually. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4767.38s)]
*  And if you know you know, you know you know no. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4771.58s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4776.22s)]

*  In conclusion, the llamas and the milk [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4781.02s)]
*  with the green truck body pillows are amazing. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4782.82s)]
*  That's my family. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4785.1s)]
*  Oh, that's your family. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4786.14s)]
*  I can see the similarities. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4787.18s)]
*  Sometimes accountability you gotta take [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4789.58s)]
*  and if you want a good relationship, [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4792.02s)]
*  place it on your head and create a sophisticated goal, [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4794.9400000000005s)]
*  more smarter mind. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4798.78s)]
*  And sometimes in life, [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4800.82s)]
*  when there's lemons, you gotta squeeze them. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4803.26s)]
*  Thank you, Jason. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4804.82s)]
*  Okay, you got a point for that. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4805.9800000000005s)]
*  And somehow you're in the lead. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4807.7s)]
*  What? [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4811.06s)]
*  I don't even know how that happened. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4811.900000000001s)]
*  I have no idea what's going on. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4813.5s)]
*  Okay. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4816.74s)]
*  Now, we move on to the next team. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4819.26s)]
*  Now there were lots of interesting ideas in there. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4824.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4826.58s)]
*  Now it's time for team two to thrive. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4827.46s)]
*  Please walk us through your PowerPoint one slide at a time. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4830.06s)]
*  Each time the slide changes, the next person talks. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4832.58s)]
*  Who would like to start out of both of you guys? [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4836.46s)]
*  I can start, I can start. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4838.74s)]
*  Okay, Nick Pallum, you guys were asked the opposite question. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4841.02s)]
*  How would you spend an unexpected $2 trillion surplus? [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4843.820000000001s)]
*  That means you now have $2 extra trillion to spend and go. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4849.1s)]
*  Okay, this one's actually pretty obvious. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4853.3s)]
*  Okay, the first thing that we're gonna do [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4855.66s)]
*  with the extra money is we're gonna actually [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4856.780000000001s)]
*  give it back to the people. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4859.780000000001s)]
*  Okay, this is America, we should have free healthcare. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4860.740000000001s)]
*  We should, it shouldn't even be a thing. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4863.1s)]
*  College should not cost 10 years or 20 years of salary. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4865.820000000001s)]
*  We're gonna get that back for the people. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4871.14s)]
*  That's exactly what we need here. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4872.9800000000005s)]
*  Two trillion dollars, we can do that. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4874.820000000001s)]
*  Okay, we need to stop, you know, [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4876.18s)]
*  bombing people overseas, we need to keep that money. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4877.860000000001s)]
*  Okay, next slide, Caroline. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4879.62s)]
*  A surplus of ideas, you know, there really is no such thing [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4882.38s)]
*  as a surplus of ideas, so this is ironic. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4886.06s)]
*  Only murders in the building, the DVD box set. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4888.900000000001s)]
*  We're gonna have more murders in the building. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4891.9400000000005s)]
*  More people are gonna be murdered, more! [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4894.820000000001s)]
*  What's happening? [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4898.86s)]
*  Okay, next slide. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4899.86s)]
*  Yep, okay, this is pretty obvious, okay. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4902.219999999999s)]
*  Five P's, okay, first P, okay, polem, that's me, [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4905.179999999999s)]

*  Point! [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4910.94s)]
*  Yes, exactly, number two, also, polemnism, okay. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4911.78s)]
*  That is the way to the future. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4914.98s)]
*  Everyone will have everything they need, [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4916.58s)]
*  everyone will be safe, everyone will be, [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4918.38s)]
*  it's the best thing ever, Hassan actually supports polemnism. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4920.7s)]
*  What's the third P, Nick? [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4922.54s)]
*  Polemnism, so we're gonna keep doing polemnism [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4923.94s)]
*  over and over again until we figure out [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4925.9s)]
*  how to save this country, and the last one is [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4928.14s)]
*  please pick me, and I wanna win, [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4930.9800000000005s)]

*  Next slide. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4935.38s)]
*  How we got here, oh, what a question. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4937.62s)]
*  I'm asking myself that every day. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4940.42s)]
*  Industrial revolution to the gaming skin, [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4942.3s)]
*  industrial complex, I mean, isn't she beautiful? [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4945.18s)]
*  You know what game that's from? [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4952.46s)]
*  What video game is that from? [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4955.5s)]
*  Do you know what game that's from? [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4956.34s)]
*  That's Fortnite. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4957.18s)]
*  Yeah, it is Fortnite. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4958.26s)]
*  Congratulations, points for that, Caroline, good job. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4959.740000000001s)]
*  Next slide. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4962.42s)]
*  Oh, this is great. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4964.22s)]
*  Oh, wait, the benefits, better ingredients, [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4966.1s)]
*  better pizza, shopping malls. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4968.18s)]
*  This is honestly what we need in life. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4970.18s)]
*  We need people to start going outside, [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4971.820000000001s)]
*  doing things together, okay, first thing you can do [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4973.42s)]
*  when you're lonely, let's say you're in a relationship [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4975.42s)]
*  for 10 plus years and suddenly it ends, [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4977.46s)]
*  what you do is you get a dog [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4979.14s)]
*  so you feel better about yourself, okay. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4980.02s)]
*  Step two, you go out with some friends, get some pizza, [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4981.54s)]
*  okay, that's what people need in America [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4985.7s)]
*  and that's what we're gonna do here. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4987.86s)]
*  And then number three, obviously, [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4989.22s)]
*  we need to bring back retail shopping malls, [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4991.26s)]
*  everyone stop ordering online, [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4993.139999999999s)]
*  go outside, see what's going on, [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4994.9s)]
*  okay, meet people, talk to people, [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4997.0199999999995s)]
*  and this is the way we can heal America. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=4998.9s)]
*  Okay, next point. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=5002.0199999999995s)]
*  Now we are taking it to the limit because there, [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=5004.86s)]
*  the limit does not exist. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=5009.34s)]
*  Next slide, back to you, Pallum. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=5016.5s)]
*  Okay, so apparently this is a story [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=5019.139999999999s)]
*  of a real thing that happened to me. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=5020.82s)]
*  Can't wait to see what it was. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=5022.54s)]
*  I was at the grocery store, okay, [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=5023.58s)]
*  the meats and cheese department specifically, [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=5025.9s)]
*  and I wanted to know how much for a pasta salad. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=5028.74s)]
*  In comes Walter, Walter description, okay. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=5031.66s)]
*  What does Walter look like? [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=5035.139999999999s)]
*  He's black. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=5037.54s)]
*  Okay. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=5039.0599999999995s)]
*  And he's bald. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=5039.9s)]
*  The Mario and Luigi type situation, [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=5042.22s)]
*  I don't know what the heck that means [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=5043.9s)]
*  but that's the way it was going down. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=5045.06s)]
*  The pickup line that Walter used [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=5046.780000000001s)]
*  on the deli meats person was, [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=5048.14s)]
*  he was like, yo, I want this sandwich, [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=5050.22s)]
*  I want this pasta, nice shoes, [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=5051.900000000001s)]
*  wanna go out with me? [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=5053.34s)]
*  It did not work. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=5055.14s)]
*  I don't even know what the hell this story was. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=5057.3s)]
*  Moral of the story, do not hit on people [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=5058.34s)]
*  in the deli meats, trust me, it does not work. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=5060.780000000001s)]
*  I feel like you were Walter in this situation. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=5063.02s)]

*  I mean, I got a good answer for that [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6040.98s)]
*  You know, I think that people need something a little bit more strong than Kafa [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6043.98s)]
*  And I would like to actually contact the Central Intelligence Agency and probably get some good Sniffy Angel dust down there [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6050.98s)]
*  Yeah [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6058.98s)]

*  Maybe we can get some fellas incarcerated and increase that crime rate, take it up to 99, maybe 100%, get everybody a secret [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6077.98s)]

*  And yeah, I'm pissed off [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6112.98s)]
*  One thing about me is I love to mine coal [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6115.98s)]
*  I'm basically in there all the time [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6118.98s)]
*  But these lives want me to go green [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6120.98s)]
*  How am I supposed to put 64 chicken, 64 cooked pork, 64 steak, 64 cooked salmon on my plate if I have to use green power? [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6123.98s)]

*  Yeah, but redstone, redstone, when you would connect them [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6151.98s)]
*  Demographically, you're the closest to a Minecraft player [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6157.98s)]
*  Really? What's that supposed to mean? [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6159.98s)]
*  You're 12 [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6162.98s)]
*  You're a baby [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6163.98s)]
*  It's an old game though, it's a very old game [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6164.98s)]
*  But yeah, like I was saying, Minecraft is one of the greatest games of all time [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6168.98s)]
*  I don't even know what a Dreamcast is [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6172.98s)]
*  It's true, he asked earlier what it was [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6176.98s)]
*  Yeah, that pickaxe looked good [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6178.98s)]
*  I forgot what I'm debating about, I'm going to be honest with y'all [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6181.98s)]
*  The question was green energy, how will you stop it in Minecraft? [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6184.98s)]
*  Oh, okay, so first thing I'm going to do, I'm going to get rid of emeralds [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6188.98s)]
*  Because emeralds are green [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6193.98s)]
*  And then I'm going to get diamonds and build probably a pickaxe [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6196.98s)]
*  And then get some obsidian and go to the nether [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6200.98s)]
*  My man [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6205.98s)]
*  I got an idea [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6206.98s)]
*  Alright, let's hear it [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6207.98s)]
*  Okay, so green jobs, Minecraft, what you got to do is get a whole bunch of villagers [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6209.98s)]
*  You got to capture them, you got to make them spawn new villagers [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6214.98s)]
*  And make them do the work for you [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6217.98s)]
*  You way better at being it [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6219.98s)]
*  I like it [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6220.98s)]
*  Nick, you're describing slavery [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6221.98s)]
*  Yes I am [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6223.98s)]
*  Oh wow [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6224.98s)]
*  I don't like it [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6225.98s)]
*  Okay, that's what I would do [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6226.98s)]
*  Anyone else have a rebuttal for Nick's pro-slavery position? [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6230.98s)]
*  Caroline? [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6234.98s)]
*  It's easy points for anyone at this point [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6235.98s)]
*  But if they can't, can I get some points for slavery? [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6237.98s)]
*  Honestly, I agree [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6239.98s)]
*  What? [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6241.98s)]
*  I don't agree on slavery, but I agree with your idea [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6242.98s)]
*  Okay, that's points for me [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6244.98s)]
*  Sure, Nick Pallum, you get a point [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6246.98s)]
*  Yeah! [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6248.98s)]
*  For convincing a young mind that slavery can be advantageous [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6249.98s)]
*  Alright, next question [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6253.98s)]
*  My question is for Caroline [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6262.98s)]
*  Oh [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6264.98s)]
*  I wonder who could... [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6266.98s)]
*  Yeah, so I work for NASA in the space program [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6270.98s)]
*  But like, I'm starting to feel like I can't trust anyone anymore [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6273.98s)]
*  So like, what are you doing to weed out the imposters these days? [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6277.98s)]
*  I'm dead [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6282.98s)]
*  Okay, I just want to start by saying that he had a little bit of a tone [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6283.98s)]
*  Sorry, sorry [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6287.98s)]
*  A little bit of an attitude there [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6288.98s)]
*  I was just doing wires [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6289.98s)]
*  And I found this body [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6290.98s)]
*  Okay [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6292.98s)]
*  Caroline, we really got to figure out who the imposter is here [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6294.98s)]
*  This is getting ridiculous [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6297.98s)]
*  This is crazy, this is wild [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6299.98s)]
*  We can't keep working like this [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6301.98s)]
*  These are insane work conditions, so what are you going to do? [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6303.98s)]
*  What am I going to do? [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6306.98s)]
*  Do you have a girlfriend? [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6308.98s)]
*  You don't see... [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6311.98s)]
*  I don't [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6312.98s)]
*  No, I didn't think so [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6313.98s)]
*  I think that is probably good for both of you to get one [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6314.98s)]
*  If you can [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6320.98s)]
*  You know, I think it'd be good for you [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6322.98s)]
*  One's dead [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6325.98s)]
*  Have you ever talked to a woman? [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6326.98s)]
*  Besides me [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6330.98s)]
*  Yeah, besides me right now [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6331.98s)]
*  Okay, are you taking? [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6333.98s)]
*  I think he's dead [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6336.98s)]
*  No, I don't count [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6338.98s)]
*  I can help this question [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6340.98s)]
*  So that's my advice, talk to a woman [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6341.98s)]
*  Would you like some cocaine? [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6345.98s)]
*  What? [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6347.98s)]
*  I can give you cocaine [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6348.98s)]
*  Okay, I mean, yeah, that might help [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6350.98s)]
*  Alright, just wanted to make sure [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6352.98s)]
*  Any rebuttal on that? [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6354.98s)]
*  I got this one [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6355.98s)]
*  Nick Pallum, go ahead [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6356.98s)]
*  So, you know, not too long ago on Twitch there was this imposter sort of meta going on there [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6357.98s)]
*  What a lot of the big streamers would do in this case is they'd have a second monitor [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6362.98s)]
*  That would have another person's stream open [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6365.98s)]
*  So they always knew who the imposter was when they would adamantly deny it [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6367.98s)]
*  So what we're going to do to eliminate imposter from the space station is install cameras everywhere [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6370.98s)]
*  And we'll be watching you at all times [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6374.98s)]
*  Congratulations, Nick Pallum, points! [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6376.98s)]
*  Okay, I feel like he's the last person who should be in charge of surveillance and having cameras everywhere [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6378.98s)]
*  Carolyn, I got cameras everywhere, right? [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6384.98s)]
*  Yeah [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6386.98s)]
*  Okay [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6387.98s)]
*  Hassan, with all due respect, I feel like you're just throwing points his direction on all of this [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6388.98s)]
*  Because I'm answering the questions, you're not [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6394.98s)]
*  I'm not getting nothing [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6396.98s)]
*  You suggested cocaine [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6397.98s)]
*  I think we need to issue a sort of recount system to sort of reestablish what's going on here [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6399.98s)]
*  Alright, we're moving on to the next question [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6406.98s)]
*  I refuse to entertain this, okay [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6408.98s)]
*  Nick Pallum, I'm a big fan [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6411.98s)]
*  Oh, hey [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6414.98s)]
*  Hi, Nick [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6415.98s)]
*  Hey, how you doing? [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6416.98s)]
*  This question's for you [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6417.98s)]
*  Yep [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6418.98s)]
*  The Blood Elves' alignment with the Horde is one of the Alliance's greatest losses on Azeroth [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6419.98s)]
*  Since the corruption of the Sunwell, what would you do to attract the Dynzeans of Quel'Thalas back into good graces of Stormwind? [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6425.98s)]
*  Thank you [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6433.98s)]
*  Okay, yeah [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6434.98s)]
*  Go ahead [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6435.98s)]
*  This is pretty obvious because what we would do is, you know, we can't rebuild their island, obviously [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6439.98s)]
*  because it's been destroyed [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6445.98s)]
*  The way we're going to bring them back to, you know, to Stormwind is the same [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6446.98s)]
*  what we were going to do earlier with the surplus [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6449.98s)]
*  We're going to give them what they need, we're going to provide for them, and they're going to come back [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6450.98s)]
*  and they're all going to live happily ever after in Stormwind under King Anduin [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6453.98s)]
*  So it's going to be great [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6457.98s)]
*  Okay, Nick Pallum winning the crowd over with that nerdy-ass question, holy [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6459.98s)]
*  Does anyone else have a retort? [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6463.98s)]
*  Yes, sell them cocaine [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6465.98s)]
*  Woo! [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6467.98s)]
*  Okay [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6469.98s)]
*  Points for both Seer and Nick Pallum on that one [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6471.98s)]
*  Alright [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6474.98s)]

*  Don't interrupt his song [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6479.98s)]
*  Let her sing, let her sing, I want to hear her sing [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6481.98s)]
*  Do I get a point? [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6484.98s)]
*  Wait, sing and dance [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6485.98s)]
*  Sing and dance [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6486.98s)]
*  Oh, I mean don't make me sing [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6487.98s)]
*  Don't make me sing [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6490.98s)]
*  Oh god [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6491.98s)]
*  Don't make me sing [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6492.98s)]
*  You can mute it [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6493.98s)]
*  Nobody wants to hear me sing, do they? [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6495.98s)]
*  You make me feel [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6499.98s)]
*  You make me feel [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6502.98s)]
*  You make me feel [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6505.98s)]
*  Like a natural woman [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6508.98s)]
*  Caroline, I will give you points if you stop [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6514.98s)]
*  Listen, she can have my points, dog [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6517.98s)]
*  Oh, okay, how many? Two? [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6519.98s)]
*  Point, you stop [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6520.98s)]
*  No, just one [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6521.98s)]
*  Okay, that was incredible [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6522.98s)]
*  That was incredible [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6524.98s)]
*  I want to thank our guests for being here [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6525.98s)]
*  and speaking so frankly about their struggles [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6527.98s)]
*  Let's review the points total with only one more round to go [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6530.98s)]
*  Alright, let's take a look [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6535.98s)]
*  At the tippy top we have Nick Pallum with 13 points [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6538.98s)]
*  Thank you, I'm for the people [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6543.98s)]
*  Jason The Ween in second place tied alongside Caroline Kwan [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6545.98s)]
*  and Kyre at 11 points [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6548.98s)]
*  They sell money at nine points [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6551.98s)]
*  despite a relative strong middle game right there [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6554.98s)]
*  Hey [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6559.98s)]
*  Okay, how are we feeling? [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6560.98s)]

*  Hassan? [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6564.98s)]
*  Yes [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6565.98s)]
*  You [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6566.98s)]
*  He's on cocaine [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6567.98s)]
*  Alright, I want to give a quick shout out to Tiltify and the link [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6570.98s)]
*  I hope you guys are still donating, hopefully if you want me to tattoo [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6576.98s)]
*  That's what the producers are telling me in my ear [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6579.98s)]
*  because apparently you guys are not donating enough [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6581.98s)]
*  I don't know what the next milestone is [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6583.98s)]
*  Oh my God, we are about to reach the [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6585.98s)]

*  $50 away [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6589.98s)]
*  Hassan, you know what would help us reach that milestone? [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6591.98s)]
*  Why did you put your goddamn jacket on? [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6594.98s)]
*  Look at us [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6597.98s)]
*  I messed up, I didn't realize [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6598.98s)]
*  Look at us, look at the way we're dressed [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6601.98s)]
*  What are you guys wheeling over there? [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6603.98s)]
*  Don't wheel that [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6604.98s)]
*  No, it's fine, it's all good [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6605.98s)]
*  We're just not [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6606.98s)]
*  We're not going to reach the milestone [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6607.98s)]
*  We're about to hit my favorite milestone [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6608.98s)]
*  We're not [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6610.98s)]

*  You think they'd play it again? [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6691.98s)]
*  That's a good one [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6694.98s)]
*  It's no eagle scream, but it's pretty good [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6695.98s)]
*  I wonder if they have that one [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6698.98s)]
*  Eagle [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6699.98s)]
*  No shot [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6700.98s)]
*  No shot [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6701.98s)]
*  That's only on name your price [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6702.98s)]
*  You have the scary board [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=6704.98s)]

*  No, but he's doing God's work ladies and gentlemen [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7354.98s)]
*  So what does he do when he cannot stream? [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7358.98s)]
*  Practice mindfulness [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7361.98s)]

*  He can use it [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7388.98s)]
*  What do you think about, how does that make you feel? [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7390.98s)]
*  I'm the one asking the questions here, okay? [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7393.98s)]
*  Elaborate on why porn, quick [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7395.98s)]
*  Ten more seconds [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7397.98s)]
*  Ten more seconds? [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7398.98s)]
*  Yes [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7399.98s)]
*  Okay [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7400.98s)]
*  No, I got something crazy for you there [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7401.98s)]
*  We got ten seconds and I know typically that's how fast you get it done [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7403.98s)]
*  So a lot of the time it's like, it is what it is [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7406.98s)]
*  And I know sometimes boys skip to the end of the video and that's all the time you got left, right? [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7409.98s)]
*  So ladies and gentlemen [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7414.98s)]
*  Okay, it's time for you guys [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7415.98s)]
*  Thank you [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7419.98s)]
*  Nick Pallow [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7422.98s)]
*  Yes sir [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7423.98s)]
*  You are currently leading by a lot of points [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7424.98s)]
*  Good, I should be [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7428.98s)]
*  This might solidify your victory [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7430.98s)]
*  What do I do in my next chapter? [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7432.98s)]
*  You have sixty seconds on the clock [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7434.98s)]
*  Go [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7436.98s)]
*  Okay, thank you Hassan [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7437.98s)]
*  So the question is what would Hassan do if he was, if Twitch banned politics? [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7439.98s)]
*  Well it's obvious [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7443.98s)]
*  You just go to YouTube and you continue doing politics because that's all you do, is politics [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7444.98s)]
*  So you'd never stop doing politics [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7449.98s)]
*  Hell, you might even start running for office somewhere if they let you, to be honest [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7451.98s)]
*  So you just keep going with what you're doing because it works for you [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7455.98s)]
*  I see you gameplay streams [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7457.98s)]
*  YouTube live streaming sucks [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7458.98s)]
*  Do not put Hassan in the office [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7461.98s)]
*  Okay, alright, moving on Jason, no points for you Nick [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7463.98s)]
*  What would I do in my second chapter, in my final chapter in life? [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7467.98s)]
*  I mean, like Ludwig said over there, muscular, handsome, nice beard, alright, you know, please take your tank top off [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7471.98s)]
*  I'd probably go with, yeah, come on, come on [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7480.98s)]
*  Come on, yeah [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7483.98s)]
*  This is a serious debate show [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7484.98s)]
*  Probably go with OnlyFans, yeah [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7486.98s)]
*  Hey, if you want to buy Hassan's OnlyFans, let me get an old rock [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7491.98s)]
*  But yeah, OnlyFans [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7498.98s)]
*  Okay, that's the same answer, give me a different answer [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7500.98s)]
*  You have 30 more seconds [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7502.98s)]
*  See that's what I was going to say but they took it [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7503.98s)]
*  Probably flipping burgers [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7506.98s)]
*  Elaborate [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7510.98s)]
*  I mean, besides politics, besides your looks, you got nothing else [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7512.98s)]
*  So, flipping burgers [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7518.98s)]
*  Okay, points for Jason [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7520.98s)]
*  Caroline Kwan, if you deliver here, you're at 11 points alongside Seer [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7522.98s)]
*  Besides BBNO Games, you guys have an opportunity [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7529.98s)]
*  Okay, if you deliver here very well, you could potentially pick up [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7532.98s)]
*  But I need you to lock the end, you have a minute [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7536.98s)]
*  What is my next chapter? Go [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7539.98s)]
*  Your next chapter, well, I think maybe you'd finally participate in pop culture [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7542.98s)]
*  For the first time in your life, you'd listen to music, you'd watch movies [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7548.98s)]
*  You would become the biggest male movie film guy on Twitch [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7553.98s)]
*  Because there's a lot of space, there's really, you know, space to fill in that area [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7560.98s)]
*  And obviously you would pick films by strong women [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7568.98s)]
*  You're just describing your boyfriend [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7573.98s)]
*  Yeah, that would be the next chapter, wouldn't it? [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7577.98s)]
*  Yeah, I'd finally get you broken down without politics, you'd come crying to daddy [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7580.98s)]
*  Okay, no points for you, Caroline, Seer, up next [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7586.98s)]
*  Oh, I know exactly what would happen [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7592.98s)]
*  One minute on the clock, go [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7594.98s)]
*  Yeah, politics gets banned from Twitch [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7595.98s)]
*  You try and become an actor, but you fail [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7598.98s)]
*  You run out of money, eventually in one day you get into a car accident dance [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7601.98s)]
*  You end up in a vegetative state, life support [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7606.98s)]
*  Eventually you watched all your loved ones give up on you [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7610.98s)]
*  You eventually come out of it, resent society, resent yourself, resent the healthcare system [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7614.98s)]
*  And you overdose on ketamine [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7620.98s)]
*  And guess what? I'll be at your funeral drinking a martini [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7622.98s)]
*  Yeah! [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7628.98s)]
*  You don't have points, Seer, good job [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7629.98s)]
*  That's what happens with you with my points, Hassan! [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7631.98s)]
*  Give me my points! [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7634.98s)]
*  Okay, there's no tiebreaker [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7637.98s)]
*  Tom, producer Tom is yelling at me in my ear [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7640.98s)]
*  Saying there's a tiebreaker rebuttal, but currently Seer is sitting at 12 points [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7643.98s)]
*  Caroline Kwan at 11, Jason The Wean at 13, NMP at 14 [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7646.98s)]
*  And Baby No Money at 10 [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7650.98s)]
*  Yeah! [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7653.98s)]
*  That's the word [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7655.98s)]
*  Okay [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7659.98s)]
*  What? [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7663.98s)]
*  You are like four hours late, dog, what do you mean what? [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7664.98s)]
*  It is tough for a YouTube streamer to get through security [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7669.98s)]
*  There's a lot of manhandling going on, you know [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7672.98s)]
*  Uh huh [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7674.98s)]
*  There's a few layers [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7675.98s)]
*  Alright, well [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7676.98s)]
*  His moped broke down [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7677.98s)]
*  That's about time, ladies and gentlemen [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7679.98s)]
*  I've got a lot to think about, crowd and chat [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7681.98s)]

*  If Hassan could no longer do politics [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7730.98s)]
*  He would just do train stuff [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oYTtwOBel0&t=7732.98s)]
