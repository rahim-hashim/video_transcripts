*  Mexico composed of thousands of people. It seems to be unstoppable in its quest to come [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=50.04s)]
*  through our currently open border on January 20th as one of many, my many first executive orders, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% tariff on all products [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=60.76s)]
*  coming into the United States and its ridiculous open borders. This tariff will remain in effect [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=68.52s)]

*  our country. Both Mexico and Canada have the absolute right in power. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=80.28s)]

*  unstoppable in its quest to come through our currently open border. He just invented a caravan [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=123.8s)]
*  too. As one of them, uh, of one of my many first executive orders, I will sign all necessary [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=127.64s)]
*  documents to charge Mexico and Canada 25% tariff on all products coming into the United States [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=132.12s)]

*  particular fentanyl and all illegal alien stop this invasion of our country. Both Mexico and [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=141.95999999999998s)]
*  Canada have the absolute right in power to easily solve this long simmering problem. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=146.44s)]
*  We're here by demand that they use this power and until such time that they do is time for them to [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  pay a very big price. I've had many talks with China about the massive amounts of drugs in [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=154.28s)]
*  particular fentanyl being sent to the United States, but to no avail. Representatives of China [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=158.83999999999997s)]
*  told me that they would institute their maximum penalty that of death for any drug dealers caught [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=163.56s)]
*  doing this, but unfortunately they never followed through and drugs are pouring into our country, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=167.48s)]
*  mostly through Mexico had levels never seen before until such time as they stop. We will be [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=173.56s)]
*  charging China an additional 10% tariff above any additional tariffs on all of their many products [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=179.08s)]
*  coming into the United States of America. Thank you for your attention to this matter. Boys just [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=184.68s)]
*  want to say good luck to the future of this country. I feel like I feel like if implemented [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=190.12s)]
*  these tariffs are going to laser prices in the opposite direction. Like I just I can't understand [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=197.16s)]
*  it. It feels like he's just purposely trying to destroy the economy. I'm telling you now the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=206.20000000000002s)]
*  fucking walls are not to keep Mexicans out is to keep your ass in. Okay. You will find that it turns [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=211.48s)]
*  out the walls were not there to keep the Guatemalans out. Oh no, they were to keep you in here. Okay. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=221.79999999999998s)]
*  Holy shit. What a spectacular, what a spectacular future. Oh my God. Incredible to easily solve [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=230.04s)]
*  this long simmering problem. We hear by demand that they use this power until such time they do. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=240.52s)]
*  It is time for them to pay a very big price. He went on to add that he is also adding 10% [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=246.28s)]
*  to all products from China. If they don't stop also weak sauce that he only is given 10% to China, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=252.52s)]
*  but 25% to Canada and Mexico, two of America's most valuable trade partners. Oh my God. I think [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=259.0s)]
*  it's supposed to be 25 plus 10. Oh, oh, he's adding. Oh, he's doing. Oh my God. Wait. So [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=268.2s)]
*  China gets 35%. How much of that is trade for America? It's got to be near 50%. But if you [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=275.4s)]
*  compile Canada, Mexico and China, like it's, it's probably almost half of all American trade at that [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=283.48s)]
*  point list of, list of largest trading partners in the United States. Oh, they said they were [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=291.0s)]
*  going to do that to the European union too. Donald Trump is a JD pond style permanent first [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=300.68s)]
*  world genocidist. It seems he said no more treats, no more treats for you fatty. It's almost half. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=306.28s)]
*  Oh my God. Oh no. Oh my God. Oh no. It's a 45%. I was right. Oh, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=314.2s)]
*  oh, this is so stupid. Like this is people will say, Hassan, how are you like laughing about this? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=328.2s)]
*  But it's like, it's so completely out of my hands. Will that also apply to the electric power that [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=334.04s)]
*  the USA gets from Canada? I don't know. 45% is not 50%. I said almost 50%. Okay. Calm down. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=339.16s)]
*  In 2021, the US increased imports of oils, minerals, lime and cement from Canada from 60.3 [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=349.24s)]
*  billion in 2020 to 105.3 billion, an increase of 74%. In 2021, the imports of oils, minerals, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=353.96000000000004s)]
*  lime and cement from Canada constituted almost half of the total US imports of these commodities. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=361.56s)]
*  We've already described how tariffs work, right? Like I think everybody here, at least [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=366.68s)]
*  now at this point understands how it works. Like it's a, it's a fee that companies that are [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=370.84000000000003s)]
*  importing stuff are going to have to pay to the government. And therefore it's therefore they're [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=377.16s)]
*  going to make the cost of goods that much higher for the average American. They're going to carry [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=383.48s)]
*  over the cost. They're not going to like eat away at their profits, eat away at their profit margins. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=388.6s)]
*  It's going to make every single thing more expensive. So it's basically a sales tax. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=393.64s)]
*  No dude, China doesn't pay the tariffs. What are you talking about? Shut up. What? That's not real. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=398.44s)]
*  No, why would they pay for the tariffs? You want to allow them to come through Canada? We're going [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=404.2s)]
*  to tariff you. You want to allow drugs to come through our southern border? We're going to [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=408.52s)]
*  tariff you. You want to allow them to come through Canada? We're going to tariff you. China, if you're [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=413.08s)]
*  going to allow this stuff to get sold in our country, largely produced in China, we're going [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=417.0s)]
*  to add another 10% to your chair. We are going to cost your countries, your economies. We're going [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=422.28s)]
*  to cost your businesses billions, hundreds of billions of dollars. If you think you're going to [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=426.84s)]
*  poison Americans, it's not going to happen. You're not going to destroy our youth. You're [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=433.32s)]
*  not going to destroy our society. You're not going to destroy our families. You're not going to do [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=437.15999999999997s)]
*  it. It's going to cost you. I'm going to put an end to it. Laura, when my father sent that 20 minutes [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=441.96s)]
*  ago, I literally cheered out loud. I run a manufacturing shop in New Jersey. We built [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=446.59999999999997s)]
*  circuit breakers, switch gear for generators. The breakers we buy are built in Mexico, are [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=452.12s)]
*  made in closure manufacturers in Canada, and China is the third largest copper producer in the world. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=456.04s)]
*  I'm Brian Killme. I don't understand. Do they legitimately think that China is going to pay [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=460.2s)]
*  for it or something? How would China have the capacity to pay for it? Do you think that they're [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=465.08s)]
*  just going to fucking give money to the people that are importing it, or do you think they're [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=469.96s)]
*  going to cut costs to make up for the tariffs? Is that what it is? Even though they haven't done [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=474.68s)]
*  that. Like what are they, how are they thinking that this process works? Asan, don't you remember [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=481.08s)]
*  the hater video we watched? Most people don't think at all. It's true, but it's so funny being [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=485.8s)]
*  Canadian right now, being in the Canadian government, being like, what drugs are coming [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=490.84s)]
*  over our border? What are you saying? Like what? There's a, there's a mass influx of migrants [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=494.84s)]
*  fleeing Canada into America. What? Like why do tariffs raise prices, but corporate taxes don't? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=500.03999999999996s)]
*  First of all, when have we increased the corporate tax rate? You mean to say, why don't prices [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=506.84000000000003s)]
*  decrease when corporate tax rates decrease? If that's your question, then yes, that would be a [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=513.24s)]
*  good question to ask economists. It seemingly never goes in that direction, but as far as like a [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=520.12s)]
*  corporate tax versus tariffs, it makes sense. You can move certain things around, but a complete [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=526.76s)]
*  tariff on all of the raw materials necessary will of course increase the, the cost like taxes on the [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=533.24s)]
*  corporate side are coming in after the fact. It's coming off of your profits. It's coming off of your, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=540.44s)]
*  the revenue generated tariffs are not tariffs are just raw goods materials necessary for production. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=547.64s)]
*  It's just making the production more costly. It's that simple. What the fuck? Also, holy fuck, dude. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=554.44s)]
*  Look at this 73% overall cable news audiences. Prime time is watching Fox news. MSNBC is getting [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=560.52s)]
*  16% CNN is getting 11%. Holy shit. Yeah. I've said this before as well. I think they want to [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=566.04s)]
*  cut income taxes as a substitute. I liked that the dumb asses over at Fox news basically kept crying [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=573.4s)]
*  about, basically kept crying about mainstream media, mainstream media. And then they cried [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=579.24s)]
*  themselves into being the only major media outlet. And it's still funny because like right-wingers [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=585.24s)]
*  still complain. They still talk about the over-representation of libtards in mainstream news [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=590.36s)]
*  and shit about 25% of lumber used in the U S is Canadian. It'll kill home builders. If 45% of U S [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=596.2s)]
*  imports were increased by 35%, it would rate 1.34 billion. That's 71.34 billion that the rich don't [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=602.76s)]
*  need to be taxed. Single warfare against more than half the world usually turns out fine. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=608.6s)]
*  Well, at a certain point, the quantitative shift in genders, in genders, a qualitative shift. And [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=614.36s)]
*  if you're imposing the siege on yourself, but the extraordinary nature of U S hegemony means we are [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=620.04s)]
*  not quite there. I don't imagine that people with any idea about how any of this will actually let [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=624.4399999999999s)]
*  Trump impose the moron China tariffs. He loves to talk about, but if per chance he somehow gets that [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=628.52s)]
*  done, we might find out about all this sooner. What is this alarm about sanctions is rises reached [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=633.0s)]
*  the highest levels of the U S government. Some senior administration officials have told president [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=638.04s)]
*  Biden directly that the overuse of sanctions risk making the tool less valuable. If you remember, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=641.48s)]
*  we were ringing the alarm bells about the sanctions already early on, but of course, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=646.52s)]
*  Jeff over at WAPO did a fantastic piece on America's sanctions regimes, skyrocketing, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=652.5999999999999s)]
*  and basically creating an entire creating an entire universe of countries that are completely [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=661.88s)]
*  outside of the sphere of influence of America because they had the, because they had to basically [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=671.48s)]
*  create a secondary market for themselves. Turns out if you fucking sanction half the planet, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=677.24s)]
*  then you basically have created half of the fucking planet's new market. You force them into a [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=685.16s)]
*  secondary market. Holy shit. Yeah. Here is, here is a, this is democracy. I mean, we've, we've covered [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=691.48s)]
*  this before. The, the Washington post investigation was called money war. And Jeff Stein is the, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=696.92s)]
*  is the person who conducted this investigation. It seems like this is financial times though. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=705.0799999999999s)]
*  Anyway, and yet despite recognition of the volume of sanctions, maybe excessive U S officials tend [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=710.68s)]
*  to see each individual action is justified, making it hard to stop the trend. The United States [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=714.92s)]

*  countries now under some form of financial penalty, according to a Washington post analysis, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=724.2s)]
*  Senator Marco Rubio, China, Russia, and Iran are reading us sanctions by using alternative financial [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=730.2s)]
*  systems introduced the bill, which would ensure these regimes are held accountable as they attempt [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=734.5200000000001s)]

*  Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me, sir. I don't think you understand what you're doing. What you're [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=744.5200000000001s)]

*  superpower status in the world, by the way. But yeah, when you sanction the world, when you [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=776.28s)]
*  sanction the entire world at the end of the day, you know, that means you are left alone. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=781.48s)]
*  And the reality of the matter is while the United States of America is the largest consumption engine [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=786.84s)]
*  on the planet and still plays a pretty big role in the global marketplace, still plays a ginormous [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=791.8000000000001s)]
*  role in the global marketplace. I think this kind of sanctions regime coming, not even sanctions, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=797.8000000000001s)]
*  but this kind of tariffs regime coming from the United States of America is also literally [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=804.52s)]
*  it's JD pawn shit, dude. I'm telling you, Donald Trump is doing permanent first world genocide. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=811.64s)]

*  fuck it. Yolo. It's it's time. It's time for a new empire to, to, to come in and fix the situation. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=824.6s)]
*  Yeah. The mega communists were right. Okay. The mega communists were secretly in Trump's ear. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=832.28s)]
*  He is JD pond. Trump is saying America KKK must suffer. America KKK must suffer for the endless [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=837.88s)]
*  bloodshed that it has caused in the third world. Okay. The revolutionary of the third world must be [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=846.84s)]

*  Mexico. That is in addition to the tariffs already. Tariffs are not supposed to be used as a [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=871.24s)]
*  punitive measure. Right? The ideal situation is to use them while also beefing up manufacturing. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=877.88s)]
*  They encourage a return to American products where we're not getting that part. Are we? Yes. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=881.16s)]
*  And you can also do that for like raw materials. Like there's just shit that's not here. You know [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=884.68s)]
*  what I mean? Like, what are you supposed to do? Not only do we not have manufacturing, but like [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=889.16s)]
*  it also doesn't make sense if you just don't have certain raw materials and you're just slapping a [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=893.88s)]
*  tariff onto it because you're mad. Like, what are you, what are you supposed to do? What, what, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=899.3199999999999s)]

*  I guess lithium, they there's, there's places it's just going to be devastating for the American [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=909.0s)]
*  environment too. That's the other aspect of this. Like we have trees. It's not like we're not fucking [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=913.96s)]
*  trees. Let's say we beef up the lumber industry to make up for the additional demand that we're [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=918.92s)]
*  not getting, or to make up for the additional supply that we're not getting from Canada. Okay. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=925.24s)]
*  Now you're just like wiping out entire fucking forests in America. You know what I mean? Like, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=929.4799999999999s)]
*  everything is bad. I don't know how else to describe it. I do not see a good way out of this [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=933.64s)]
*  is what I mean. Okay. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj_8PuAMvEk&t=938.68s)]
