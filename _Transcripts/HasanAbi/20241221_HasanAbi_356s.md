# The Truth Behind Wealth And Capitalism | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [December 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM)
*  the more they they think like, oh, wealthy people are powerful for a reason. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=0.0s)]
*  They are the ordained, you know? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=5.12s)]
*  Anyway, it is peasant brain for sure. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=8.08s)]
*  And I f**k that. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=10.56s)]
*  I hate that like people glaze Elon and do this sort of stuff. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=11.6s)]
*  I just, I don't know. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=15.76s)]
*  Poor people don't want the rich to pay more, distribute more because they [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=17.28s)]
*  towards capitalism and the meritocracy of it all, the lie that is like, if you're wealthy, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=20.08s)]
*  you're good. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=32.879999999999995s)]
*  If you put the prosperity gospels declares that if you're wealthy, you're good. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  You're morally virtuous. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=36.72s)]
*  If you're poor, you're evil and you deserve your poor financial circumstances. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=38.64s)]
*  You did something wrong. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=43.599999999999994s)]
*  So that that's the reason why you're there and that meritocracy is real. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=46.16s)]
*  So if you're wealthy, you earned it across the board. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=49.76s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=52.32s)]
*  And the inverse of that is that if you're poor, you just didn't try hard enough. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=53.839999999999996s)]
*  And that's not the case when that's not the reality. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  And that's certainly not the case. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=60.08s)]
*  And, and I think it's, it just, I don't know, it just, it just makes people focus on the wrong. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=62.48s)]
*  It be a good person. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=69.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=71.6s)]
*  I think that's significantly more important than how wealthy you are. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=72.64s)]
*  Try to do right by others. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=76.72s)]
*  You know, help people. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=78.96s)]
*  The rich, the poor, but the poor love the rich for some reason in America. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=80.56s)]
*  Yeah, that is true as well. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=83.68s)]
*  By the way, your new favorite, Alutla wants to slap to Twitch for your reaction. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=85.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=89.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=89.52s)]
*  Whatever, dude. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=89.76s)]
*  Why people don't just expand their knowledge when they have more wealth slash time to do. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=90.72s)]
*  So does not really make sense to me if they did. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=94.32s)]
*  They'd likely do more to make the world a better place. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=97.12s)]
*  Hustle culture is so many people's brains. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=99.6s)]
*  If you're wealthy and you want a better distribution of wealth, you will get more [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=101.28s)]
*  some rich prick just flexing on them. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=103.84s)]
*  It's an attack on a lot of people's beliefs that they can't make. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=105.76s)]
*  They can make it too, instead of pussy redistribution of wealth. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  I know, I know it breaks my brain. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=110.64s)]
*  It breaks my brain when I've when I sit here and I'm, and I'm talking about like, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=113.04s)]
*  you know, people trying to uplift themselves and, and in their immediate [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  surroundings in their workplace by unionizing or any number of different things, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=123.04s)]
*  which is not even about like stealing from the rich or anything. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=126.80000000000001s)]
*  It's literally you clawing back the value that you're generating with your work [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=129.76000000000002s)]
*  that you are basically lining the pockets of wealthy people on. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=135.04s)]
*  And people will get more mad at me for saying that as a rich guy, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=138.95999999999998s)]
*  even though I was saying it when I was a poor guy too, then a rich guy that just goes, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=142.32s)]
*  you're broke and you can get out of it. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  You're broken. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  You can get out of it by doing the same things that I did here by my course for $75 a month. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  Get in my discord and I will teach you the ways of doing rug pulls. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=156.23999999999998s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  It's so dumb. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=161.76s)]
*  People are just unfortunately very d***ed, I think. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=163.11999999999998s)]
*  Well, they have a few things I've found in general. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=167.67999999999998s)]
*  They don't like exposing the wealth of people who don't have wealth as a security thing. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  Don't like directly helping people also not to have that be a part of the relationship. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=172.07999999999998s)]
*  Being overwhelmed by raw money amounts is a trauma response to the vast scarcity [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=177.44s)]
*  president society that deeply hurt people. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=181.44s)]
*  I think so. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=184.23999999999998s)]
*  I mean, I think that plays a role in it as well. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=185.04s)]
*  I think the more desperate people get, the worse this happens as well. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=187.2s)]
*  The more desperate people get, the worse wealth disparity gets, the more they [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=191.6s)]
*  valorize the wealthy, the more they think, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=198.8s)]
*  oh, wealthy people are powerful for a reason. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=202.32s)]
*  They are the ordained. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=205.76s)]
*  Anyway, it is peasant brain for sure. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  And I f*** that. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=211.12s)]
*  People glaze Elon and do this sort of stuff. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=213.04000000000002s)]
*  I just, I don't know. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=216.4s)]
*  Poor people don't want the rich to pay more, distribute more, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=217.92000000000002s)]
*  because they have a fantasy of when they finally become rich, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=220.32s)]
*  they want to keep as much as they can. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=222.4s)]
*  I know. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=223.6s)]
*  And we become more cynical as well. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=224.32s)]
*  I think that's part of the reason why people interpret what I'm saying. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=225.92s)]
*  As like, people interpret what I'm saying is like insincere. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=229.44s)]
*  Oh, he must be not recognizing that the guy who's telling, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=233.92s)]
*  the guy who's telling you, you are going to make it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=238.24s)]
*  All you need to do is give me $75 on my discord and you're going to make it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=241.84s)]
*  You're going to be rich just like me. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=247.68s)]
*  Look at all the f***ing, look at all the nice things I own. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=249.12s)]
*  And half of that s*** is also rented, rented cars, Airbnb's. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=251.44s)]
*  They're just faking it. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=255.36s)]
*  There's like a, there's like a method to it as well. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=256.56s)]
*  You just go and spend a little bit of upfront capital [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=259.76s)]
*  to just make it seem like you are incredibly f***ing rich and incredibly successful. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=263.52s)]
*  And then you tell everybody how incredibly rich and incredibly successful you are. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=268.96s)]
*  And then you sell your course on how you got there. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=273.36s)]
*  The course is f***ing fake, nonsensical b******t too. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=276.48s)]
*  And then people just like buy the course. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=279.52s)]
*  And then you actually do start generating more income. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=281.6s)]
*  And then you can dump that, dump some of that back into [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=284.56s)]
*  making it seem like you have a lot of wealth and rinse and repeat. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=288.32s)]
*  It's just, I feel like we were more, I feel like we used to be more [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=292.08s)]
*  cynical about gurus like this. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=297.84000000000003s)]
*  But now we just don't have that cynicism at all. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=302.24s)]
*  We just like lap it up. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=305.04s)]
*  We eat the s*** up. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=306.4s)]
*  The worst part of wealth is how you disconnect from everything that lets you be rich in society. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=307.6s)]
*  I've noticed is my salary has literally got closer to not having constant financial stress. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=310.96000000000004s)]
*  And then my coworkers were already there. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=314.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. No, for sure. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=316.48s)]
*  Money does have a tendency to f***ing isolate you because, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=318.72s)]
*  I mean, I've talked about this quite a bit. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=322.56s)]
*  Like one of the examples I've always used is being able to fly business class. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=324.08000000000004s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=329.84000000000003s)]
*  All of a sudden you're treated like a human being when you're flying. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=330.96000000000004s)]
*  Like that's it. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=333.68s)]
*  And then if that's your norm now, that's one major aspect of commercial air travel [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=335.28s)]
*  that you are never going to experience for the rest of your life. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=341.12s)]
*  Anyway, let's talk about Shamique more as well. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=345.03999999999996s)]
*  This is a kind of a funny story. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=347.2s)]
*  This dude is [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcql8m-ezhM&t=350.56s)]
