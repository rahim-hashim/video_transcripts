# Israel Turned Eid In Gaza Into A Day Of Mourning | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [March 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk)
*  I believe unconditionally that the Palestinian population has a right to autonomy, a right to sovereignty, a right to live free of the Israeli occupation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=0.0s)]
*  Okay? I don't care what the people call themselves in the process of that. I don't care what kind of political formations occur in that process. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=10.16s)]
*  I believe that Palestinians have a right to emancipation. I want Palestinians to be able to have a free election. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=18.28s)]
*  In Gaza today marked the start of Eid, another day of Israeli strikes, the latest on a tented encampment in Khan Yunis. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=30.56s)]
*  The injured brought to Al Nasser Hospital, where staff said 16 were killed, among them nine children and three women. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=38.24s)]
*  In the morgue, two sisters dressed for the festival lay next to each other, joined by their younger brother and then their mother. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=46.08s)]
*  We were waiting for them to come visit this Eid, but they died in their Eid clothes. Why did they do this to us? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=55.92s)]
*  As the dead were buried, across the city Eid prayers, a day typically marked with vibrant colour and children's gifts, suffused instead with grief and fear. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=65.92s)]
*  Animals, dude. Animals. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=80.92s)]
*  My grand son is a martyr. There is no joy and there is no taste to anything. As you can see, even when we pray, we feel afraid and there are aircraft overhead. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=83.88s)]
*  The Israeli military released images of what it said were strikes on terrorist infrastructure as it announced an expanded ground operation in the far south. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=95.88s)]
*  The Prime Minister vowing to crush Hamas further in order to free Israeli hostages. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=103.88s)]
*  It's interesting that we just watched three hours of n***y documentaries and then we go back to the living, breathing, current, modern example of the activity. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=108.83999999999999s)]
*  This is it. It doesn't have to be the exact same. It doesn't have to be Auschwitz-style concentration camps where they've mechanized death. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=118.84s)]
*  In real time in broad daylight, live streaming the h***. It's crazy. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=132.8s)]
*  So if you wonder, you know, how could regular Germans turn a blind eye to all of these atrocities look no further than this? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=137.8s)]
*  I guess ironically regular Germans turn a blind eye to these atrocities as well right now, but that's a different point, I guess. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=147.8s)]
*  Hostages, 24 of whom are believed still to be alive. He says Israel is engaging in ceasefire talks, but the final destination is non-negotiable. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=155.76000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, Benjamin Netanyahu's recent points on the matter is basically, no, we're going to keep pummeling. We're going to keep doing everything we possibly can. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=165.76000000000002s)]
*  And the reason why we're doing that is because Trump gave us the go-ahead. We're going to make it unlivable to be in Gaza. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=175.72s)]
*  So those who do remain, those who do survive, will be forced out of Gaza by force. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=182.72s)]
*  Hamas will disarm. Its leaders will be allowed to leave. We will ensure general security in the Gaza Strip and allow the implementation of the Trump plan, the voluntary immigration plan. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=190.72s)]
*  In Tel Aviv last night, protesters instead demanding a deal that ends the war and brings the hostages home. A poll on Friday suggested 69% of Israelis agree. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=205.72s)]
*  Hamas says it's accepted a new Egyptian Qatari proposal for a ceasefire that would see five Israeli hostages released per week, but it rejects Israel's longer-term demands. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=217.72s)]
*  There will be no displacement or deportation. As for the weapons of the resistance, they are a red line and are linked to the existence of the occupation and the establishment of the independent Palestinian state. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=228.68s)]
*  But Hamas has been facing protests of its own. On three consecutive days last week, hundreds chanted Hamas out, calling for an end to the war. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=243.68s)]
*  For now, those protests have receded amid reports of violence and intimidation. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=252.68s)]
*  One of those who took part, Uday al-Rabai. On Saturday, his body was dragged to his parents' door. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=258.68s)]
*  They tortured him to death with all kinds of hard tools, says this man. An iron fist must be brought down upon these criminal oppressors. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=265.68s)]
*  That in itself, another rare challenge to Hamas's authority. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=276.68s)]
*  It's not Hasbara, dude. It's not. I mean, this is definitely like this is definitely physical political repression for people who are for people who are protesting against Hamas and protesting against Hamas in a way where they feel like is in collaboration with the Israeli state. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=281.64s)]
*  This is ironically what Mohammed was fearful of. Mohammed Shahada's analysis on the matter. He's Palestinian. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=303.59999999999997s)]
*  Was that eventually, because Israel is also goading and saying like you have to do these if you want to survive, that it automatically changes the dynamic away from real popular mobilization. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=310.59999999999997s)]
*  The political development of Hamas into or desperate acts where people were people because of their political disagreements or because they truly believe that like Hamas is responsible for the death and destruction, even though it's not as Israel. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=326.56s)]
*  Let's be real. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=341.56s)]
*  Will turn into will be branded as like pro Israeli activity internally inside of Gaza. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=343.52s)]
*  It does not shock me even a little bit that a lot of the mainstream outlets that refuse to talk about the pro riots inside of Israel that didn't talk about the 49 pages of hardline evidence of Israel using as a weapon of war during its in Gaza. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=351.52s)]
*  I've been laser focused on these on these protests, even though the protests overall were the protests that have taken place so far have broadly been about have broadly been about. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=370.47999999999996s)]
*  Not Hamas, but instead Israel doing untold amounts of violence to the Palestinian population. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=385.47999999999996s)]
*  Ultimately, it does not matter what the Palestinian population says, because even if they were to change leadership, which, by the way, Hamas is not against even if they were to change leadership, it's not like Israel stopping his nation as policies. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=394.44s)]
*  The notion that this is actually. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=412.44s)]
*  The notion that Israel's bombing Gaza because of Hamas is stupid. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=415.44s)]
*  That's not the case. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=420.44s)]
*  Israel simply wants to occupy these territories. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=422.4s)]
*  Israel will not stop. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=426.4s)]
*  Occupying these territories. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=429.4s)]
*  That's it. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=431.4s)]
*  It's that simple. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=432.4s)]
*  This is not a simple political disagreement. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=433.4s)]
*  After all, look no further than what has taken place in the West Bank. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=436.4s)]
*  If you want to understand what happens when there is no Hamas. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=439.4s)]
*  Ironically enough, when you look at the West Bank and the popularity of the Palestinian Authority, Hamas as a direct contrast is one significantly more popular than the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=443.35999999999996s)]
*  But then again, Hamas is less popular in Gaza than it is in the West Bank. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=456.35999999999996s)]
*  Something that I've mentioned time and time again. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=460.35999999999996s)]
*  However, Hamas inside of Gaza is still infinitely more popular than the Palestinian Authority is inside of the West Bank. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=462.35999999999996s)]
*  And there's a reason for that. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=472.32s)]
*  These people that are protesting against Hamas are not protesting against the resistance. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=474.32s)]
*  They're not protesting against people resisting. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=478.32s)]
*  They're protesting against Hamas directly. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=480.32s)]
*  The ones that do. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=482.32s)]
*  But ultimately all Palestinians are united under the same banner. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=484.32s)]
*  Unless they're like directly a Zionist opp or simply someone who is motivated for personal political gains. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=488.32s)]
*  Maybe they want to maybe they're Fatah. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=499.32s)]
*  Maybe they want to fucking join the PA or whatever. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=501.28s)]
*  But why are you putting words in their mouths? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=503.28s)]
*  You literally know nothing. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=505.28s)]
*  What? What are you talking about? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=507.28s)]
*  I'm not I'm not denying that there is discontent towards Hamas and the Gaza Strip. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=509.28s)]
*  I'm not putting words in their mouth at all. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=513.28s)]
*  I mean, the notion who told you that the Palestinians I talked to the Palestinians I read they're online. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=515.28s)]
*  The Palestinians in Gaza, the Palestinians from Gaza that have escaped Gaza. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=523.28s)]
*  My bad. I should have just listened to Channel 4 or Times of Israel instead. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=527.24s)]
*  No, but this is not accurate 100%. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=531.24s)]
*  What is accurate? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=533.24s)]
*  What is inaccurate? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=535.24s)]
*  Is that chatter Palestinian? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=537.24s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=539.24s)]
*  I think it's Turkish. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=541.24s)]
*  He's going to go nuts about this. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=543.24s)]
*  I don't give a fuck. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=545.24s)]
*  Fuck Ethan. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=547.24s)]
*  His family says the killers were affiliated to the group's military wing and they're demanding retribution. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=549.24s)]
*  Well, I've been speaking. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=551.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=553.24s)]
*  Abu Abu Bakr Abed is another example. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=555.24s)]
*  I want to make it clear. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=557.24s)]
*  Only Israel is behind my suffering. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=559.24s)]
*  Israel's destroyed, bombed, killed and starved Gaza. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=561.24s)]
*  Only Israel. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=563.24s)]
*  Israel is the root of my pain. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=565.24s)]
*  Israel is the generator of our catastrophe. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=567.24s)]
*  Only Israel and the protests themselves across the board, even the most rigid, even even [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=569.24s)]
*  that dude who was in the Atlantic Council, the one that ironically enough, Ethan or even fucking well, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=576.24s)]
*  Jesus, even worse than the other dude. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=584.2s)]
*  But like most people that are directly against directly antagonistic against Hamas who basically [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=586.2s)]
*  talk about how it's actually not Israel that is the fault here, but it's actually Hamas [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=594.2s)]
*  is a fall here and they're of Palestinian background. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=598.2s)]
*  By the way, those people still say the number one condition is the end of the occupation. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=600.2s)]
*  I like that I'm supposed to not listen to like actual fucking Palestinians, okay, that [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=608.1600000000001s)]
*  are directly still reporting on the ground inside of Gaza. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=616.1600000000001s)]
*  But instead I'm supposed to listen to fucking Ethan Klein who lives in Bel Air and doesn't [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=620.1600000000001s)]
*  know his ass from his elbow and said you have Golan was a good guy or a moderating force [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=626.1600000000001s)]
*  and was like trying to defend that statement up until last week, even after apologizing [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=630.1600000000001s)]
*  for the stupid fucking thing that he had said, you know, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=634.1600000000001s)]
*  the expectation is don't listen to the last surviving eight fucking journalists that are [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=637.12s)]
*  reporting from the ground and listen to instead of a Palestinian dude who works for the Atlantic [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=644.12s)]
*  Council and lives in Virginia or Ethan Klein who is highlighting these these affairs. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=649.12s)]
*  What am I supposed to think? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=655.12s)]
*  What am I supposed to think when I don't hear the cries of horror for 16 fucking months [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=657.12s)]
*  as Israel's killed hundreds of thousands of fucking Palestinians? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=665.08s)]
*  But then the one time the one time I'm supposed to believe that these people actually care [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=669.08s)]
*  about the Palestinian lives all of a sudden. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=675.08s)]
*  I said this during the Al Ahly hospital courtyard bombing as well. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=677.08s)]
*  Sometimes when you listen to pro-Israeli sentiment, it almost feels like they're saying only we [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=683.08s)]
*  get to kill Palestinians. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=689.08s)]
*  Only we get to kill Palestinians. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=691.08s)]
*  How dare they? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=693.08s)]
*  I know I read the the drop site breakdown, the drop site news break down from the other [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=695.08s)]
*  day. Yeah, it's crazy how this works. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=700.08s)]
*  Anti Hamas protest made its made its way to the fucking Joe Rogan experience. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=702.08s)]
*  People that are otherwise like very silent for months and months radio silence months [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=706.08s)]
*  and months for Israeli genocide. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=712.08s)]
*  All of a sudden now are like, yeah, we got to hear from the fucking pro-Palestinian voices. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=714.08s)]
*  It's not to say that these voices should not be heard, mind you, but there's still a fucking [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=718.08s)]

*  regardless of these protests, I think it's pretty obvious which side the Israeli War [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=963.76s)]
*  Coalition is leaning on here. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=967.76s)]
*  Netanyahu said today that Israel will increase military pressure and claim that Hamas [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=969.76s)]
*  will disarm and that his leadership will leave the Gaza Strip. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=973.76s)]
*  So the Trump's plan of voluntary migration of Palestinians out of Gaza will begin. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=975.76s)]
*  This is the plan. They're not fucking hiding it. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=978.76s)]
*  And you want me to talk about what Ethan Klein has to say. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=980.76s)]
*  I'm gonna give a fuck about what Ethan Klein has to say. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=984.76s)]
*  He's just a propagandist for Israel. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=987.76s)]
*  He's Israeli mouthpiece at this point. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=989.76s)]
*  The fuck do you mean? [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=991.72s)]
*  And not a particularly smart one at that either. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=993.72s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu is talking about doing a final solution on the Palestinians. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=997.72s)]
*  And you're over here being like, whoa, whoa, you people are protesting. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1001.72s)]
*  What do you have to say about that? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1005.72s)]
*  OK, yeah, no, that makes sense. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1007.72s)]
*  What do you think? Fucking Palestinians are a monolithic force. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1009.72s)]
*  As Netanyahu says his only his plan is that once Hamas gives up his arms, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1012.72s)]
*  returns hostages, leaves power. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1015.72s)]
*  The next step is not peace, but the ethnic cleansing of the population of Gaza. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1017.72s)]
*  In that light, of course, Hamas would correctly not would not do any of these things. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1019.6800000000001s)]

*  way, for the record. And that's precisely why so many people see me as a dangerous person, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1226.8s)]
*  including including Ethan Klein, opening up people's eyes to the reality that there are no [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1232.3600000000001s)]
*  both sides in a fucking genocide is really dangerous, much more dangerous than the actual [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1237.8000000000002s)]
*  fucking anti Semites out there. Seemingly. Considering he only fucking talks about me. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1242.68s)]
*  Dumb fuck. Well, you're not dangerous. You're just a douche. Okay, yeah, that's why the ADL [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1250.5600000000002s)]
*  targets me and not fucking Candace Owens because I'm douchey and she's actually nice. Is that [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1257.28s)]
*  your fucking argument? Are you stupid? Or perhaps it is more dangerous for someone who is not [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1262.92s)]
*  anti Semitic to actually fucking be an anti Zionist than an anti Semitic anti Zionist because [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1268.76s)]
*  you can immediately package all of that by going, look at what she look at what this [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1274.12s)]
*  person has to say about the Jews. Obviously this person is Semitic. That's why they fucking [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1277.8s)]
*  hate Israel. Brother. I'm kidding. Okay. Funny joke, man. Anytime someone says, what does this [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1281.08s)]
*  do for Gaza? I say, well, it hurts Israel. And that drives you crazy. The poll show that what [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1287.32s)]
*  Speaker 2. 5.12 into Antoine Renard, Palestine director for the world food program who joined [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1292.04s)]
*  me from Daryl Bauer in central Gaza. I asked him what the situation was like after Israel began [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1297.1599999999999s)]
*  bombing the enclave again. What you face is real food scarcity. And what we are afraid is that [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1303.32s)]
*  a number of goods managed to come during the ceasefire, but very quickly these stocks are [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1310.28s)]
*  being depleted. This is the longest period of closure since the start of this war, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1316.12s)]
*  practically 17 months ago. So the challenge that we have, we look forward, we have press one to [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1323.0s)]
*  two days to continue to support 19 bakeries. We have provided our last food parcels to population. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1328.6s)]
*  It will last for a week. So that's, that's really the fear currently in Gaza. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1335.8799999999999s)]
*  But there is a real prospect that this blockade of aid on Gaza goes on indefinitely. There's no end [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1341.32s)]
*  in sight. And that's exactly why we need to continue to plea. So we do end disclosure that [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1350.36s)]
*  AIDS needs to enter into Gaza. That's why it's so important that for your viewers, for us in terms [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1358.28s)]
*  of United Nations and from the Wolf program, we are raising the fact that we are running short [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1364.44s)]
*  of food, that the situation could again be dire. And then we face again. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1370.04s)]
*  H3 was self-destructed and open chat. Appreciate that you let opposing voices in. Yeah, I know. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1374.76s)]
*  And it's so funny because he'll like clip those opposing moments to be like, see, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1379.48s)]
*  it's like, bro, fucking open up your chat to every single person, not even just members. You can't [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1384.28s)]
*  even fucking handle members half the time. Well, I guess now he doesn't have to worry about that [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1391.16s)]
*  because he's already banned most of it. Most of his paying members that now despise him for his [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1396.28s)]
*  fucking unlimited pro-Israel propaganda. What is the final conclusion of people like that? [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1403.0800000000002s)]
*  Like the Hamas is bad for policy. So the genocide is justified or to be expected or that we can't [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1407.88s)]
*  criticize until Israel, until Hamas is gone. It makes no sense. Yeah. I like, I don't know. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1411.64s)]
*  I don't know. Like, I guess it's just anything that, anything that advances the cause that [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1416.84s)]
*  there's like instability amongst the Palestinian population and they're not united on Hamas [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1422.36s)]
*  is a, is a cowardly way to try to say like what Israel is doing is bad, but you know, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1427.6399999999999s)]
*  kind of justified. You know what I mean? That's, that's what it is. It's also this notion that like, [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1433.1599999999999s)]
*  there's always a finger pointing like these guys actually love Hamas, but see, look at these [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1440.6799999999998s)]
*  Palestinians. They hate Hamas. Hassan doesn't care about Gazans. If he did, he would care about [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1444.84s)]
*  these Gazans, which I do. I do care about those Gazans as well as all Palestinians. That's why [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1449.08s)]
*  I think Israel should stop doing a fucking genocide because their bombs are indiscriminate. Their [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1455.08s)]
*  bombs don't go, Ooh, I'm going to avoid these guys due to their political allegiances. Are they pro [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1459.6399999999999s)]
*  Hamas? Are they anti Hamas? I'm not going to kill them. It's no different than fucking being like, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1464.6799999999998s)]
*  well, what about the gay Palestinians? Hamas is killing gay Palestinians. First of all, they're [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1468.28s)]
*  not. Okay. You know who's killing gay Palestinians? Israel is. Okay. If you care about gay Palestinians [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1473.8s)]
*  and all Palestinians, you want the occupation to end. What the fuck? If Israeli bombs knew how to [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1479.8s)]
*  avoid targets, they wouldn't kill so many fucking Israeli hostages. Okay. But they clearly don't [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1484.52s)]
*  have smart targeting capabilities yet. Key challenges related to hunger into the Gaza Strip. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1491.24s)]
*  Who's mind are you going to change? Because president Trump has given Israel his full support. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1498.04s)]
*  There's no sign at all that he's going to change his mind. What happens then? [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1504.76s)]
*  Yeah. Israel killed 83,000, you say 40 children during AIDS celebrations too. And you want me to, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1509.32s)]
*  you want me to talk about a guy who very clearly and very disingenuously trying to do propaganda [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1516.28s)]
*  for Israel like this fucking gross. This is exactly why we need to continue to have the plea. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1522.28s)]
*  There are mediators that are an ongoing negotiation are still happening in Doha. This is why we need [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1529.24s)]
*  to continue to focus on the needs of the population, be the voice of the civilians that are on the [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1535.96s)]
*  ground. Remind also the protection of the humanitarian. So we are able to do our job. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1541.48s)]
*  And that's why we continue to do this plea for the population that's living here. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1546.68s)]
*  We've heard these pleas and their urgency. Is there any sign at all that Donald Trump hears them? [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1551.08s)]
*  Paul two thirds of Jews worry that Trump could turn on Israel as he has Ukraine. That's hilarious, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1558.12s)]
*  dude. That is fucking hilarious. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Fucking right, dude. Yeah. He's any [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1563.32s)]
*  day now. Inshallah one day he will, but he won't. Okay. There's no way it's the very same reason why [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1571.3999999999999s)]
*  it's half the fucking reason why he has turned on Ukraine. Not the entire reason, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1578.28s)]
*  but half the reason why he has turned on Ukraine is because he likes the wrong side of every [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1583.8s)]
*  conflict. Okay. That's what it is. He's like, I like winners. I don't like losers. You got invaded. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1589.24s)]
*  Bye bye. You're loser. You have to be fucking delusional to think that he would. Trump entertains [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1595.56s)]
*  one of the most autistic people on the planet with regular frequency, despite his distaste [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1602.2s)]
*  for all of his actions, because that man has given him $250 million. Mary Maddelson has given [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1609.0800000000002s)]
*  a hundred million dollars to Donald Trump. Sheldon gave another hundred when he was alive. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1618.28s)]
*  If you think that Donald Trump is just going to cast aside his allegiances when he is pay for play [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1624.44s)]
*  through and fucking through, you are out of your goddamn mind. Okay. The guy who said we should do [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1630.36s)]
*  a final solution on every Palestinian living on Gaza is not going to cast aside his, his allegiance [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1637.56s)]
*  with Israel. It is delusion. I wish, I wish you would do that. I wish you wouldn't turn on Ukraine [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1646.36s)]
*  and would turn on Israel. What are we, what are we talking about the fuck? Okay. What you didn't [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1653.0s)]
*  understand? What you didn't understand? We're not here. You and your job. All right. No Arabs. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1658.84s)]
*  Yeah. This is the West bank by the way, not, not, you know, Hamas owner, anything or occupied [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1666.1999999999998s)]
*  here. No, no, no. The Arabs said they used to live here, right? No, no, no, no, no. Nazis [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1671.3999999999999s)]
*  or Hamas, there is terrorism organization live here. Yeah. Hamas, you are Arab. You're Hamas. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1677.6399999999999s)]
*  Hamas. Fuck this guy. Oh, fucking animals, dude. Fucking pigs. There's a good chance [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1686.04s)]
*  he will turn on Israel. Have you forgotten? Awaken the people and help them to see the [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1694.44s)]
*  evil doings of Israel and the United States. May Allah awaken the people and help them to see [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1699.8s)]
*  the evil doings of Israel and the United States. Yeah. Yeah. He's gonna, he's gonna do that any day [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1710.52s)]
*  now, dude. Trust trust breaking many houses. Hamas may lay down his weapons, exiles leaders [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1718.84s)]
*  and handover security in Gaza and allow Israel to enforce voluntary immigration under Trump's plan [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1725.8s)]
*  to reach a final stage of a ceasefire deal. The military pressure Israel's applying on Hamas is [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1732.44s)]
*  working international fugitives for war crimes. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at a [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1737.0s)]
*  government meeting on Sunday, adding that the security cabinet has decided on Saturday to [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1741.24s)]
*  increase operations against Hamas. It's working because it operates simultaneously on the one [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1745.24s)]
*  hand, it crushes Hamas's military and governmental capabilities on the other. It creates the [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1749.56s)]
*  conditions for the release of our hostages. That's exactly what we're doing. And you know, said [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1753.56s)]
*  a muscle lay down his arms, his leaders would be allowed to leave. We will ensure overall security [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1757.16s)]
*  in Gaza enabled the implementation of the Trump plan, voluntary immigration. That's the plan. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1760.68s)]
*  We're not hiding it and are ready to discuss it at any time. He said, he added, yeah. Yeah. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1765.08s)]
*  Voluntary migration. It's going to be totally voluntary. I'm voluntarily. Yeah. When I rob you [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1771.96s)]
*  at gunpoint, you're volunteering to give me your wallet because if not, I'm going to fucking kill [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1778.84s)]
*  you. I already killed your family in front of you just to show you that I'll kill you as well. Just [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1784.36s)]
*  to show you how serious I am. And now you're voluntarily handing your wallet to me. Totally [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1788.84s)]
*  voluntary from our end. This is also, I fucking saw this. It's insane. One of the most insane [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1794.04s)]
*  things I've ever seen in my entire goddamn life. Jackson Hinkle at the Houthi rally in Yemen. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1801.1599999999999s)]
*  Okay. I, I don't know what to say about this anymore. I have no, I don't know. I don't know [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1808.28s)]
*  what to say. Yeah. Tulsi Gabbard's favorite guy who quite literally is pro-Trump. It's making me [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1814.36s)]
*  lose my mind. Like I don't understand it. I can't even, like I can't be careful he will [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1835.0s)]
*  spam your Twitter replies. Yeah. Former Hassan Abiy head, Jackson Hinkle Dink is [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1844.28s)]
*  in front of a massive rally and he's still pro-Trump, which is crazy. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1851.56s)]
*  What the fuck's even his purpose is an asset. What do you mean? He gets to fucking be around [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1856.52s)]
*  like super high profile. If he gets in the rooms with like a high profile, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1883.72s)]
*  Al Houthi family members and shit. Are you kidding me? That's insane. That has insane [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1892.52s)]
*  benefits. God forbid a white boy catch a vibe. That's true. I've, I've been, I've been reading [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1899.32s)]
*  a little bit about what a lot of Palestinians have been saying about him and like warning, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1908.76s)]
*  warning people in Yemen and like, cause he's been collabing with the, the, the Yemeni content [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1917.96s)]
*  creators, right? Like influencers in Yemen and, and the back and forth is like a lot of people [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1922.36s)]
*  have my suspicions as well, where they think he's a Western asset, like a Western state asset, but [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1929.32s)]
*  from, from what I've read, they just say, who cares? Like they're just like, yeah, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1937.96s)]
*  we don't give a shit. He's, he's still doing propaganda. So it's fine. Like that's kind of [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1944.44s)]
*  what it is. I understand that here today, it is, he's the most obvious. Yeah. I play it. No, [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1950.04s)]

*  might not be a fed because then it's like, I'm giving the CIA too much props. You know what I [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1986.92s)]
*  mean? Like it makes me feel as though like the CIA doesn't have this much motion, dude. That's [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1993.08s)]
*  fucking insane. Like getting a dude to be this prominent in the, in the anti-imperialist movement [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=1998.9199999999998s)]
*  is just like, that goes above and beyond. I just don't think that like the current CIA would be [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2007.6399999999999s)]
*  good. I think he's just really into geopolitics, man. There's nothing wrong with having a hobby [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2013.64s)]
*  or traveling. He's like a passport, bro. Not sure why we're making a big deal out of this. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2031.8000000000002s)]
*  Looked kind of like Lollapalooza. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2035.48s)]
*  I'm just jealous. He's not invited. I mean, look, the difference between me and him is that I would [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2095.48s)]
*  get fucking lasered. The moment I, are you kidding me? They put a fucking anal probe in my asshole. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2106.44s)]
*  The moment that I step foot inside of any European country, not even just America. Okay. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2112.6s)]
*  Any moment, like you think you can deliver a speech like this and then have free travel. Are [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2120.12s)]
*  you insane? I would be immediately black bagged. People are saying he lives in Russia now, which [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2125.72s)]
*  it kind of makes sense as to why he can travel this much. I don't. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2133.08s)]
*  And one day we will meet in a free Palestine. He was just doing this in support of Trump's [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2135.8799999999997s)]
*  plan is just two months ago. Yeah. It's just like, doesn't make any fucking sense, dude. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2145.0s)]
*  He's like manifest. That's it. He's not complete until us liberates Canada. Nobody cares. Do [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2152.04s)]
*  please check out my last experience on legitimate targets. If you're not a loser. I like, he [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2155.48s)]
*  literally is pro Trump. He has talked about how he loves Benjamin Netanyahu. Do these guys not know [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2159.8s)]
*  that maybe they like, maybe they forgot when Vladimir Putin was, was prone at Yahoo. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2166.28s)]
*  He was prone in Yahoo here. Where is it? I've watched it on stream before God. I give him [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2174.44s)]
*  credit for going to Yemen, Lamau, but he's very clearly connected. The Russian Intel. I don't [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2179.8s)]
*  think he's a fed. Yeah. I don't know. I, I, this kind of shit makes me think he's probably not an [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2182.84s)]
*  American fed. I'll be honest. I was definitely assuming that he was in, he was an American [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2187.88s)]
*  intelligence asset, but it makes me feel like, you know, who else has a good working relationship [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2196.28s)]
*  with Benjamin Netanyahu? Vladimir Putin has a very good working relationship with Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2202.28s)]
*  I'm actually happier that for the sake of, you know, the multipolar world order that he is in [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2208.6800000000003s)]
*  power right now, pre compared to the previous coalition in Israel, Xi Jinping of the communist [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2214.36s)]
*  party of China has a good working relationship with Benjamin Netanyahu better than the previous [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2219.5600000000004s)]
*  coalition. Yeah. His politics only really makes sense in the context of Russia. Like notice how [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2223.96s)]
*  we showed him with Putin. Yeah. I think, but it doesn't, but it still doesn't because then you [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2229.32s)]
*  have Tulsi Gabbard and you have his like unlimited pro Trump statements. So then it still doesn't [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2235.32s)]
*  make sense. You know what I mean? Like it just, it's mind boggling that a dude who used to say, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2241.64s)]
*  ad break, Dankies in this fucking chat is now delivering speeches in front of the entire [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2252.3599999999997s)]
*  Yemeni population. This also kind of made me feel like maybe he's not an American state asset. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2259.16s)]
*  Cause like, this is not, this is giving too much credit to the American intelligence agencies [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2264.12s)]
*  to be fair. But then again, it's, he's so pro Trump that it makes me feel like he might be. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2270.12s)]
*  I don't know. He's pivoting his opportunities arise in the Russian Intel community is dumb as fuck [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2276.44s)]
*  because his politics are totally incoherent. His policy only really makes sense in the context of [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2280.68s)]
*  Russia. Like notice how he showed him with Putin. Yeah. No, he is like the one co he is, he has two [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2284.3599999999997s)]
*  allegiances, one to Donald Trump and it's unshakable despite Donald Trump's like, [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2290.2s)]
*  despite Donald Trump literally saying he wants to do a final solution on the gossip population. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2295.24s)]
*  How the fuck can a guy who likes the guy who says we want to do a final solution, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2302.68s)]
*  a guy who's like actively bombing Yemen, go to Yemen and deliver a speech in front of the entire [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2307.72s)]
*  Yemeni population. And no one goes, wait a minute, but you're pro Trump. How the fuck does that work? [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2312.7599999999998s)]
*  Aren't the ACP guys turning against Trump because of Gaza? I don't really follow that much dog. If [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2317.88s)]
*  you think I follow the ACP guys, I mean, come on, I have no fucking idea. All I see every now and [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2321.48s)]
*  then is on my Twitter timeline. A fucking what's that manlit, the Albanian manlit and fucking [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2328.04s)]
*  Jackson Hingelding in a Russian tank with their fucking Russian tank operator gear on with their [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2334.68s)]
*  ears flapping. That's the only, that's the, I love that one. That that video is so funny. People on [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2340.44s)]
*  TikTok accuse you of supporting the ACP. This is just Lerushite incoherence. Yes, but, and Lerush [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2346.28s)]
*  was an asset. So that's why I'm like, is this, is this still a Fed op? But then also at the same time, [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2353.32s)]
*  I don't think Lerush had motion to this degree. You know what I mean? It just doesn't make any [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2359.4s)]
*  sense. I don't know. If he wasn't an asset, then that entire crowd would have been pelted by MQ9s. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2364.0400000000004s)]
*  There's no way the bloodthirsty, no, no, the fucking, no, that's not correct. You're wrong [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2369.32s)]
*  about that. The American government is not at the stage of doing what Israel's doing to Gaza [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2375.56s)]
*  in Yemen yet. I say yet. They are definitely, they're definitely bombing the fuck out of Yemen, [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2381.08s)]
*  but not like, you know, they're not bombing crowds like this yet. ACP super misogynist, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2386.84s)]
*  and that's why the recruitment is successful at giving some performative internationalism. Wait, [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2393.56s)]
*  what? No, what do you mean the recruitment is super successful? I think you're giving a little [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2396.52s)]
*  bit too much credit to those guys. Jackson is a Maoist third world is working to destroy Western [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2401.32s)]
*  hegemony from the inside internationally. Lerush did, but also don't over, don't overestimate this. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2406.92s)]
*  Hinkle sees these kinds of things out where the incoherence of his politics don't register when [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2412.52s)]
*  he's there in a nation that doesn't know anything about his politics beyond free Palestine. I would [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2416.2000000000003s)]
*  expect people to do a little bit more due diligence though, before they fucking welcome him to the, [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2419.96s)]
*  the funeral of Hassan Nasrallah or, you know, maybe I'm right. I don't think that they go, [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2425.7999999999997s)]
*  Oh, that's a white boy with swag. He said free Palestine. Let's give him, let's give him access [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2431.24s)]
*  to the fucking highest levels of the, the Yemeni government at a time when America is like actively [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2438.12s)]
*  trying to assassinate the leadership, you know, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2445.56s)]
*  dog. This image is even crazier. Yeah. I saw this. This is, they hit him with the Huthy Ray, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2448.04s)]

*  I'm not like, Oh my God, I can't believe he's talking to the fucking Yemenis or doing this [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2469.8s)]
*  kind of shit. I don't fucking care. I'm not like going to be like, Oh my God, he's a terrorist. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2474.04s)]
*  You know, that's not what I'm doing at all. Make no mistake. Is there a little bit of envy? [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2478.52s)]
*  Certainly. I will even go so far as to say that because I'm radically transparent. Okay. Perhaps [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2483.56s)]
*  to a fault having said that I have my suspicions. Some of the stuff that he's been doing have [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2490.6s)]
*  made me even more confused. And this is my bread and butter. You know what I mean? Like [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2498.68s)]
*  like untangling, incomprehensible, the incomprehensible politics of like insane [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2505.48s)]
*  people is what I do best. So when I, it's like a, it's like a, like a Moby Dick situation. You know [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2513.88s)]
*  what I mean? It's very, very difficult to decipher, but I go back and forth on the, [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2521.08s)]
*  I go back and forth on the, on the, he's a, he's a American government asset [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2531.4s)]
*  thing, especially after this. This is like, I suspect that the Yemenis would be like a little [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2541.96s)]
*  bit more, a little bit more secure. Wait, so you're telling me there's more credibility saying [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxymUc7GAlk&t=2547.96s)]
