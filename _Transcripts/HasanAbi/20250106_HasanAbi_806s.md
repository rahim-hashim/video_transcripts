# Authorities Share Timeline of New Orleans Incident | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4)
*  I just don't understand why bourbon street like this is a dude from Texas. This is something that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=0.0s)]
*  I I just don't really understand. Like what is the significance of bourbon street? It's busy. I know [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=5.84s)]
*  but like there you think there's no busy places in Texas. It's a massive destination. No, but like [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=10.72s)]
*  is that a real question guys? He's in Texas. You think there's no crowded places in Texas? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=17.68s)]
*  Let's move on to the suspect's timeline in the deadly New Orleans attack. Details on the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=22.96s)]
*  just want to remind people that if you were to consider this to be like a [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  disrepresentatized Islamist or whatever right and there's at least some evidence laid out [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=40.400000000000006s)]
*  that this is the case so far. It would be one of the very few [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=47.12s)]
*  domestic people that were inspired by ISIS or any sort of like Islamist movement. If you want [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=55.2s)]
*  to consider it to the overwhelming majority of right wing white nationalist anti-government [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=63.92s)]
*  extremists, which comprise damn near the entirety of domestic incidents on US soil from school [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=71.2s)]
*  shootings and mass shootings all the way to car ramings and the like. Having said that, however, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=80.16s)]
*  the previous government rarely ever tackled it even though it got to such a degree that even [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=87.2s)]
*  under the Trump administration, the FBI kept repeating this point that like white supremacists [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=92.16s)]
*  might be a larger problem for the American government and for the safety and security [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=97.36s)]
*  of American citizens than what we previously thought was Islamicism or whatever. And they [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=102.88s)]
*  didn't really do enough. They didn't really do enough to combat it in general. And I think that [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=108.72s)]
*  they're not going to do that in this upcoming administration at all. If anything, all signs [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=115.68s)]
*  point to them emboldening the people that engage in these sorts of actions with regular frequency. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=121.6s)]
*  Now we have new details on the in New Orleans that killed 14 and injured many others. Trevor [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=128.0s)]
*  Alt is in New Orleans with the latest, including new videos of the suspect allegedly placing [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=134.16s)]
*  explosives. Good morning, Trevor. Good morning, Robin. So Marty grassy's and kicks off today [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=139.76s)]
*  in New Orleans. Officials are really trying to shore up more resources for security, especially [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=144.24s)]
*  as we are learning chilling new details about the timeline of this. Those videos of the suspect [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=149.04000000000002s)]
*  placing explosive devices beforehand. One of them right here in this intersection on Bourbon Street. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=154.16s)]
*  Authorities have unveiled new videos and a detailed timeline of the harrowing New Year's [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=159.44s)]
*  in New Orleans. We have a clearer picture today than we did even two days ago. FBI investigators [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=165.28s)]
*  say this video shows the suspect 42 year old Shamsu Din Jabbar placing a cooler containing an [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=172.0s)]
*  IED on Bourbon Street at 1 53 a.m. New Year's Day. A half hour later at 2 20 they say he placed a [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=178.08s)]
*  second cooler a block away and less than an hour after that at 3 15 he raced down Bourbon Street [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  in his rented F 150 killing 14 people and injuring dozens more and authorities say it could have been [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  even worse. Had he been able to detonate those IEDs he didn't use the right or the correct device [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=199.52s)]
*  to set it off and that is just indicative of his inexperience. Investigators also reveal the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=207.12s)]
*  suspect traveled to New Orleans two times months before the attack filming this video wearing [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=213.36s)]
*  meta-glass. Wait they released the videos he made on the way there. Glasses riding a bicycle around [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=219.20000000000002s)]
*  the French Quarter. They also say in 2023 he traveled to Egypt and Ontario Canada and authorities [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=224.32s)]
*  are looking into whether those trips may have played a role in his organization. Our agents [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=231.28s)]
*  are getting answers as to where he went who he met with and how those trips may or may not [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=236.56s)]
*  tie into his actions here in our city in New Orleans. President Biden is set to visit today [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=243.44s)]
*  to grieve with the community as security preparations are underway for Mardi Gras and [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=248.56s)]
*  the Super Bowl. I have specifically requested through the White House that the city of New [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=253.28s)]
*  Orleans. I just don't understand why Bourbon Street like this is a dude from Texas this is something [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=259.52s)]
*  that I I just don't really understand like what is the significance of Bourbon Street it's busy I [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=265.2s)]
*  know but like there you think there's no busy places in Texas it's a massive destination no but [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=270.0s)]
*  like is that a real question guys he's in Texas you think there's no crowded places in Texas am I am I [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=276.64s)]
*  am I crazy about that I don't even think it's like a massive drinking town on a huge drinking holiday [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=284.0s)]
*  like there's Sixth Street in Austin which is far closer to the perpetrator you know massively [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=288.64s)]
*  crowded with zero other cars or obstacles is very tight streets wall-to-wall with people yeah also [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=296.15999999999997s)]
*  if New Orleans like you have Mardi Gras which would be far more impactful in general so I think [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=302.8s)]
*  that there are a lot of people that are that are patching it together after the fact when they [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=309.59999999999997s)]
*  when they think about like Bourbon Street being a target if that makes sense Texas is too carburetted [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=315.92s)]
*  to have large gatherings and open spaces like this I don't know it was a big college game the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=321.52s)]
*  Sugar Bowl a national playoff sport yeah I that's that's definitely something but I don't know I [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=325.84000000000003s)]
*  don't know why New Orleans B why are you listing ideas for it yeah okay dude calm down assisted [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=331.2s)]
*  with getting a tactical expert in our city this week to map our city for target heartening measures [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=338.08s)]
*  where and how and over the weekend a number of vigils held in memory of the victims among them [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=346.0s)]
*  25 year old Billy DeMayo remembered by his family as a rare appreciative soul every room he walked [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=351.76s)]
*  into he just lit it up with his huge smile and contagious laugh he was just perfect he was just [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=358.64s)]
*  perfect human so President Biden is expected here in New Orleans this afternoon and the [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=364.96s)]
*  mayor says she will be asking him directly about raising the security level and getting [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=368.88s)]
*  that federal security assistance for Mardi Gras just like they're expecting for the Super Bowl [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=373.04s)]
*  George okay Trevor thanks we turn now to the investigation into the news um yeah then then [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=377.04s)]
*  there's also obviously the cyber truck uh situation as well but there was one more thing that I wanted [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=383.04s)]
*  to talk about with respect to this hold on that's just a funny tweet Justin Trudeau's resignation [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=389.52s)]
*  Joe Biden had a silly take the cyber truck one makes no sense yeah by the way the FBI released [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=397.76s)]
*  more info on the pipe from the day before January 6th oh the FBI is releasing more information about [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=404.08s)]
*  his pipe investigation including an estimate that the unidentified suspect oh this is this is one of [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=408.88s)]
*  the craziest ones because one of the craziest ones here is this this guy did actually uh like [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=414.4s)]
*  FBI releases new video of a suspect planning pipe near DNC offices on the eve of the Capitol [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=424.08s)]
*  they never found this guy the January 6th pipe or they never found him he got away straight up guy [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=429.52s)]
*  by which you mean Marjorie Taylor Greene sure fair hoping to generate new tips from the public [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=435.91999999999996s)]
*  the FBI is releasing more information about his pipe investigation including an estimate that the [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=440.96s)]
*  unidentified suspect is about five seven inches tall the bureau is also posting previously on [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=444.23999999999995s)]
*  release video the suspect placing one of the buttons a host of basic questions remain unanswered [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=448.79999999999995s)]
*  four years later for starters investigators haven't determined the suspect is a man or a woman [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=453.2s)]
*  okay more evidence to suggest that it might be Marjorie Taylor Greene fair fair and balanced [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=457.52s)]
*  nor have they established a clear link between the pipe in the January 6 2021 the Capitol by a mob of [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=463.12s)]
*  Donald Trump supporters the FBI can't work on assumptions said David Sonsberg yeah no he just [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=468.08s)]
*  thought January 5th would be a perfect opportunity to put pipe together you know it just happened to [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=473.2s)]
*  be the night before January 6 without being able to confirm as the suspect's identity is very hard [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=479.12s)]
*  to definitively establish motive Sumber told the Associated Press therefore it would be difficult [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=484.32s)]
*  for us to state that there is a link although we can't state there there isn't one in the absence [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=488.64s)]
*  of harder evidence rubbing and lawmakers are right wing media outlets that promoted conspiracy [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=492.88s)]
*  theories about the pipe bombs House Republicans also have criticized security lapses questioning [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=495.92s)]
*  how law enforcement failed to detect the bombs for 17 hours we remain focused on conducting an [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=499.68s)]
*  investigation using all the tools we have at our disposal Sumber said but it is incumbent upon us [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=504.56s)]
*  to follow facts and evidence the FBI assessed over 600 tapes reviewed about 39 000 video files and [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=508.40000000000003s)]
*  conducted more than 1000 interviews over the past four years images show the suspect was wearing a [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=513.6s)]
*  gray hooded sweatshirt a face mask black gloves and a black and gray pair of Nike Air Mac Air Max [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=517.28s)]
*  speed turf shoes with a yellow logo the person also wore carried wore or carried a backpack [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=523.84s)]
*  containing the bomb surveillance video captured the suspect placing the pipe bombs yeah the shoes [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=528.48s)]
*  are actually fairly recognizable where is it there's a photo on here i don't think though i [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=531.84s)]
*  mean i don't i doubt that they'll be able to catch this man but like look at the shoes [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=537.76s)]
*  ball knower yeah he was dripped out the wazoo it seems all those events are planned what anyway [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=544.48s)]
*  Kamala Harris then the vice president-elect was inside the DNC offices when the pipe bomb was [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=551.44s)]
*  found outside the building at about 105 p.m. on January 6 before the bomb was deactivated [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=555.5200000000001s)]
*  then house speaker Nancy Pelosi's motorcade passed by the DNC building and she was evacuated [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=560.0s)]
*  from the Capitol Court in the House of Republicans so Republicans say that like this is so this is [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=563.9200000000001s)]
*  far too sophisticated for a random militia member to do which is why they're suspecting that there [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=568.48s)]
*  this is like a federal agent and they're claiming that this is the feds that were trying to make it [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=573.2s)]
*  seem like January 6 was more significant than it actually was that's their argument [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=579.84s)]
*  this week the FBI is releasing a minute-long video that shows the suspect sitting on a park [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=587.44s)]
*  bench outside the DNC before placing the first bomb there at about 7 54 p.m. the suspect placed [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=590.64s)]
*  the second bomb at about 8 16 p.m. in an alley behind the RNC the FBI says the FBI also was [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=595.36s)]
*  releasing close-up images of the type of Nike sneakers worn by the suspect fewer than 25 000 [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=600.72s)]
*  pairs of the same shoes were sold between August 2018 and January 2021 based on the attire those [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=605.2s)]
*  are probably the most remarkable or distinctive feature when it comes to clothing the suspect wore [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=610.96s)]
*  we're hoping that somebody might recognize that the FBI used surveillance footage to track the [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=614.8000000000001s)]
*  suspect's movements through Capitol Hill on the night of January 5th the suspect initially is [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=619.44s)]
*  captured on video about 7 34 p.m. at the intersection of the first street and North Carolina Avenue the [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=622.88s)]
*  suspect is last seen on camera around 8 18 p.m. heading east on Rumsey Court the suspect in this [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=627.84s)]
*  case did a very good job covering themselves up at the time at a time that this would not be [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=633.92s)]
*  abnormal so it didn't raise any attention sunberg said referring to face masking during COVID-19 [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=638.64s)]
*  pandemic video the suspect was sporadically available and often of poor quality according [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=642.7199999999999s)]
*  to sunberg the 17-hour gap between the planting and discovery the pipe bombs made it more difficult [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=646.56s)]
*  to identify potential witnesses authorities previously offered a reward of up to 500 000 [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=650.16s)]
*  dollars for information leading the suspect's arrest and conviction president-elect trump who [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=654.56s)]
*  returns the white house has repeatedly vowed to pardon some of the many rioters sunberg said he [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTgiaD-WKf4&t=658.32s)]
