# Israel Can’t Stop This | Hasan Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [June 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA)
*  Israel knows it cannot single-handedly deal with Iran. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=0.0s)]
*  The issue here, the issue here is Israel doesn't do shit without America's go-ahead. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Israel's actions, no matter how crazy sounding, okay? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=14.0s)]
*  All of Israel's actions are done with America's go-ahead. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  When are you going to talk about Israel? Very soon. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=30.4s)]
*  There's also obviously some more updates taking place, Israel-related updates. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=33.6s)]
*  Iran has said that they are going to have a swift and very fast response. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=41.4s)]
*  Israel earlier today claimed that they have actually completely destroyed the Iranian anti-air capabilities [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=46.0s)]
*  and have complete air superiority over the Iranian airspace. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=55.5s)]
*  Not entirely certain whether or not this is accurate, but yeah, hold on. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=60.4s)]
*  The Trump, Trump also did the... between Iran and Israel should end. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=69.0s)]
*  Bullshit, okay? The... between Iran and Israel should end. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=72.6s)]
*  Okay, who started it? You know, you can end it. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=76.0s)]
*  You can tell Israel to back down. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=78.6s)]
*  One fact, your Aegis systems can't reload fast enough if Iran sends enough. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=80.8s)]
*  Can't save for Jordan or the Iron Dome, but yeah, but end bad for Israel. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=84.0s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=87.1s)]
*  The Zionist regime has conducted airstrikes targeting, would it believe, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=88.8s)]
*  Iranian ballistic missile systems and radar installations. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=91.2s)]
*  However, most of the targets are decoys. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=93.39999999999999s)]
*  Notice how no secondary explosions were observed upon impact. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=96.2s)]
*  I do not think the Israelis will stop an Arab diplomat, tells me. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=99.1s)]
*  Iran claimed 10 F-35s down. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=103.1s)]
*  I don't know about all that, but Iran state television is reporting [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=105.1s)]
*  that heavy and destructive retaliatory attacks by Iran against Israel are expected within hours. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=108.0s)]
*  Okay, it's the president's birthday and it seems like neither Israel nor Iran give a shit. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=113.1s)]
*  A senior White House official tells me we cannot prevent what will happen today, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=117.8s)]
*  but we have the ability to negotiate a successful resolution of conflict if Iran is willing to do so. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=121.1s)]
*  The quickest way for Iran to achieve peace is to give up its nuclear weapons program. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=126.1s)]
*  Israeli media outlet, Walla, reports that... reports White House officials saying, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=130.8s)]
*  what will happen today cannot be prevented without providing further detail. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=136.8s)]
*  And also, Israel has attacked the largest gas field in the world that is shared by Iran and Qatar. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=141.0s)]
*  Iran has said if Israel attacked energy, they would do so in return. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=146.1s)]
*  Remember, this was like the nuclear option. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=149.7s)]
*  Also, yesterday we covered... [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=154.4s)]
*  Yesterday, we covered Trey Ingst actually showing one of the few on-the-ground media reports [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=157.6s)]
*  that came from a strike... a priority strike target. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=165.8s)]
*  The IDF headquarters was struck. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=170.3s)]
*  The only reason why we know of this is because of a couple pieces of footage, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=173.0s)]
*  because Israel currently is shutting down any kind of footage from coming out, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=179.4s)]
*  and they are demanding on their Telegram channels, the IDF Telegram channels, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=183.5s)]
*  like military command is saying, do not film any of the strikes, do not... [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=187.6s)]
*  And Trey Ingst was on the ground and it pissed off a lot of people in Israel for even showing what took place. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=191.70000000000002s)]
*  Trey Ingst has been up all night, is standing by with all the details. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=198.9s)]
*  Trey, what can you tell us? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=203.3s)]
*  Yeah, Laura, following that Israeli attack against Iranian nuclear facilities [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=204.4s)]
*  and top IRGC leadership overnight and into today, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=209.8s)]
*  the Iranians have responded with three waves of, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  this is Israel's version of the Pentagon, the Kiriath, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=216.0s)]
*  and the building on this compound was just hit. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=218.9s)]
*  Please go back, go back, please, go back, please. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=223.0s)]
*  You can understand here, it's very tense at this specific location, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=225.2s)]
*  because the Iranians are now targeting the defense establishment of Israel. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=229.4s)]
*  And so I'm going to have my caravan pan up here to this building, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=234.79999999999998s)]
*  just across the street from the Kiriath. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=237.9s)]
*  Go back, go back, please, go back. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=240.2s)]
*  And so... [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=241.79999999999998s)]
*  Go back, go back, please, go back. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=242.4s)]
*  Respondent, Trey Ingst has been up all night, is standing by with all the details. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=246.0s)]
*  Trey, what can you tell us? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=250.6s)]
*  Yeah, Laura, following that... [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=251.7s)]
*  Here, go. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=253.8s)]
*  You know how to work one of those, right? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=257.8s)]
*  You've done it already? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=259.0s)]
*  So you're familiar? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=260.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=261.7s)]
*  So yeah, Jonathan Konkukrius, who is a former IDF spokesperson, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=263.0s)]
*  now a senior fellow at Foundation for Defending Democracy, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=266.8s)]
*  which is, you know, the one of the most pro-Israel think tanks out there, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=269.2s)]
*  says, this is disappointing, reporting by a serious journalist, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=273.2s)]
*  working for a very serious network, providing the Iranian regime with live BDA [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=275.7s)]
*  after their attack on Israel is not an international reporter's job. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=279.7s)]
*  Caution and professionalism are called for. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=282.4s)]
*  Jonathan Konkukrius got pissed because a international reporter from Fox News [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=285.2s)]
*  was actually doing his job and reporting on the goddamn news, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=291.5s)]
*  which is ironic because then he shared it as well, just to criticize the dude. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=295.9s)]
*  I don't get it. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=299.9s)]
*  Don't they want to gain sympathy by showing damage? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=300.59999999999997s)]
*  No, they only want to show like residential buildings if they can. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=302.4s)]
*  They want to limit the amount. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=306.29999999999995s)]
*  They want to limit the footage that they're showing. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=309.79999999999995s)]
*  They don't want to show any military targets being hit because then it directly [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=311.5s)]
*  contradicts the narrative that like Iran is specifically targeting. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=316.4s)]
*  Iran is specifically targeting like military locations or areas where there are [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=320.9s)]
*  areas where there are IDF anti-missile systems, like anti-missile defense systems. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=327.2s)]
*  Per protocol, Planet Labs has censored all satellite images covering Israel from today. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=333.6s)]
*  What? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=343.8s)]
*  Yeah, Israel does not want to. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=345.3s)]
*  Israel does not want to show. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=347.3s)]
*  I mean, Iran does this too, for the record, like every country does this. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=349.1s)]
*  It's just additionally difficult to do in Israel because Israel is a Western-aligned, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=353.3s)]
*  Western-adjacent country with a ton of like dual citizens, people who speak English. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=359.8s)]
*  They just don't want to show the successful strike targets because it shows successful [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=368.59999999999997s)]
*  military strike targets because then it's like, well, why was there a military installation [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=376.0s)]
*  in this residential neighborhood, for example? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=379.8s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, then Israel using human shields is going to be a narrative [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=382.9s)]
*  considering that they use it all the time when they're talking about Hamas, right? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=387.8s)]
*  So really makes you think about how we only see military targets hit in Russia and only [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=391.0s)]
*  apartment buildings hit in Ukraine. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=398.4s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, of course Russia is also striking both apartments and also military targets [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=400.2s)]
*  as well. You are already in the protest. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=405.8s)]
*  There is only one king in this country and his name is LeBron. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=408.09999999999997s)]
*  I agree. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=411.8s)]
*  Okay. That's great. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=412.8s)]
*  Israel has asked the United States to join the fight breaking. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=413.7s)]
*  Israel officially requests the US join the ongoing campaign against Iran. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=417.4s)]
*  Ain't no way. What happened? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=420.79999999999995s)]
*  I thought this was their cross the bear. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=422.2s)]
*  I thought they were going to do it on their own. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=423.7s)]
*  I'm shocked guys. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=425.09999999999997s)]
*  I am so shocked. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=427.0s)]
*  I tell you shocking shocking shocking development. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=428.09999999999997s)]
*  No, man, we're good. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=432.59999999999997s)]
*  Hey, I'm gonna go ahead and tell you guys right now officially my statement is no. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=434.09999999999997s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=440.9s)]
*  I'm gonna give that a nah. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=441.5s)]
*  We're good. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=443.79999999999995s)]
*  Hold up. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=444.59999999999997s)]
*  I'm good. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=445.4s)]
*  Thanks hard pass images emerged showing Israel's underground hospitals. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=446.2s)]
*  Trump might leave him out the drive. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=451.4s)]
*  He has good instincts. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=452.8s)]
*  No, dude. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=453.59999999999997s)]
*  Remember I need you to understand something. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=454.8s)]
*  I need you to understand something. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=457.59999999999997s)]
*  Okay, Israel's officially requested the United States join us ongoing operations against [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=459.4s)]
*  Iran particularly targeting underground nuclear facilities such as afford out fuel enrichment [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=463.4s)]
*  plant which Israeli Air Force does not have the means to effectively strike without bunker [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=466.7s)]
*  busters like the GPU 57 a B MOP massive ordinance Penetrator a lot of chatters were saying [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=470.09999999999997s)]
*  that Israel has the the capabilities because Trump had sent specific weapons that you can [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=476.1s)]

*  Okay, wait, hold on. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=534.4s)]
*  We're doing Israel Palestine right now. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=535.3s)]

*  She's a rev com then. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=547.9s)]
*  So so Israel is is your way to close gang. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=549.4s)]
*  Yeah, Israel asking Israel asking for American help was always a part of the plan. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=554.1s)]
*  Israel knows it cannot single-handedly deal with Iran. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=562.7s)]
*  The issue here the issue here is Israel doesn't do shit without America's go-ahead Israel's actions. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=568.3000000000001s)]
*  No matter how violent no matter how crazy sounding. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=577.9s)]
*  Okay, all of Israel's actions are done with America's go-ahead and with America's weapons [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=582.5s)]
*  and America's plans. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=591.0s)]
*  Israel is simply playing a role that America has set out for them, which is precisely the reason why while the United States of America is already actively involved [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=593.5s)]
*  with the munitions and the targeting systems that it's offering Israel America in the defense of Israel, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=608.1999999999999s)]
*  which plays a formative role in obviously how violent Israel can get here. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=615.4s)]
*  Israel can only behave in this incredibly violent manner against a against the Iranian state a regional power with striking systems with missiles [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=621.1999999999999s)]
*  that could truly do a tremendous amount of damage to the Israeli civilian population and the Israeli military command. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=634.6999999999999s)]
*  If they chose to do so the only reason why they are comfortable making these kinds of violent escalations and even striking Iran to begin with is because they have the knowledge [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=642.6s)]
*  that the United States of America has their back the United States of America will defend them and I suspect that the United States of America. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=654.0s)]
*  I suspect that the United States of America will most likely also join the battle as well. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=661.9s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=666.7s)]
*  I'm worried but it's not even a getting dragged into this kind of situation more so that like it's preordained to the US not expect Iran to retaliate. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=670.1s)]
*  Of course they did. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=679.4000000000001s)]
*  Of course they did among the first casualties of Israel's attack on Iran were children now Israel striking civilian infrastructure like oil fields. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=680.5s)]
*  It'd be proportionate for Iran the responding kind but the higher they climbed the escalation ladder the more likely it is that the US joins Israel can only sustain their war [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=686.9000000000001s)]
*  in Iran with a constant flow of US weapons which they're getting and they know they can't knock out Iran's deeply buried nuclear sites without the US but they also know that if things got bad for them the US would have to step in. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=695.1s)]
*  So Israel is goading Iran up the escalation ladder knowing that the higher they go the higher chance they can drag the US in to deliver the knockout blow Israel knows they don't face an existential threat because if it ever got to that point the US would step in. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=705.9s)]
*  Iran's nuclear option is ironically enough not the deployment of nukes Iran's nuclear option is to light the oil refineries in the region on fire. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=719.4s)]
*  Iran has said in the past that if their oil and natural gas capabilities were targeted then they would respond in kind by lighting the entire Gulf oil refineries on fire. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=730.5999999999999s)]
*  That is their nuclear option Israel's nuclear option is possibly the nukes that they have ironically enough but also American intervention Israel knowing that has targeted Iranian gas oil and gas fields. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=744.0s)]
*  If there's one thing you shouldn't miss in this moment says Omar Badar political analyst formerly from Al Jazeera. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=760.2s)]
*  If there's one thing you shouldn't miss in this moment is a carefully planned and orchestrated Israeli propaganda campaign aiming to force the US directly to attack Iran. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=767.4000000000001s)]
*  Despite Israel initiating this regime war regime change war of aggression against Iran and killing dozens of Iranian children so far to say nothing of the 20,000 children they've slaughtered in Gaza. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=776.0s)]
*  Every pro-Israel propagandist is on message repeating a single lie over and over again that Israel is only going after military targets and claiming that Iran is only killing civilians. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=785.4000000000001s)]
*  The plan forward seems clear Israel continue escalating its atrocities against major Iranian population centers and obliterating residential buildings and when Iran responds in kind the propagandist and a pack funded politicians will line up. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=794.5s)]
*  To repeat the lie above and apply enormous pressure on Trump to intervene on behalf of Israel and attack Iran directly. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=807.8s)]
*  We shouldn't be taken for a ride by Israeli propaganda. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=816.3000000000001s)]
*  The problem here is and what I suspect and what I'm fearful of is that America has already decided alongside Israel that they will inevitably get involved because when Israel started this process. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=819.5s)]
*  We covered the sentiment that they were using the narratives that they were using when Israel struck Iran. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=835.2s)]
*  They said a couple key words one that this is going to be a military operation that will last at least two weeks. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=841.3000000000001s)]
*  That is that is very damning. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=848.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=851.5s)]
*  Israel warns Tehran will burn Iranian strikes. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=854.7s)]
*  Or heavily damaged. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=857.1s)]
*  This is not too far from Tel Aviv. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=858.9s)]
*  It's one of the places where these Iranian missiles actually made landfall last night. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=862.3000000000001s)]
*  Several houses completely destroyed at least one man and one woman were killed and you could see a lot of Israelis gathering or as close as they could get to it by the police cordon to try to sort of strain and get a better look because the [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=868.6s)]
*  scale of the damage the devastation that kind of munition is not something that people here in Israel are used to seeing it is something that people who live under Israeli bombardment be it in Gaza or Lebanon or Syria are very used to seeing but it's not something that people are used to here. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=886.5s)]
*  So certainly heightened curiosity but also heightened anxiety and that anxiety is being felt not just in Israel but also of course in Iran and across the region. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=906.1s)]
*  It is just got dark here in the last couple of hours people bracing themselves wondering whether we can expect another night of heavy attacks and counterattacks like we saw last night in the wake of this extraordinary escalation with real fears that at this stage there's [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=915.8s)]
*  nothing really to bring both sides back from the brink. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=935.6s)]
*  There's no real off ramp in sight Jessica. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=939.2s)]
*  So there is one real off ramp. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=942.4s)]
*  It's America. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=944.5s)]
*  But considering that the United States of America is also a partner in this and Israel doesn't do anything that America doesn't tell them to do. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=945.8000000000001s)]
*  Okay, I suspect that this is a part of the final stage in America's grand design in the region squirrel said this last night Israel's decided to assassinate Iran Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei to try to cause total state collapse unless Iran establishes the [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=958.4s)]
*  by striking both Israeli and US assets in the region eliminating top figures in the Israeli regime. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=977.4s)]
*  They will proceed the US and Israel did not launch this war to try to eliminate a nuclear site. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=980.6999999999999s)]
*  They know they can't they are too well protected and dispersed any damage can be reconstituted in the short term. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=984.6s)]
*  They launched into they launched the cause total state collapse in Iran beginning in phases. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=989.4s)]
*  The first phase was to eliminate the top military RGC leaders while also going after scientists and mass killing civilians in the process. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=993.5s)]
*  This would create the false impression that they're still somewhat restrained and focus on military nuclear targets after taking what they expect will be similar contrain response from Iran. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=999.1999999999999s)]
*  They will see that as a confirmation that Iran will not adhere to its own stated red lines and is still afraid of meeting Israel at the same level of escalation. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1007.3s)]
*  That is their green light to proceed to the next phase, which is the target and kill top political leaders including Khamenei. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1014.3s)]
*  Their hope isn't to replace the current government and state with some rehash of the monarchist Zionist fascist through his fail son. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1019.3s)]
*  They know there's no basis support for that inside the country. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1024.7s)]
*  Their hopes to do another Libya and Syria unleash proxy forces. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1027.4s)]
*  They fund an arm together with the Gulf Arab shield puppet regimes and NATO Erdogan and turn it into a spiral of death and chaos. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1030.2s)]
*  A concocted civil war where Iranians are paid and armed by CIA and Mossad to kill Iranians. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1036.9s)]
*  The M.E.K. and other such proxy forces have already been trained and prepared and are ready to be activated. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1041.6000000000001s)]
*  This was all of this so far is fairly accurate. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1047.0s)]
*  I mean I would say they will begin with car bombings and terrorist attacks and mass killing civilians. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1050.3s)]
*  ISIS will reappear again and do its typical job of the CIA and Mossad masters. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1055.1s)]
*  The US and Israel decided to launch this war since before Trump was elected and it has the full and total support of the US entire US military intelligence [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1058.6999999999998s)]
*  industrial complex and the media and political class both Republicans and Democrats and it would have also happened if Kamala Harris won the election. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1066.1999999999998s)]
*  They see Iran and the acts of resistance and its alliance with Russia and China as the main obstacle to full and total Zionist us NATO Israeli imperial hegemony in the region [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1072.3999999999999s)]
*  and by extension the world and they want to destroy it as it is the only one that unlike Russia and China does not have a nuclear deterrent and they want to get to it before it [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1080.3s)]
*  pains it is an existential war of survival not just for the Iranian state but for Iran as a nation if this project succeeds the country will be Balkanized ethnic divisions will be stirred by foreign actors. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1089.3s)]
*  Iran is a tremendously diverse country. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1098.6s)]
*  Okay with multiple different ethnicities existing under one national banner and those ethnic tensions will absolutely be used in the same exact way that they was used in Syria. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1101.3s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1116.9s)]
*  Is there any possibility that the US and Israel will lose this war. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1117.6s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1121.3s)]
*  It seems fairly Iran is not as divided. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1122.5s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1125.2s)]
*  It doesn't have to be super divided. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1126.0s)]
*  What has to happen is is that there is enough trained and armed sectarian divisions that will cause enough violence at the point of complete state collapse. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1129.0s)]
*  Israel is decapitating the state up top with these targeted assassination strikes while simultaneously while simultaneously beefing up political tensions and and and and pushing for [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1143.8s)]
*  sectarian infighting in the region and there is no functioning state. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1158.2s)]
*  There is no way to deal with that. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1164.1000000000001s)]
*  All this goes back to the assassination of Nasrallah Israel had the ability to assassinate him whenever he wanted that is not the question Iran can assassinate in Yahoo if it wants Ukraine can assassinate Putin Putin can assassinate Zelensky. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1167.0s)]
*  I don't I wouldn't say it's like that easy to do assassinations are not the problem every state with barely competent intelligence has the capacity to assassinate anyone is not it's a question of deterrence. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1177.4s)]
*  The reason Israel did not assassinate Nasrallah is because as Golan later came out and admitted because they were deathly afraid of the response by Hezbollah and Iran. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1187.6000000000001s)]
*  They thought it would lead to such a significant response not just in terms of a missile strike on Israeli territory hitting military infrastructure but assassinations of top Israeli officials that they did not go ahead with it. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1195.4s)]
*  They do have Iran does have the capacity to to absolutely attack top military positions. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1205.9s)]
*  They do. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1215.4s)]
*  And Israel has the capacity to kill Ali Khomeini Israel has more of a capacity to kill Ali Khomeini than Iran has the capacity to kill Benjamin and Yahoo. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1217.1000000000001s)]
*  But the reason why when Trump killed. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1226.7s)]
*  Qasem Soleimani the reason why that was considered a real overstepping of a boundary was because you don't do that. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1230.5s)]
*  There is this established notion among global leaders that at most. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1240.8s)]
*  Political assassinations of top level leadership only happens with like random gunmen every now and then and it's it's fairly rare. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1247.9s)]
*  Because it invokes the same exact response in retaliation. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1258.7s)]

*  I know then slowly but surely the deterrence Iran had established was broken now look at the timeline April 2024 Israel attacks Iran's embassy killing many. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1268.9s)]
*  13 April Iran responds with Operation True Promise 1 a symbolic pre signal strike no deaths just some limited material damage 19th of May Israel kills Iran's president Ebrahim Raisi and the foreign minister. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1275.8s)]
*  I mean wait what I don't think that was Israel. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1286.2s)]
*  We don't know if that was Israel. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1289.1s)]
*  I mean could have been that's speculation Khomeini. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1290.7s)]
*  Yeah, I wouldn't know Iran responds by covering up and going along with a lie that was just an accident so they could avoid having to retaliate at all Israeli officials were openly gloating about these killings and his open secret and Intel circles where they were assassinated. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1295.2s)]
*  Israel kills top his Hezbollah military commander for Israel kills a mosque leader honey and does it in Tehran Iran then vowed it would retaliate. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1305.6s)]
*  But genocide Joe slash blink and began a fake diplomacy propaganda the Trump Wyckoff also initiated ahead of the current war Khomeini September Israel does this terrorist pager attack in Lebanon already before this they had begun bombing Beirut which has [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1313.9s)]
*  said was a red line Israel saw this is confirmation that there would be no retaliation. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1327.4s)]
*  I mean some of this stuff is speculative but some of some of this is open in broad daylight right. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1331.3s)]
*  It's coming. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1338.0s)]
*  I come in. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1338.7s)]
*  I is that what you want me to say coming I okay chat stop shut the fuck up chat is literally just being fucking insane. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1340.1s)]
*  I'm going to keep saying come any anyway. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1349.1s)]
*  Ultimately ultimately listen I mean this kind of this this analysis is all over the place a little bit but the part that I agree with the part that I have also stated is that Israel makes calculations on how far they can go in terms of assassinating Hezbollah [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1352.8s)]
*  or in terms of striking Iranian territory directly from what kind of response they will get in retaliation. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1373.9s)]
*  So if Iran's response. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1382.9s)]
*  If Iran's response is restrained that is all but a green light for Israel to continue escalating its response to continue escalating the intensity of the bombing to continue changing the strike targets to. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1387.6s)]
*  Heads of heads of government heads of state potentially as they have done so so far they went in and after the Iranian retaliation they turned around and started hitting oil production gas production if your only deterrent strategy. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1403.4s)]
*  Is a restrained retaliatory response that is more limited than how much Israel has escalated its its violence then Israel is going to continue increasing the intensity this presents additional problems for China as well it is a lose lose situation for Iran it is there's nothing that Iran can do. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1421.5s)]
*  There's nothing that Iran can do in this circumstance because if they were to if they were to you know increase the intensity start hitting if they were to increase the intensity start hitting like heads of state or potentially like you know top military command. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1445.2s)]
*  I feel as though or you know strike. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1462.6999999999998s)]
*  Like cross some sort of red line that would bring America into the into the fold as well the larger the the larger problem here is for China as well okay because the reason why. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1468.3999999999999s)]
*  Iran is is seen as the last big problem that must be dealt with from the American perspective is because they want to pack up the entire region and basically have a monopoly on oil and gas production not a complete monopoly but a functional like almost a monopoly on oil. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1484.4s)]
*  By way of of having the region be dominated by NATO back Turkey and Israel and have complete control and have the rest of the states that are oil producers already as as vassal states which is already the case. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1506.4s)]
*  Only to then find a way to shut out China from receiving oil China currently has a monopoly on renewables and the refinement and procurement of the rare earth. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1520.9s)]
*  Minerals that are necessary for renewables both at the extraction sites but more importantly on the refinement sites so that is a separate economic issue that America is also trying to deal with China also has tremendous power through trade. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1536.9s)]
*  If you were to look at this in reductive terms America has to decouple the rest of the planet. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1554.9s)]
*  And every single trade partner it has every single country that is under its control under its influence to stop doing trade with China. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1561.9s)]
*  So they can engage in a deeper Cold War with China and the other thing that they have to do is to shut off China from accessing oil. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1571.9s)]
*  The last part of this puzzle would be to to cause enough instability in Iran but because of China's lack of interest because of China's restraint and its severe lack of interest in intervention. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1581.9s)]
*  It's non interventionist. It's non interventionist to a fault attitude. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1597.9s)]
*  It feels like China's restrained in this process and its refusal to be more heavily involved in this process could allow Iran to be toppled which will then have long term consequences. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=1603.9s)]
*  For China of course in the process we have RAF jets and military assets being sent to the Middle East as we talked about already there was one I think Naval vessel that was intercepted by Iranian forces a British Naval vessel that was intercepted by Iranian forces.

*  and servile to Western interests. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=2867.8199999999997s)]
*  They're targeting Haifa? [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=2877.58s)]
*  Yes Bernard please if you need to go and take shelter we can keep talking to you. If you [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=2907.58s)]
*  need to go and take shelter because it does look like there's an awful lot of activity [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=2917.02s)]
*  in the skies there and if the air... [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=2920.22s)]
*  The missile authors, the ones that light on fire is it after interception? Or is it on [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=2922.94s)]
*  fire because it's about to fall or is it post interception? [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=2929.14s)]
*  Because sometimes it could be from the sea. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=2937.58s)]
*  They're on fire due to air resistance causing plasma to form around the warhead? Yeah I [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=2952.54s)]
*  don't think it's interceptions chat. We've seen a bunch of those missiles. Oh my god [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=2956.06s)]
*  that's a lot. Oh they are not stopping these dude. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh they are not [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=2962.2999999999997s)]
*  intercepting these at all. Oh my god. Oh my god. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=2978.5s)]
*  None of these are showing shit dude. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=2993.22s)]
*  Wait I can't tell if those are... [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3015.22s)]
*  We're also keeping an eye on... [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3018.22s)]
*  Yeah because those were in Amman bro. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3020.22s)]
*  We're not seeing any impact there. It does appear as if the Jordanians are intercepting [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3022.22s)]
*  a lot of these missiles that are coming over from Iran before they actually reach Israel. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3029.74s)]
*  But this is an extraordinary number of missiles that we're seeing being intercepted in the [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3036.7799999999997s)]
*  sky over Amman. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3041.54s)]
*  Why can't I go back on this? What the fuck? What kind of weird ass YouTube page is this [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3045.22s)]
*  where I can't go back on the live feed? [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3064.22s)]
*  This is the Israelis intercepting them over Jordan using arrow not the Jordanians. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3074.22s)]
*  If something is flying over the capital like that it would try and intercept them and it [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3105.22s)]
*  clearly it looks like something there has been intercepted and has fallen to ground [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3110.22s)]
*  just beyond the city centre. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3115.22s)]
*  And we're just seeing that there are air raid sirens now sounding in Haifa and that is the [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3117.22s)]
*  city that we can see in the big box on our screens just over from Amman where those rockets [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3123.22s)]
*  were destined for a lot of them as you showed us amazingly. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3130.22s)]
*  There's a red bar but it's hard to see. You guys are so stupid dude. I'm literally pressing [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3135.22s)]
*  back. It's not letting me go back. I'm pressing back on the keyboard. I know there's a red [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3140.22s)]
*  bar and it's hard to see. Why are you guys so stupid sometimes? [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3147.22s)]
*  It's very real and can also cause a lot of injuries. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3150.22s)]
*  Yes it can. I mean the air raid sirens will go for a fixed period of time as a warning. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3153.22s)]
*  They don't ring constantly and then there is this audio message but everybody hears [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3159.22s)]
*  those air raid sirens. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3164.22s)]
*  These are streams that weirdly enough don't let you rewind. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3165.22s)]
*  Jordan is not like Israel in that not every Israeli home, every Israeli office block, [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3168.22s)]
*  every Israeli building has got bomb shelters. Every Israeli home must have one and every [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3175.22s)]
*  Israeli knows where to go. Jordan doesn't have that set up really so it doesn't have [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3180.22s)]
*  that set up at all. It hasn't needed it. So people have been told just simply by that [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3185.22s)]
*  announcement to stay indoors and to stay at home and the city has gone extremely quiet. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3190.22s)]
*  There are still cars. It's a busy Saturday night. Look I'm clicking. I'm clicking. There [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3196.22s)]
*  are still people making their way home. It's not working. This was coming. You just got [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3201.22s)]
*  the air raid siren and I would say. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3207.22s)]
*  Lots got through near Haifa. These are the ones that we just saw. Hold on. This was the [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3209.22s)]
*  big volley, the barrage that we saw. Footage posted, social media shows Iran's ballistic [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3214.22s)]
*  missile attack on the Haifa area, sirens in Haifa and across northern Israel. These were [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3220.22s)]
*  the ones we were talking about. I don't know if these are, I don't think these were actually [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3226.22s)]
*  intercepted. This is the clearest. I don't know if it's all, I don't know if these were [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3230.22s)]
*  intercepted and it's just like flaming wreckage or if those are the ones that got through. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3243.22s)]
*  I can't tell. Look, you can see the impact, Chad. Look at least two. Look one, two hit [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3247.22s)]
*  three. Didn't hit one hit two, three. I think it's it's like a couple of them hit like three [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3253.22s)]
*  of them hit. I mean they all hit the ground, but three of them exploded. Israeli Air Force [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3261.22s)]
*  is responding by bombing Tehran. The Air Force is currently attacking military targets in [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3266.22s)]
*  Tehran in parallel with the activity of intercepting missiles launched from Iran. Do you know what [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3270.22s)]
*  they're targeting? I don't know, but that was the first barrage. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3274.22s)]
*  And we had a hint of what is heading Israel's way. Just as you know, the Haifa area. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3278.22s)]
*  I haven't seen anything else yet, but it's still early in the night and Iran has only just [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3285.22s)]
*  announced that it's launched this this next wave. We did see last night that these waves, [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3290.22s)]
*  they did they came in waves. I mean, there's a reason we're calling them waves. They were [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3296.22s)]
*  a barrage of two buildings are on fire in Haifa. Yes. And we even saw people coming out of [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3300.22s)]
*  the shelters in Tel Aviv. So in the first round of attacks, they could be targeting [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3306.22s)]
*  the interceptors first. Overwhelmed. You have to overwhelm the interceptors by sending as [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3311.22s)]
*  many as you possibly can. It's inevitably going to not be able to intercept every single one. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3318.22s)]
*  And then after that, if there is an area like a priority target there, then they send a [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3323.22s)]
*  second round or even in the first round, if there's enough, I assume that there's like a [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3330.22s)]
*  couple. But when you see when you see when you see light flashes on the ground, that is [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3334.22s)]
*  a that is an unintercepted missile successfully striking a target. There is an arrow air [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3343.22s)]
*  defense base just southeast of Haifa. They may be targeting. Yeah, they may be targeting [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3350.22s)]
*  the air defenses. Someone in the chat said that Iranian media has told settlers to stay [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3354.22s)]
*  away from energy grid facilities. I think they saw they might be actually trying to hit the [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3360.22s)]
*  energy grid as well. Scaling up its attacks because it's moved from degrading Iran's nuclear [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3366.22s)]
*  capabilities in Richmond Cape uranium uranium enrichment capability. Those are intercepted [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3372.22s)]
*  intercepted the light stays bright until impact on uninspected unintercepted missiles. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3377.22s)]
*  OK, but some of those missiles literally exploded on the impact site. That is we looked at [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3381.22s)]
*  it. There was at least two. There was at least four. And there's two separate locations that [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3387.22s)]
*  are on fire in Haifa at the moment. So clearly a couple of them got through. 25% of the [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3392.22s)]
*  world's crude oil passes through while Iran needs a Navy to be able to do that. Speculation that [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3399.22s)]
*  is being made by Israel is targeting Iran's Navy to stop it acting to stop it trying to stop [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3405.22s)]
*  traffic in the state of Hormuz. This is Iran's response, though, latest response to Israel's [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3411.22s)]
*  Israel's attack. OK, Bernard, extraordinary images that you've been bringing us there from [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3417.22s)]
*  a man as Jordan intercepts. The problem is Israel's achieved their superiority over Iran. So [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3423.22s)]
*  whenever Iran's launching missiles, the launchers are being compromised and the idea of jets pick them up easily. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3428.22s)]
*  That's the case. Jerusalem, the also latest scenes of Haifa and Tel Aviv as those rockets [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3432.22s)]
*  are intercepted on their way from Iran to Israel. Let's bring back our senior correspondent, Ali Hashem. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3439.22s)]
*  I just want to pick up. He joins us here in the studio. I want to pick up on something that [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3446.22s)]
*  Bernard was saying that Israel is now targeting energy infrastructure in Tehran. It's threatening [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3450.22s)]
*  greater, more extensive strikes in response. Where are Israel's vulnerable energy targets? [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3456.22s)]
*  Well, actually, the attack on Haifa now, we don't know what happened now. We just saw the rockets. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3464.22s)]
*  We saw the interception. But the attack on Haifa was expected. And actually, I spoke about it just like, [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3470.22s)]
*  yes, because over there, the gas fields are located and it seems that this is the retaliation. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3476.22s)]
*  Supporting Iran and going into an unwinnable war is dumb. What do you mean supporting Iran and going into an unwinnable war? [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3483.22s)]
*  I support peace. Okay. Israel is very clearly the unstable, incredibly dangerous participant here. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3490.22s)]
*  Iran didn't start attacking Israel out of nowhere. What are you talking about? What are countries in the region supposed to do? [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3498.22s)]
*  Israel just blows your shit up, strikes Tehran, and then you just have to sit there and take it and then [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3506.22s)]
*  expect another attack in retaliation. This is the expectation. You have to just eat it. Otherwise, you're anti-Semitic, I guess. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3511.22s)]
*  Earlier today said, look, they want Israel has shown every other regional actor that they only respond to military. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3519.22s)]
*  But this official warned it will be a very difficult week for the Israeli people telling civilians to brace for the reality that there will be more damage and more casualties here in Israel. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3526.22s)]
*  Given the fact that the Iranians have one of the most advanced missile programs in the Middle East, we know they have supplied the Russians with missiles that are being used in Ukraine. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3538.22s)]
*  We have seen the destruction. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3546.22s)]
*  I don't think the consent manufacturing is working this time. All the normies are in order. Like what is this happening? Even the right wing ones are plainly aware of who the aggressor is. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3548.22s)]
*  What do you think? Yeah, I think Israel wants this to be like the six day war. Okay. Israel wants this to be exactly like the six day war. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3554.22s)]
*  However, they're not getting the six day war results. That's number one. The preemptive striking is the exact same. And they're at most getting 2003 invasion of Iraq. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3566.22s)]
*  But this time, unlike the invasion of Iraq, this time there is a tremendous amount of enmity directed towards the aggressive party, which is Israel. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3583.22s)]
*  Okay. While I understand Israel is America and everything Israel is doing is at the behest of America. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3593.22s)]
*  A lot of Americans don't feel that way. They see it as a foreign nation, understandably, because it is a foreign nation, technically. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3599.22s)]
*  Okay. So when Israel is doing this preemptive strike, okay, this preemptive first strike in self-defense, everybody sees that now. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3605.22s)]
*  Like most people see that now as like, no, that's completely unacceptable. Why the are you doing this? Why are we even defending you? [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3614.22s)]
*  This is unlike anything that has ever happened in the history of American conflict, modern American conflict. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3620.22s)]
*  A conflict in exchange of fire. It is a war between the two countries. They are exchanging fire. They are killing people. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3628.22s)]
*  But amid this war, there are certain red lines that each side has. And energy infrastructure is one of them. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3634.22s)]
*  And so as we look forward, we can expect both the Israelis and the Iranians to adjust what they're trying to hit. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3642.22s)]
*  And we heard earlier today from President Trump saying that he wants to see all of this conflict end. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3648.22s)]
*  And so the question is, will the Israelis and the Americans be able to say enough or do enough to get the Iranians back to the negotiating table? [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3654.22s)]
*  At this point, that seems farfetched, but this can't go on forever. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3662.22s)]
*  And that is the big question that will ultimately will come after this round of violence slows down and the missile fire that we have seen toward this country slows down. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3666.22s)]
*  People will start to discuss what comes next. And there is a question of if there will be room for diplomacy or if this will just ridiculous statement, by the way, no new wars. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3676.22s)]

*  And an Israeli source telling Fox News today there are three objectives to weaken Iran's nuclear program, to take out the country's ballistic missile program and to stop what this source calls an existential threat to Israel's safety and security. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3695.22s)]
*  And this source says if they're able to do that, they would end this round of conflict with Iran. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3708.22s)]
*  John, it shouldn't be lost on our viewers that President Trump said that Iran. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3714.22s)]
*  That Iran that they would end this round of conflict with Iran. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3720.22s)]
*  John, that Iran is under siege. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3724.22s)]
*  Israel's attacking Iranian cities Tehran and the port of Bandar. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3726.22s)]
*  Our boss are under attack. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3729.22s)]

*  This is earlier today. Israel did this earlier today. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3737.22s)]
*  Chatter. You're showing something from earlier. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3740.22s)]
*  From what I understand, there's reports coming in about Yemen as well. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3743.22s)]
*  Can someone send me real time information on Yemen? [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3746.22s)]
*  Someone was saying that the that there is a in parallel with the sirens. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3751.22s)]
*  Israel's operating in both Iran and Yemen. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3756.22s)]
*  Security source. If the attack in Yemen was successful, it would be dramatic reported Israeli News Channel 12. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3758.22s)]
*  They might be trying to also do a decapitation strike on the Huthy leadership, potentially local outlets report airstrikes targeting the Israeli military. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3763.22s)]
*  Airstrikes targeting Yemen's capitals. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3772.22s)]
*  And I don't understand how Israel has enough manpower to be able to both strike Yemen and also strike Iran at the same time while thwarting all of the barrage of missiles coming their way. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3774.22s)]
*  I really disagree on this one. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3786.22s)]
*  They knew it wasn't going to be a six day war earlier today. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3787.22s)]
*  All Hebrew is published. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3789.22s)]
*  Some version of the following headline straight from the spokesperson's office idea says the Gaza front is negligible. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3790.22s)]
*  Iran is the main front. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3796.22s)]
*  It's all about perpetual war, perpetual violence, not a decisive victory. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3797.22s)]
*  Okay, fair. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3801.22s)]
*  Maybe Israel is not as insane as I thought they were. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3802.22s)]
*  I don't think they're getting the. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3806.22s)]
*  Well, it is now our 12. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3807.22s)]
*  It is more like 2003. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3809.22s)]
*  Well, that was my point. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3811.22s)]
*  My point was that it is basically like 2003. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3812.22s)]
*  As well as wounding another. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3814.22s)]
*  But this time, not a lot of people are on board with Israel or not. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3816.22s)]
*  A lot of people are on board with the perpetrators. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3822.22s)]
*  In a city outside of Tel Aviv, a residential area and the damage from that missile was pretty extraordinary, [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3824.22s)]
*  something that Israelis are certainly not used to seeing here in Israel. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3834.22s)]
*  Many houses were completely destroyed. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3839.22s)]
*  There was debris everywhere. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3843.22s)]
*  Cars were crumpled up and sort of tossed down the street like Coke cans. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3845.22s)]
*  And people were gathering at the police cord and sort of craning their necks, [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3850.22s)]
*  Jessica, trying to get a better look at the scale of the damage. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3855.22s)]
*  Because as I said before, this is just not something that Israelis have seen on their own turf, so to speak. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3859.22s)]
*  So everybody now waiting to see what comes next, whether we will get further alerts, [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3867.22s)]
*  whether they will hear those sirens, which are an indication that in 90 seconds you should try to take shelter. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3873.22s)]
*  In your nearest possible shelter. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3879.22s)]
*  And of course, we'll keep you posted as and when we hear more. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3882.22s)]
*  Yeah. And one quick note, Clarissa, to your point about Israelis not really experiencing this point, [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3886.22s)]
*  you had mentioned the notification system has been altered as well, [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3891.22s)]
*  kind of underscoring how serious this moment is for that for those people in that country. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3894.22s)]
*  There's now like four steps. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3899.22s)]
*  So this is this warning that just came out as the warning before the warning. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3901.22s)]
*  Then there's another one at 15 minutes, another one at 10 minutes, another one at 90 seconds, [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3907.22s)]
*  and then a final one to tell you that you can come out of the shelter. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3911.22s)]
*  So they're taking every precaution because when you look at the damage that's done with this kind of a ballistic missile, [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3915.22s)]
*  as opposed to the damage that we're more used to seeing here in Israel from a Catoosia rocket or from a mortar, for example, [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3921.22s)]
*  you can see that this is an entirely different ballgame. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3929.22s)]
*  And particularly with regards to the area that we visited today, which is a civilian area. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3932.22s)]
*  There's also, I think, a broader concern that effectively with this massive escalation [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3936.22s)]
*  and with Israel's actions inside Iran that the refinery and that it's not necessary. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3941.22s)]
*  What the is going on? [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3950.22s)]
*  Evil on Gourmet Searching for Spain Sunday at nine on CNN. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3951.22s)]
*  Clear program and also on degrading Iran's ability to respond. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3954.22s)]
*  They were military command and control, military leadership, and then ballistic missile units and ballistic missile commanders and leadership. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3960.22s)]
*  And now it appears that in addition to energy infrastructure, the Israelis are really targeting Iranian air defenses. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3968.22s)]
*  That argues that Israel's in this for a longer air campaign that they want to be able to have manned aircraft. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3975.22s)]
*  And Yahoo said as much they want manned aircraft flying over Iran, [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3982.22s)]
*  hitting a larger array of targets with with larger caliber or larger payload munition, [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3986.22s)]
*  then you can get on, for instance, a drone or some ballistic missiles. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3991.22s)]
*  So this does to me. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3995.22s)]
*  It pretends that the Israelis have a longer, more ambitious operation in mind militarily this time. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=3997.22s)]
*  And what would those ambitions be? [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4003.22s)]
*  What does this tell you about what and what Netanyahu's ultimate aim in Iran is? [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4005.22s)]
*  That's the problem, right? [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4010.22s)]
*  I mean, you've got a military objective, but then, you know, every country goes to war for act for political objectives, right? [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4011.22s)]
*  You're in pursuit of some political goal. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4019.22s)]
*  And so in the same way that Israel, Russia found this out in Syria, Israel has found this out in Gaza. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4022.22s)]
*  The U.S. has found this out in several of its military campaigns. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4029.22s)]
*  Destroying an enemy militarily doesn't necessarily lead you to the political goals you want. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4032.22s)]
*  So Israel looks like it's determined to set the Iranian nuclear program back as far as possible, destroy Iran's ballistic missile and to the extent possible its drone making and launching capabilities and destroy Iran's air defense capabilities, [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4037.22s)]
*  which would leave Iran vulnerable to further Israeli strikes and further escalation. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4052.22s)]
*  And I assume that the thinking, the objective in inside the Israeli government is if they can achieve that, then they can impose some sort of settlement on Iran that Iran will have no choice but to go along with because most of its defenses will have been eroded. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4057.22s)]
*  The problem is every enemy, every adversary can always move from a conventional to an unconventional or symmetric to an asymmetric response. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4074.22s)]
*  And that can involve terrorism, proxy groups, cyber attacks. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4082.22s)]
*  And so the conflict could expand in those directions as well. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4086.22s)]
*  The target of the attack is the Nile man Mohammed al-Ahmadi, the Houthi chief of staff. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4089.22s)]
*  The results of the attack are being examined. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4093.22s)]
*  The U.S. is also hopeful that this can force Tehran back to the negotiating table or to the negotiating table and that then we can have a diplomatic solution to the nuclear program. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4096.219999999999s)]
*  I mean, Trump is saying that this is what he is hoping for, even as Israel is striking Iran and Iran is saying that talks are canceled and negotiations are off. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4109.22s)]
*  Yeah. And, you know, it doesn't mean talks are canceled forever. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4119.22s)]
*  I think we have to see how this latest round of escalations goes. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4122.22s)]
*  If it does, if it does peak and then sort of settle down or settle out in the violence, it ends or at least is lowered, then I think it's possible the U.S. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4126.22s)]
*  and Iran could could sit down again for this sixth round of negotiation that was supposed to happen this weekend in Oman. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4139.22s)]
*  But I think for the for the regime in Tehran, for the government in Tehran, for that to happen, it can't be seen to have been defeated by Israel. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4147.22s)]
*  It can't be seen to have been rendered militarily almost defenseless and then come into the into a negotiation with the U.S. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4158.22s)]
*  on its nuclear program, because it has to get something. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4167.22s)]
*  It has to it has to emerge from this latest escalation with Israel, with its trite to say pride or honor. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4171.22s)]
*  But it has to there has to be an off ramp, I think, for the Iranians to come back to the table. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4180.22s)]
*  And where the chatter is saying to the gasoline after the other in Tehran, do you have any do you have any footage of that? [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4185.22s)]
*  Putin has held a phone call with the U.S. President Donald Trump and those discussions focused on escalating tensions between Israel and Iran. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4190.22s)]
*  Putin condemned Israel's attacks against Iran and the two leaders have not ruled out a return to the negotiation table to reach a deal on Iran's nuclear program. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4198.22s)]
*  Trump reportedly told Putin that U.S. negotiators are ready to resume work with Iranian representatives. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4208.22s)]
*  Let's bring in Kimberly in Washington, D.C. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4215.22s)]
*  So we had Trump calling or speaking to Putin and calling for an end to the war between Israel and Iran. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4218.22s)]
*  But it must be seen within the context of that conversation where he's also calling for a war between Ukraine and Russia, but not actually charting a path as to how to go about that. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4225.22s)]
*  Right. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4236.22s)]
*  And, you know, what's interesting is that in the call with Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump earlier on Saturday, the Russian president offered to mediate to end the conflict between Israel and Iran. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4238.22s)]
*  But it appears Donald Trump, at least in his Truth Social post, has not accepted that invitation. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4253.22s)]
*  Instead, how he ended his own Truth Social post is saying that he should he feels as I do that Israel's war in Iran should end, to which I explained his war should also end. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4259.22s)]
*  In other words, Donald Trump said that he wanted the war between Russia and Ukraine to end on day one, that he could do that. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4270.22s)]
*  Clearly that hasn't happened. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4278.22s)]
*  The New York Times has reported that in Tehran there's mass gas clouds everywhere. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4279.22s)]
*  Things are still ongoing. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4283.22s)]
*  Yes, the Yemen one was a top Houthi commander. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4285.22s)]
*  I already I already covered that. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4288.22s)]
*  They tried to Ursula von der Leyen. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4290.22s)]
*  They tried to assassinate the chief of staff with the leader of Turkey, the Houthis. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4292.22s)]
*  So he's been fairly busy ahead of what we know is going to be the military parade to mark the 250th birthday of the army, as well as it's also Donald Trump's birthday today. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4296.22s)]
*  Just quickly, what came out of those calls with the EU chief, she really underscored the concern about the impact of the war between Israel and Iran being and having an effect on energy markets. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4309.22s)]
*  And already we've seen that here in the United States. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4324.22s)]
*  And she said that there needs to be close coordination in order to keep an eye on that spiraling situation with regard to Turkey's president and the call there. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4327.22s)]
*  What we know is that he said, as we heard from the Russian president as well, that he believes diplomacy is the only way to end what is quickly an escalation in the Middle East. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4337.22s)]
*  And he says that Ankara is ready to do its part, just as we know the Russian president also offered similar proposals in order to end this conflict. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4349.22s)]
*  Kimberly, if we just take a step back for a moment and look at the state of play across America, how split is Trump's administration on this war that Israel has launched against Iran? [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4361.22s)]
*  It's caused a real schism between the sort of traditional neoconservative Republicans and then the sort of newer MAGA Republicans, kind of Trump's core supporters that make America great again movement. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4376.22s)]
*  And here's why. Look, the bottom line is that the neocons are staunch supporters of Israel, have been for generations. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4390.22s)]
*  This is where a lot of that funding from Congress gets approved through these. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4400.22s)]
*  They're very lockstep with lobby groups like APAC here in the United States. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4405.22s)]
*  But things are changing in the U.S. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4411.22s)]
*  As money grows tighter, as inflation increases, things are very difficult for ordinary Americans. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4414.22s)]
*  So those core Trump supporters are saying, look, we can't afford another foreign conflict. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4421.22s)]
*  We don't want to be involved and we don't want to be dragged into something because of this ironclad support for Israel. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4426.22s)]
*  So there's a really a growing divide. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4433.22s)]
*  And we should point out that's also echoing what the left is saying as well in terms of the Democrats. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4435.22s)]
*  There is no real significant internal conflict as far as I understand. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4441.22s)]
*  I could be wrong. Within the Republican Party, there isn't even internal conflict between the Democrats and the Republicans on this issue. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4447.22s)]
*  The single quote disproves this divide. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4457.22s)]
*  Sorry, this time yesterday, we were also speaking to you on the phone in a shelter. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4461.22s)]
*  It seems that this is going to be another long night of attacks. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4466.22s)]
*  There's a good sense it may, but they actually just let us out, which is not a promising sign as far as Israeli preparedness is concerned. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4471.22s)]
*  There have been various complaints, very consistent complaints about Israel's early notification system regarding incoming missiles. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4482.22s)]
*  Our home front command issued a very complicated system of alerts, which nobody understands. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4491.22s)]
*  And the general sense that nobody's looking out for the general possibility. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4497.22s)]
*  For the record, voters don't matter. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4503.22s)]
*  Voters, in their opinion, does not matter, especially when it comes to foreign policy. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4507.22s)]
*  Your opinions have never mattered. Democrat, Republican, does not matter. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4516.22s)]
*  Literally, completely inconsequential. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4523.22s)]
*  I mean here. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4531.22s)]
*  Thank you, Representative Jeffries says a bag. It's clearly the Iranian regime pose a grave threat to the entire free world. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4533.22s)]
*  There are no services where Iran can be permitted to become a nuclear power. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4539.22s)]
*  It matters if we are willing to get out on the street and that will happen if the U.S. military tries to invade Iran. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4550.22s)]
*  Trust me on that again. They would have no support for that. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4554.22s)]
*  I know. Barring like a Psyop 9-11 style outcome, [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4556.22s)]
*  Barring like a 9-11 style outcome, like a, like a false flag operation or some shit. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4560.22s)]
*  There is no, there is only disagreements about going to war with Iran. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4567.22s)]
*  Americans are broadly completely against this. They do not want it. They do not want it at all. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4575.22s)]
*  The past hour we're headed towards Haifa. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4583.22s)]
*  First of all, do you know if any of them struck that port city and if they did, what would they have been targeting? [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4587.22s)]
*  They would have been targeting the immense refineries near the port of Haifa, the port of Haifa itself, but mostly the immense refineries, [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4594.22s)]
*  which fits the tit for tat model that seems to be developing here. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4602.22s)]
*  Israel attacked a gas field in the open sea today off Iran's shore. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4607.22s)]
*  So the Iranians are trying to attack the refineries, caused a massive fire. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4614.22s)]
*  There are also very big chemical plants in Haifa port. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4618.22s)]
*  I think that's what they were targeting. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4622.22s)]
*  Hezbollah attempted to hit those targets as well as it fired on the Israeli north. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4624.22s)]
*  To the best of my knowledge, I haven't heard of any falls or strikes as of yet, but the night is young. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4628.22s)]
*  It is. What other vulnerable assets, energy assets in Israel might come under attack tonight, do you think? [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4636.22s)]
*  There's no real way of telling. We've got a huge gas rig. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4646.22s)]
*  Remember, chatters were telling me that these weren't impacts. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4652.22s)]
*  A little south of Haifa that's probably a very lucrative target for the Iranians. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4655.22s)]
*  But I think the Iranians seem to know where they want to strike. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4661.22s)]
*  The strikes yesterday at Tel Aviv actually managed to hit the Kiryabes, [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4666.22s)]
*  where Israel's Ministry of Defense and IDF High Command are located, even if the damage caused was relatively minor. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4671.22s)]
*  So again, while the Iranians sat there and took Israel's bombings for about 16 or 17 hours on the first day, [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4678.22s)]
*  it seems like they're using their limited resources. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4687.22s)]
*  This is Tehran. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4690.22s)]
*  There is, dare I say it, professionalism. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4691.22s)]
*  You say earlier that Israelis are confused by the system of alerts and feel that they very much have to look after themselves, [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4696.22s)]
*  that the government is not doing that job for them. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4705.22s)]
*  However, how much faith and trust do the Israelis have in the Iron Dome system, [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4708.22s)]
*  which keeps out most of these rockets and stops them from impact? [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4713.22s)]
*  This isn't about that. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4717.22s)]
*  I think the Iron Dome is not the system that's being deployed massively here. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4719.22s)]
*  The Iron Dome is not all missiles. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4723.22s)]
*  There are various other interception systems, including partially the Iron Dome. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4726.22s)]
*  But I think the important point, as far as I'm concerned, is that Israelis are extremely ambivalent. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4731.22s)]
*  On the one hand, again, there's mass support, very broad consensus that this was a timely strike and Israel should go after Iran [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4742.22s)]
*  because Iran wants to destroy Israel. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4749.22s)]
*  That's the official narrative. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4751.22s)]
*  On the other hand, there's a sense that nobody really has any clear idea of what's happening. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4753.22s)]
*  Israelis know that this strike was not meant and is not capable of destroying the Iranian nuclear program. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4759.22s)]
*  They realize that this is an idea. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4766.22s)]
*  I admit that Iranian response, albeit restrained, more restrained than I think Israel, [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4768.22s)]
*  more restrained than I think is necessary for Israel to really reconsider striking Iran over and over again and escalating, [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4775.22s)]
*  has been a lot more effective than I thought it would be the first couple of days. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4783.22s)]
*  Like the first day, the first day I thought was fairly limited. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4788.22s)]
*  And it led me to believe that falsely. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4794.22s)]
*  It led me to believe that Israel might have actually successfully taken out a decent number of the missile systems they have. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4799.22s)]
*  This is in Tehran, by the way, they're burning the refineries. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4807.22s)]
*  Israel has struck one of the oil refineries. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4810.22s)]
*  The main fuel depot in Tehran was hit. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4813.22s)]
*  I feel I feel like Israel wants the rockets to go through the barrier to have a better causes belly. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4815.22s)]
*  No, no, it doesn't. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4819.22s)]
*  No, it would be in Israel's best interest to showcase how strong their defenses are to be like we can keep bombing Tehran and not even get a lick of penalty for it. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4820.22s)]
*  Also, Saudi Arabia came out with the classic pussy ass statement being like, Hey, please, please, please do not destroy us. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4832.22s)]
*  Iran, we would not want the smoke. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4842.22s)]
*  Please don't touch our oil refineries. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4845.22s)]
*  We want peace. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4846.22s)]
*  We want peace. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4847.22s)]
*  Even though, you know, they have they have obviously shown their true hand. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4849.22s)]
*  So nothing that the Saudi government says right now is is meaningful in my opinion. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4855.22s)]
*  So when you hear stuff like that from the Saudi government, remember, it's just bullshit. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4862.22s)]
*  It's ass covering. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4866.22s)]
*  They just don't want the refineries to burn. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4867.22s)]
*  They don't want to contain the escalation because all these countries in the region see that they might be impacted, affected, harmed by all this escalation around them. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4869.22s)]
*  It's not easy to keep this fire contained inside Iran. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4882.22s)]
*  Iran is a big country. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4887.22s)]
*  Iran is on at least three seas. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4888.22s)]
*  It's on the Gulf Caspian Sea in the north. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4892.22s)]
*  You have the Indian Ocean in the south and the Arabian Sea. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4895.22s)]
*  So four seas. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4898.22s)]
*  And at the same time, it has borders with several countries. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4900.22s)]
*  So there are going to be a lot of, let me say, leaks. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4903.22s)]
*  It's not it's not easy to prevent the spill. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4909.22s)]
*  It might happen. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4913.22s)]
*  So all these countries would want to contain this. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4914.22s)]
*  And they can see clearly that this war is after 48 hours is getting out of control. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4917.22s)]
*  How might they contain it? [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4924.22s)]
*  What is available to them? [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4927.22s)]
*  Well, the strategic relations with the United States of America that regional leaders have, Amir of Qatar, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4929.22s)]
*  And now, of course, Qatar's good relations with Iran. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4940.22s)]
*  They can can use that also Saudi Arabia. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4944.22s)]
*  But the end there should be two sides to Tango. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4948.22s)]
*  The other side, which is what the United States should be able also to talk to the Israelis, to convince the Israelis, to bring the Israelis down the tree. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4952.22s)]
*  Because if this is going to continue, this is going to be a long war of attrition. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4959.22s)]
*  And I just take from our culture, the Arabic culture and even Persian and Turkish. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4964.22s)]
*  We use part of a parable on biting the fingers who shouts first. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4971.22s)]
*  The problem is that both sides aren't going to shout any soon. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4976.22s)]
*  So if this is going to continue, it's going to end with both sides just eating the fingers of each other. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4979.22s)]
*  Because we're not seeing enough pressure or any pressure coming from the United States, are we? [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4985.22s)]
*  I mean, we're hearing Trump. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4992.22s)]
*  I wonder why to what Israel is doing, but there's almost like this is their plan. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4994.22s)]
*  A message coming out of the Trump administration that they crafted alongside Israel. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=4998.22s)]
*  If we take it from a transactional point of view, it's an investment. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5002.22s)]
*  And he wants to see how much this investment is going to bring him, at least on the table, because this is going to be used on the negotiation table. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5006.22s)]
*  And it's we can we can say that this is negotiation with fire. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5015.22s)]
*  Is Iran going to give up on its whole program? [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5019.22s)]
*  Is Iran going to accept stop and stop in which uranium inside Iran? [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5024.22s)]
*  Now, I don't know, actually, if this war is going to end with the same status quo that was before the war, because after this war, we would have a different Middle East with either Iran weakened or Iran falling or Iran being strong once again and reviving the axis it used to have and the influence it used to have. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5029.22s)]
*  So there's going to be a new a new picture. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5056.22s)]
*  And that's why the negotiation table that exists right now. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5059.22s)]
*  Yeah. The other side of the story is that with all with all of the regional with all of the regional populations, if Iran is capable of surviving this, if Iran is capable of surviving this, they will have tremendous reach. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5065.22s)]
*  Like they will be the most domineering power in the region. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5084.22s)]
*  Like the whole elevated sectarian Sunni Shia divide is just so negligible. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5090.22s)]
*  It's not significant at all. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5098.22s)]
*  The only people that care about that shit are like the Saudis. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5100.22s)]
*  The only people that actually play any. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5104.22s)]
*  The only people that actually play any role within this are people in power. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5107.22s)]
*  Like the populations don't care. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5113.22s)]
*  Obviously, in the entire Muslim world, Yemen and the Ansar Allah movement has reached God like status. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5115.22s)]
*  Any Muslim you talk to and remember the Ansar Allah movement is entirely comprised of the Zaydi Shia Houthi family. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5125.22s)]
*  Okay, they're Shia. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5135.22s)]
*  But if you go to any fucking Sunni Muslim anywhere around the planet, they will say they stand with Yemen. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5137.22s)]
*  They love Yemen. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5143.22s)]
*  They love Ansar Allah. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5144.22s)]
*  Iran, obviously in the eyes of a lot of Sunni Muslims, is still a terrifying country of tremendous influence because they have seen they've seen Iran attack other region. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5146.22s)]
*  Many of them Salafis, but still, if Iran is able to survive this intense bombardment campaign with even, I mean, with obviously some significant penalties incurred, [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5161.22s)]
*  I think the rest of the Muslim world, not the leadership, but the rest of the Muslim world will see them as gods. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5178.22s)]
*  Because we have been hearing reports that Israel will be striking the city. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5187.22s)]
*  Well, you know, from last night, specifically, you know, from the late in the evening, we have been hearing the air defense in Iran being operating, you know, actively. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5192.22s)]
*  And the but the first night that we have the attack happened, you know, this was not like this, but it has been increasing the activity of the air defense. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5207.22s)]
*  But in the meantime, you know, there have been back and forth between the suicide with Iran, you know, launching moments ago, any round of missile attack against Israel. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5218.22s)]
*  What we have been hearing from the Iranian side is that this is expected to be continued. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5229.22s)]
*  Obviously, the likely outcome is eventually after a tremendous escalation, which has already started on the Israeli side. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5235.22s)]
*  They're burning the oil refineries and depots in the capital of Tehran. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5242.22s)]
*  But beyond that, beyond that, Israel could eventually, Israel could do a decapitation strike like they did with the like they did with Hezbollah. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5247.22s)]
*  I mean, they accidentally engaged in a decapitation strike for Hamas. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5270.22s)]
*  They didn't even know that they killed the Ismail is an entirely different condition, and they have yet to do so successfully with Yemen. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5276.22s)]
*  So that one chatter that said you're stupid. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5283.22s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, New York. What are you talking about? I'm Yemeni and I hate on so a lot of people in southern Yemen as Yemeni is attacking Israel doesn't give you the right to bomb and kill your own people. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5292.22s)]
*  Do you do Yemenis mean nothing to you? Who is what is this? What are these quotes that you're posting? [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5299.22s)]
*  I know Yemenis personally that have had their families on the other side of the civil war that took place. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5303.22s)]
*  Every single every single person from Yemen, regardless of what side they were on in the civil war, [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5315.22s)]
*  will unironically tell you that they stand with the on so a lot of movement. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5325.22s)]
*  And it's not even you know, it's not even like I mean, aside from the feds, I guess. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5330.22s)]
*  And Joel Shifty. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5336.22s)]
*  Aside from the federal agents that are I don't know, like doing propaganda from like Sweden or some shit. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5341.22s)]
*  That's not true. All brother, there are southern Yemen factions that were literally fighting an intense battle with on so a lot of movement that dropped their arms in support of on so a lot in Yemen. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5348.22s)]
*  What are you talking about? My point is in this region, in this region, [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5361.22s)]
*  especially in a place like Yemen, there is an order of priority of who the biggest evil is. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5369.22s)]
*  Yeah, I look see token Yemeni says I'm southern Yemeni my family died in the war. We support them now. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5377.22s)]
*  In this region, there's a high is a high order of a higher order of priority in the eyes of every single person from Yemen, American imperialism and and [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5383.22s)]
*  Israel as an extension of American imperialism is the highest order of priority. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5395.22s)]
*  Even the previous puppet, the even the previous puppet Saudi bag leader till the end talked about how much he was in support of the pro Palestinian movement. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5400.22s)]
*  For the people of Yemen, Palestine is seen as a dual struggle. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5413.22s)]
*  They see it as like the same exact situation in their history, regardless of whichever faction they're a part of. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5418.22s)]
*  That's the reason why I'm talking about Iran versus Israel here as well. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5423.22s)]
*  It was important specific places in order to make it painful for Israel. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5428.22s)]
*  And that's why I think, as I said, it's going to be in different phases and stage operation, which could continue at least for some time. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5434.22s)]
*  That's why I think Iran is recovering and trying to somehow compensate what what happened in the initial stage of this conflict. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5442.22s)]
*  Another of the latest lines that we're getting out of Iran is that the Shahran oil depot has been targeted in an Israeli attack. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5454.22s)]
*  Iran is saying that the situation there is under control. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5463.22s)]
*  Can you give us an idea? A bit of context for us as to where this is and its significance. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5467.22s)]
*  I mean, any from Sanaa Iran's and who these are fucking up in internally. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5474.22s)]
*  There's mixed feelings among the cities with the Palestinian movement recently. United people. Yeah, exactly. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5477.22s)]
*  Also, I'm going to tell you right now, they're going to fucking they are way too tapped in to the global internet. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5482.22s)]
*  They're going to fucking most likely delete the banner. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5492.22s)]
*  I said this literally a year ago, like they're going to go through a internal rehab. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5495.22s)]
*  There's already reports from what I've seen that, like, on so I lost supposed to be a secular movement or whatever the fuck. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5501.22s)]
*  I don't know how real that is, but that always happens. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5507.22s)]
*  But the primary thing that has united the Yemen population is the is the campaign against Israel. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5510.22s)]
*  And these are literally if you meet a Yemeni person in the West, they most likely are from a faction that was fighting against on Sala. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5518.22s)]
*  OK, maybe ask Alda Marki about this rather than speculate. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5526.22s)]
*  First of all, what leads you to believe that I'm not like talking about his reporting on this? [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5530.22s)]
*  If you see people that are from Yemen in the Western world, they are most likely not fucking Zaydi Shia, who the people. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5535.22s)]
*  Yeah, they're usually also need as it's moved away from the nuclear and military sites towards what appears to now be the energy infrastructure. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5546.22s)]
*  And one of those targets was the world's largest gas field, South Paz gas field. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5555.22s)]
*  And that provides two thirds, I understand, of Iran's natural gas. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5560.22s)]
*  So are you seeing an impact or what is the impact so far on these strikes? [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5563.22s)]
*  Well, those attacks are important, but they have not been a major disruption in the country as a result of those attacks. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5570.22s)]
*  And also there have been some, let's say, a limited attack on, let's say, an airport in Tehran. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5578.22s)]
*  But the runway, the facilities related to the airport, as well as the equipment and the buildings are not damaged. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5585.22s)]
*  But these types of attacks also happen in other facilities. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5594.22s)]
*  You know, it could be more or less in different places. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5600.22s)]
*  But the disruptions as a result of these attacks have not been major or I think visible in the country. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5605.22s)]
*  In terms of the diplomacy, Abbas, we've just seen phone calls between Iran, the Iranian president and the Saudi crown prince. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5615.22s)]
*  How what is Iran's strategy here when it's talking to the Gulf countries? [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5626.22s)]
*  What is it trying to achieve? [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5633.22s)]
*  One is that Iran has been insisting on stressing the engagement with regional countries, saying that it has no problems with regional countries. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5636.22s)]
*  But in the meantime, it has been warning those countries who are hosting American forces and bases that if any attack originates from those countries against Iran, [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5646.22s)]
*  Iran will not hesitate to target the source of the attack, including the American bases and interests in those countries. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5656.22s)]
*  And I think additional aspect of this story is that some of those countries have been offering in order to mediate, in order to make efforts to de-escalate. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5664.22s)]
*  This has been coming from a number of regional leaders. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5675.22s)]
*  So it has been, I mean, two sides from points being raised and mentioned from the Iranian side. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5679.22s)]
*  And some of those are the biggest threat to Iran right now is people and Israel is capitalizing on that. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5685.22s)]
*  They're not. I mean, it is. You're right. Under normal circumstances, it is. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5690.22s)]
*  That's what the sanctions are supposed to create. And they have been somewhat effective. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5695.22s)]
*  But the one thing that always happens in unprecedented danger coming from the outside is that even the secular Iranians fucking hate Israel for what Israel is doing to Palestine. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5700.22s)]
*  And the secular Iranians also fucking hate being blown up. They literally live in Iran. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5712.22s)]
*  Why the fuck would they look at the situation and go, oh, no, thank you so much for bombing my goddamn oil refinery. Are you insane? [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5718.22s)]
*  It causes all of the all of the secular audience to really reconsider like how much the IRGC will have their back in this process. You're wrong. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5727.22s)]
*  No, I'm not. You've seen like eight fucking graffiti posts from Iranians living in fucking Los Angeles. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5736.22s)]
*  And you think that that actually comprise that that actually is enough for you to go. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5744.22s)]
*  There's a decent amount of resistance like there is there are there are a lot of there are a lot of fucking people who despise the Iranian government. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5749.22s)]
*  And it makes perfect sense for them to despise the Iranian government. OK, especially if you're young, if secular, there's a multitude of different reasons why you could blame the Iranian government. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5757.22s)]
*  You could say like, oh, well, you could believe the fucking Western narratives and say, oh, well, the reason why they're the reason why our economy is shit is because you guys fucking fund all of this [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5768.22s)]
*  foreign incursion or or because you guys are homophobic. The reason why you could hate Iran is because they are actually very fundamentalist and very repressive. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5778.22s)]
*  Also, does this mean second wave is coming? What the fuck? [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5786.22s)]
*  Those who do not support either of those factions and they also are critical of the same high for sure. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5789.22s)]
*  The government, but they have been calling for that unity against, you know, external threat, specifically the one coming from the Israeli side. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5795.22s)]
*  OK, that's Abbas Aslani joining us on the phone from Tehran. Abbas, many thanks indeed for bringing us your insights into the situation there in Iran. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5806.22s)]
*  Hello there, I'm Laura Kyle. It's just gone. Twenty one GMT and you're watching Al Jazeera. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5818.22s)]
*  Our focus this hour remains the most intense fighting between Israel and Iran in decades. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5823.22s)]
*  A new wave of Iranian missiles has been launched towards Israel as Tehran promises heavy and destructive attacks against Israel. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5830.22s)]
*  Boom. Ardaan reached unprecedented popularity after a fucking failed American coup. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5841.22s)]
*  That took place. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5847.22s)]
*  That took place. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5848.22s)]
*  People in these fucking countries. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5852.22s)]
*  No matter how secular they are, will inevitably recognize. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5856.22s)]
*  Will inevitably recognize the danger of Western intervention and will oftentimes galvanize against Western intervention. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5861.22s)]
*  That is usually what happens. That's what always happens. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5868.22s)]
*  OK, I'm not saying that like the Iranian youth like secular forces within the country are not anti IRGC, anti the the Mullahs, anti Ayatollah. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5872.22s)]
*  Of course there are. It makes perfect sense to be anti Ayatollah. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5885.22s)]
*  They are a fundamentalist force that is incredibly repressive. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5888.22s)]
*  But I think a lot of you are getting your notes from your neighbors here on this issue as an Iranian. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5891.22s)]
*  Thank God. Yeah, of course. Like, what do you mean? [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5898.22s)]
*  We hate Donald Trump. Now imagine if Donald Trump was way, way, way more powerful in terms of enacting his Christian fascist Christian nationals agenda. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5900.22s)]
*  And on top of that, there was complete economic instability born out of the Western forces strangling you. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5910.22s)]
*  Dude, I'm Iranian. I can say, as you said, for Yemen is true for Iran to do. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5917.22s)]
*  People hated the government for not negotiating with the US because of economic issues. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5920.22s)]
*  Now I hear from the most radical people in opposition opinion of government that they say we'd rather die from hunger but attack Israel and do not negotiate on our nuclear power. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5923.22s)]
*  Yeah. Also, the irony is Iran has pursued nuclear denuclearization for literally what? [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5929.22s)]
*  Two decades now. And America has only come over every step of the way. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5939.22s)]
*  This has nothing to do with its like domestic policies or even some of its foreign intervention in the region. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5943.22s)]
*  But it is ridiculous to act like Iran has not tried to for the past three decades, engage in a nuclear war. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5948.22s)]
*  And America has used that negotiations process to continue destroying Iran, destroying the Iranian economy with the hopes that like they'll be able to cross enough political instability. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5956.22s)]
*  If Iran ironically had a nuke, if Iran ironically had a goddamn nuke, this wouldn't be happening. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5966.22s)]
*  English caption. Thanks to Hezbollah. Iran has video intel of high-fa sensitive military industrial commercial facilities as shown in the HUD HUD HUD HUD video. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5973.22s)]
*  Oh, they use the video. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5980.22s)]
*  They use the Hezbollah footage to find military targets. I doubt that these Hezbollah footage. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5982.22s)]
*  If the coup in Turkey was led by a secular figure instead of an Islamic cultist character, most Turks wouldn't have a problem with it, by the way. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5987.22s)]
*  No, that's not true. I don't think so. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5993.22s)]
*  I think Turkey is the funniest country on the planet. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=5997.22s)]
*  My people, the Turkish people are very proud people, but they're also a very servile people. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6003.22s)]
*  Let me tell you why. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6008.22s)]
*  Turkey has the highest degree of hatred for America out of all of the countries that are polled on this. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6013.22s)]
*  Turkey has the lowest approval rating for America. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6018.22s)]
*  It's a NATO nation. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6023.22s)]
*  Turkey has the highest degree of hatred for America out of all of the countries that are polled on this. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6026.22s)]
*  It's a NATO nation. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6031.22s)]
*  Turkey serves America's interests in the region. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6033.22s)]
*  Turkey has the lowest approval rating for Israel, the highest disapproval rating for Israel. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6036.22s)]
*  I think it's like 93 percent disapproval for Israel. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6042.22s)]
*  The Turkish government is an incredibly invaluable ally to Israel. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6047.22s)]
*  This is why I think Turks are the funniest people on the planet, where they're like genuine servants of American imperialism, [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6051.22s)]
*  but they fucking hate Israel and America. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6058.22s)]
*  The population, look at this. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6062.22s)]
*  Look, 93 percent unfavorability, 93 percent unfavorability for Israel. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6065.22s)]
*  And even they do these kinds of surveys on America as well. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6074.22s)]
*  Turkey, again, one of the lowest, lowest fuck of favorability ratings for America as well. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6078.22s)]
*  And yet the Turkish government continues to do business with Israel and Turks are so oblivious to it. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6085.22s)]
*  Some of the gas production there. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6090.22s)]
*  Let's bring in Tohei Dasadi. He is joining us now from Tehran. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6096.22s)]
*  And Tohei, since we last spoke, we have been seeing Iran reporting another attack on the Shahran oil depot in Tehran. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6100.22s)]
*  What more can you tell us about that? [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6109.22s)]
*  Well, I can say that it happened, but specifically when it comes to details. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6113.22s)]
*  So far we don't have, we saw, we don't have that much of information. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6118.22s)]
*  We saw smoke coming out of the scene. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6122.22s)]
*  It was said that the sort of oil storage center was targeted, but still the extent of damage is not, is not that much. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6125.22s)]
*  So it might be a superficial targeting of that place. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6136.22s)]
*  But Darkweaver, Turkey and NATO, the demon is Turkey, not in NATO. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6141.22s)]
*  Is Turkey not a major energy provider? [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6147.22s)]
*  A logistical hub for energy to go by way of Azerbaijan to Israel. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6151.22s)]
*  Is that not the case? What did Turkey do in Syria? [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6155.22s)]
*  If not serve the interests of both Israel and, of course, goes without saying the United States of America. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6158.22s)]
*  As long as there are American nuclear arms in the angelic American military base, Turkey will always be America's lapdog. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6165.22s)]
*  That's it. A lot of Turks will fail to comprehend this. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6177.22s)]
*  They will cope. They will act as though Erdogan is a separate entity, that Erdogan is independent, that he plays both sides. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6181.22s)]
*  And the irony, of course, is Erdogan is playing both sides sometimes. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6188.22s)]
*  But ultimately, he only does that at the behest of America. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6192.22s)]
*  Erdogan, just like every other Turkish leadership in perpetuity, will forever serve American empire. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6197.22s)]
*  But Turks will cope when I bring this up. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6204.22s)]
*  Look at this Turk. He says, we don't want to end up like Iran. That's why we have to be a loyal servant to America. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6209.22s)]
*  See, how is that any different than any of the Gulf nation states? [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6214.22s)]
*  I'm willing to bet you despise them, right? Because you think they're all dirty Arabs. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6219.22s)]
*  That's usually the Turkish attitude on this stuff. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6223.22s)]
*  Unless you're an Islamist, I can't really tell from what you're saying. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6226.22s)]
*  But a lot of Turks have genuine hatred for the Arabs. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6230.22s)]
*  But how is this sentiment any different than the cowardly Gulf states? [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6235.22s)]
*  You say this, acting like you're above them, dog, you live in America? [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6239.22s)]
*  Yeah. But I'm not oblivious to America's evils. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6243.22s)]
*  What do you mean? I'm not oblivious to America's evils. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6247.22s)]
*  As a matter of fact, I'm talking about Turkey's collaboration with America's evils. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6250.22s)]
*  Fiona, stop. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6255.22s)]
*  I'm talking about Turkey, the other country that I'm from, and its collaboration of America's evils. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6256.22s)]
*  And these guys are saying, no, that's not the case. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6263.22s)]
*  The air defense system is activated across the country. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6266.22s)]
*  And speaking of the context in which located and the future possibilities, [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6271.22s)]
*  we talked with one high-ranking Iranian official, a security official, who just told us, quote unquote, [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6277.22s)]
*  Tehran is preparing itself for a prolonged confrontation and will increase its attacks. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6284.22s)]
*  And as I'm reporting behind me, I hear the sounds of explosion related to interception of flying objects by the Iranian air defense system. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6293.22s)]
*  Also, this high-ranking security official told Al Jazeera that Iran did not start the war, [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6306.22s)]
*  but it will determine how the end of this aggression is going to be. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6313.22s)]
*  I'm Kurdish, and I was going to say, no, hatred is not a big thing in Iran, but then you just realize all my friends are conservative. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6319.22s)]
*  Conservative Turks that are kind of Islamist-aligned will like the Arabs. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6325.22s)]
*  A lot of the secular Turks hate the Arabs. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6330.22s)]
*  Even, it's weird. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6334.22s)]
*  Defense system disabled, proven lie again. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6339.22s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think their air defenses are as, I mean, I don't know. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6345.22s)]
*  Maybe they are. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6351.22s)]
*  They're able to hit Tehran like this. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6354.22s)]
*  Trita Parsi. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6358.22s)]
*  I was raised as Baha'i in Iran, which meant being denied access to higher education and treated as a second-class citizen in my own country. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6360.22s)]
*  I was arrested, tortured. My father was imprisoned and tortured. My family lived under constant harassment. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6365.22s)]
*  My sister, my brother, my closest friends, my brother-in-law, we all suffered under a system built on oppression [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6370.22s)]
*  and the deeply rooted anti-Baha'i sentiment that persists in Iran. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6374.22s)]
*  And yet, despite all this, I do not and never wish for my homeland to be bombed or invaded. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6378.22s)]
*  No matter how much pain I've experienced, I cannot support violence as a path to justice. Iran is still my home. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6383.22s)]
*  Its people are still my home. I long for a future shape, not by war or retribution, but by dignity, freedom and peace for everyone. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6387.22s)]
*  Like, I think the other side of this is like, Iran is an incredibly proud nation. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6394.22s)]
*  Bro, bro, in some ways, Iran literally is everything that Israel larps as an actual continuous 2000-year empire and culture and nation-state. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6403.22s)]
*  Like, Israel is 77 years old. It's totally made up. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6415.22s)]
*  Iran has 3000 years of history. What are we talking about? [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6420.22s)]
*  It's a very proud people too. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6426.22s)]
*  I mean, 4000, whatever, however long you want to say it is. I don't know. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6430.22s)]
*  So is the strong sense of anger commonly shared among different citizens with different mindsets, with different mentalities? [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6434.22s)]
*  Either they are 100% or- [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6444.22s)]
*  So you're okay with Iran making news and no one doing anything about it? [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6448.22s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes, yes. What is this question? [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6451.22s)]
*  Yeah, if Iran have nukes, they wouldn't be getting bombed right now. And they wouldn't be bombing Israel. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6456.22s)]
*  Really? Yeah, really, bro. Really, really. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6461.22s)]
*  Nuclear doctrine. Ukraine should have never given up the nukes. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6465.22s)]
*  Okay, you give up the nukes, you don't have sovereignty. That is what it is. I want the nuclearization across the board. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6471.22s)]
*  But without nukes, look at what's going on in your country, you know? [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6477.22s)]
*  Okay, give nukes to Poland? Sure, go ahead. Give them to Poland. Great. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6480.22s)]
*  Probably play a role in stopping the Russian invasion. R slash Marxist culture, nine months ago. Hassan Abiy doctrine. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6485.22s)]
*  A guy for a nation building. Get one. Nukes. Rule number one. Get nukes. Rule number two. Do not give up your nukes. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6492.22s)]
*  Rule number three. If you're accused of having nukes, drop everything immediately and find some nukes. What does rule number three imply? [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6498.22s)]
*  What is going on in Iran right now? [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6505.22s)]
*  Countries that were accused of having nukes and then successfully dropped everything and found nukes. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6507.22s)]
*  Iran nukes. North Korea. Country that is not currently lit on fire. North Korea. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6512.22s)]
*  Countries that were accused of having nukes that dropped everything and did not find some nukes. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6517.22s)]
*  What is happening in Libya? Open slave markets. Open air slave markets. That's it. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6521.22s)]
*  Rule number three is the current rule number. Another one. WMDs. Iraq. No WMDs. You didn't have WMDs. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6526.22s)]
*  America claimed you had it. Look where you're at now. For the past three decades, Iran has played ball with the International Atomic Council [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6536.22s)]
*  and has tried to cooperate and has only been over as a direct consequence of trying to cooperate with America and by way of America, Israel. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6544.22s)]
*  And what has it gotten in return? Nothing. Death. Destruction. Economic starvation. Instability. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6555.22s)]
*  Why the **** shouldn't they have nukes, man? What are we talking about? Of course, they should have gotten nukes years ago. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6562.22s)]
*  John Merzheimer believes, and I agree with him on this, that if Iran had nukes, the region would be more stable and I unironically believe him. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6570.22s)]
*  I agree with him. I don't agree with him on everything, but on this one, I do agree with him. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6578.22s)]
*  Dramatic attack in the Iranian capital. Our planes attacked a total of four targets. The Ministry of Defense, the nuclear headquarters, nuclear laboratories, and oil facilities. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6582.22s)]
*  Peace to our planes. Yeah, think about it this way. Look at India and Pakistan. Why didn't they actually go to full-throated battle? [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6589.22s)]
*  Why didn't they go through the full-blown battle? [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6597.22s)]
*  Wynand reports that one person has been killed in a new Iranian missile strike on Tamra, a town near Haifa in northern Israel. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6600.22s)]
*  No religious state should have nukes, but I guess America is its own religion, not gonna lie. What do you mean no religious state should have nukes? [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6606.22s)]
*  Israel has nukes. Israel has the highest nuke density per capita from every other country on the planet. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6612.22s)]
*  Israel has more nukes per population than any other country on the planet. And yes, you're right. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6620.22s)]
*  America is also a religious country and they still have their own version of nukes. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6625.22s)]
*  By this estimation, the only country that should have nukes is the USSR and China. And yes, I agree. So there you go. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6631.22s)]
*  I guess technically India as well, but not Pakistan. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6640.22s)]
*  Literally what countries that are nuclear superpowers are are that's wrong. The Vatican has three nukes. Yeah, North Korea. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6645.22s)]
*  North Korea. Democratic People's Republic of Korea should have nukes, not religious. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6654.22s)]
*  Okay. CCP not religious. China should have nukes. I guess India is technically secular. That's the claim. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6660.22s)]
*  So I guess they get to have one. France also, even though India has gone super Hindu nationalism. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6670.22s)]
*  So I don't know. I don't know how secular they are still. America is not a secular nation. Okay. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6677.22s)]
*  Miss me with that bullshit. America's religion is the most damaging one. It's capitalism. America has a ass. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6682.22s)]

*  Oh, what the? Oh, minor blip, minor blip, minor mini f, mini f, mini f. Classic. We got to have some mini f's. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6708.22s)]

*  This was the longest like extended minor f sequence of all time. All right. We are going to have to see how bad the delay is. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6741.22s)]
*  And then I'm going to have to probably fix the ingest. All right, everybody. In order to figure out how bad the delay is, press one now. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6750.22s)]
*  One, two, three, four, five, six. Okay. Six second delay. It's not that bad. Like maybe seven for some like eight to ten for others. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6758.22s)]
*  Okay. Big, big. Okay. For. Okay. That delay is pretty significant. All right. We're going to test the delay. The only other way to know if you're on. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6771.22s)]

*  No, that's an 11 second to 15 second delay. All right. This means I'm going to have to hit a quick mini F to fix the ingest. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6808.22s)]
*  By the time you hear me, the F will come one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. And we're back. It blipped at 11. Jake Tapper never does this. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6818.22s)]

*  To collapse the whole establishment. And today we sing a new energy infrastructure. So where does it end? [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6855.22s)]
*  Well, hitting them and adding to the effort to collapse the state. I mean, whenever state doesn't have energy, the state is infrastructure is hit. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6862.22s)]
*  Whenever there is war, you're turning the state into a failed state. But the issue is that with the Iranians, I mean, regardless of the own proportional attacks, because there's really they have the. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6875.22s)]
*  Well, I was brought up on subway days. So what's your take? Every country. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6891.22s)]
*  So what's your take? Every country should have one nuclear bomb. 100% disagree. I think that's an awful idea. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6900.22s)]
*  They should have zero. Oh, well, that's good, too. I would like I would obviously prefer that. But if they're going to have any, it should just be one. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6906.22s)]
*  You're not saying you're pro nuclear bomb. You're saying you just want to limit the amount that are available. If every country has one. Okay. We know you have one. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6914.22s)]
*  So if you use it, then you're like, we don't we were defenseless. We got no bombs. Everyone knows it. And also you're kind of. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6922.22s)]
*  I have a jerk. I don't know. I think that having any nuclear bombs is a bad idea. Oh, totally. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6930.22s)]
*  There's 12,469 out there right now. I mean, the last three digits up and there's only 195 countries. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6936.22s)]
*  So I'm here coming on your show to say, let's take out 11,800 of those bombs. Okay, I get what you're saying. You're saying right now there are too many. Oh, there's way too many. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6944.22s)]
*  And you don't want to go to zero because that's not realistic. Yeah. Like, you know, people don't take away my guns. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6955.22s)]
*  Everyone has one gun. Actually, that'd be a bad example. Don't print that. Do you think that if everyone had one bomb, the world would be a safer place? Absolutely. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6962.22s)]
*  There wouldn't be any bullies in the world. Right. But you disagree with me, Kareem. Don't tell me you disagree with me. I like evening the playing field. I think that's a nice. Thank you. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6971.22s)]
*  Are you 100% agree? But I think that there should be none. I do too. I agree with you. No, you think that every country should have one. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6979.22s)]
*  I think every country should have none. Well, yeah, but that's not going to get the Internet talking, is it? Hey, I think there should be peace. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6988.22s)]
*  Everyone's like, yeah, you idiot. Of course. But come on. Just one bomb is all I'm concerned. Is that bad? Am I going to get in trouble? [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=6993.22s)]
*  Could have started the whole series with this take and you would have gotten viral right away. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=7002.22s)]
*  But. Sorry, actually. Yeah, I'll get off next, I think. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=7009.22s)]
*  I agree. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=7020.22s)]
*  I agree. At least be very alarming. That's notable considering early on Friday morning, the US president sending very. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhBTdC143jA&t=7026.22s)]
