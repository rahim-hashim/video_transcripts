*  the broadcast last night and the broadcast last night. And what did I do? Pretty much [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE8TR1DYWQ&t=102.0s)]
*  nothing. Just hung out with Kaya our last night together. And other than that, watched [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE8TR1DYWQ&t=108.8s)]
*  Mashal set up my steam deck, set up my, set up my, my Netflix and HBO accounts to make [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE8TR1DYWQ&t=116.68s)]

*  Nosferatu. No, I'm good. Thank you. But yeah, that's personal news wise. That's all I did. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE8TR1DYWQ&t=162.32s)]
*  I went to bed and I've just been, I've been on a, I've been on a drinking a lot of water [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE8TR1DYWQ&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  before I go to sleep. Arc. Okay. I've been a hydrated girly and I keep waking up at like [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE8TR1DYWQ&t=176.28s)]
*  443 every night to piss. Okay. Like 443. And when I wake up, I'm so sweaty. It's crazy. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE8TR1DYWQ&t=183.16000000000003s)]
*  And the house is so damn cold. It is just, I don't know. It makes it hard for me to go back to sleep, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE8TR1DYWQ&t=195.48000000000002s)]
*  but you know, that's neither here nor there. Basically did that worked out workout videos [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE8TR1DYWQ&t=201.0s)]
*  are back. Okay. I'm going to try to also stay on my workout arc. I'm going to try to stay on my workout [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE8TR1DYWQ&t=207.64000000000001s)]
*  grind when I'm out in Japan as well. This is from yesterday is from yesterday. The boy shooting, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE8TR1DYWQ&t=214.6s)]
*  shooting buckets. This is Kaya before, before she goes to school, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE8TR1DYWQ&t=223.16s)]
*  getting her workout in. I will most likely release the J the, the Japan schedule later as well. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE8TR1DYWQ&t=230.12s)]
*  But for the time being, for the time being, this is all I got. Do you have any hot takes [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE8TR1DYWQ&t=239.4s)]
*  for trash tastes? Your lovey take is their top 10 most viewed clips of all time. Yeah. I don't know. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE8TR1DYWQ&t=244.68s)]
*  I kind of, I kind of blew up. I kind of blew up that whole Luffy is a, is a playlist. Luffy is a [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE8TR1DYWQ&t=250.36s)]
*  terrorist stuff. So I got to come back hot with some, I'm probably peak though. But we'll figure [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE8TR1DYWQ&t=258.44s)]
*  it out. We'll figure it out. We'll figure it out. Any wrestling in the schedule? Yes. Here's the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE8TR1DYWQ&t=267.64s)]
*  link for later. Bernie has in the budget director of healthcare is a human right from today. Yeah. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE8TR1DYWQ&t=272.2s)]
*  We're just in there. Don't worry. We'll do it. Will Japan, you are be EST friendly per chance. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE8TR1DYWQ&t=275.8s)]
*  So my goal in Japan, I'll just briefly bring this up. My goal in Japan is to hopefully, hopefully [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE8TR1DYWQ&t=281.47999999999996s)]
*  stream like approximately at like, nor right now I started 11 a.m., 11 a.m. Pacific. Now, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE8TR1DYWQ&t=291.15999999999997s)]
*  11 a.m. Pacific, unfortunately is what let's look at the, let's look at the time in Tokyo right now. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE8TR1DYWQ&t=300.76s)]
*  Look at the Tokyo time right now. Okay. Tokyo time right now is 4 a.m. So 4 a.m. is a little [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE8TR1DYWQ&t=305.56s)]
*  too rich for my blood. It might be a little too early for me. Okay. So I'm probably going to start [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE8TR1DYWQ&t=312.59999999999997s)]
*  at 5 a.m. Okay. Which means I'm probably going to start at 12 p.m. Pacific time, which means going [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE8TR1DYWQ&t=318.67999999999995s)]
*  to be at 3 p.m. EST. Okay. That's the problem. I'm going to be, I'm still going to, it's my problem, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE8TR1DYWQ&t=327.64s)]
*  but don't worry. I won't make it your problem. And for the people who are saying you're crazy, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE8TR1DYWQ&t=334.92s)]
*  you're nuts. I did this. I literally did this last time. Hello. I straight up did this last time. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE8TR1DYWQ&t=339.64000000000004s)]
*  That's like exactly what I did. So I'm going to do three to four hours of regular desktop commentary [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE8TR1DYWQ&t=347.96000000000004s)]
*  content as I usually do when I'm out there. Okay. And then afterwards, we're going to do an IRL [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE8TR1DYWQ&t=356.76s)]
*  You did it twice. Actually. Yeah, I've done it twice. I've been in Japan twice. Both times. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE8TR1DYWQ&t=364.92s)]
*  I planted my ass. I sat my white ass down and I listened and I streamed. Okay. And last time I did [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE8TR1DYWQ&t=369.88s)]
*  that, there was a lot of drama happening in America. And I suspect this time when I'm in Japan, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE8TR1DYWQ&t=377.72s)]
*  there will probably also once again be a lot of drama happening in America. And I suspect that [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE8TR1DYWQ&t=383.64s)]
*  nothing will change in terms of my like regular stream, regular broadcasting, all that stuff, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE8TR1DYWQ&t=390.04s)]
*  like I'll probably, you know, do my very best to, you know, continue doing my regular streams. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE8TR1DYWQ&t=394.6s)]
*  As I would have done if I was sitting here in Los Angeles, sunny Los Angeles, California, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE8TR1DYWQ&t=403.16s)]
*  the only difference being that my vibes will be immaculate significantly better, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE8TR1DYWQ&t=407.72s)]
*  significantly better than if they would be when I was, if I was stuck in LA. Now, the only reason [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE8TR1DYWQ&t=414.20000000000005s)]
*  for that is because as many of you know, when I'm in Japan, I'm in a much better mood. Were you in [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE8TR1DYWQ&t=421.88s)]
*  Japan when Queen Elizabeth died or somewhere else? I was a shit camp when Queen Elizabeth died, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE8TR1DYWQ&t=427.4s)]
*  new wildfire in LA above LA just broke out. I won't, that's not going to be my problem. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE8TR1DYWQ&t=432.92s)]
*  You know what I mean? I'm going to be out of here. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE8TR1DYWQ&t=438.36s)]
