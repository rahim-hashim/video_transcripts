*  Now in conversations with Israeli sources they are drawing a stark contrast and what is happening here? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=159.48s)]
*  The Israelis are going after military and nuclear sites the Iranians are firing ballistic missiles toward Israeli civilians [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=164.88s)]
*  Brett tray X in Tel Aviv tray. Thank you joining us now Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=172.24s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister welcome back to special report [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=178.24s)]
*  Goddamn, he's ugly as thank you good to be with you, but first of all let me start at the beach [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=181.76s)]
*  Before we get to this I want to show you this tray inks coverage an unprecedented moment [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=187.44s)]
*  He says it's a moment for Israel again. We have been reporting here on the ground for nearly seven years [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=191.24s)]
*  We have seen rocket attacks from Hamas and Islamic jihad in Gaza [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=196.32s)]
*  Precision guided missiles coming from Hezbollah in southern Lebanon ballistic missiles from the Houthis in Yemen Iran backed Iraqi in Syria and Shia militias [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=199.52s)]
*  Launching drones and missiles at this country what we are seeing today [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=207.48000000000002s)]
*  Israel has never faced and Israeli officials tell us they are fighting for their survival [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=210.84s)]
*  Tray, Tray you mentioned that there's an emphasis on taking out the energy infrastructure [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=216.0s)]
*  You mentioned many of the sites that they hit this warning [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=223.12s)]
*  I read that there was an oil field that was hit but that oil field is co-owned by Iran and Qatar [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=226.44s)]
*  What kind of worries are there or anything you can see as far as the possibility that this now could expand? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=232.56s)]
*  This is a really great question and I also have some reporting on this and I just want to think through our source on this [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=241.64s)]
*  This was someone an official familiar with this oil field and this gas field [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=247.64s)]
*  You raise an important point. This is a shared gas field [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=253.64s)]
*  It's the largest field in the world and on the Iranian side it starts near to the city of Bandar Abbas in the south [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=256.64s)]
*  But it goes over and the Qataris and the Americans are invested in the other side [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=261.64s)]
*  of the gas field and I spoke with a source who described the Israeli strike against that as a dangerous escalation [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=270.64s)]
*  Because there is concern that if ultimately that gas field is targeted and the Iranians start to respond in the region [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=276.64s)]
*  That American interests and assets could be hit or affected and it could lead to an increase in energy prices [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=281.64s)]
*  It could lead to American forces or embassies in the region coming under attack [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=287.64s)]
*  And so there are certainly officials in this part of the world that are concerned about the location of these strikes [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=291.64s)]
*  The bottom line here is that the Israelis understand the next step up on the escalation ladder for them [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=297.64s)]
*  Is going after the energy infrastructure in Iran [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=304.64s)]
*  The very infrastructure that the regime uses to fund their ballistic missile program [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=307.64s)]
*  Bro, look at the framing. Look at the fucking framing. Sorry. Even American and Qatari interests need to take a hit here [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=311.64s)]
*  And potentially with Iranian retaliation, the rest of the world has to take a hit here because sorry America and Israel have great ambitions [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=322.64s)]
*  Of bring everyone they can in Tehran. This is why I say fascism is a death cult. It's a suicidal pact. And it's basically a double suicide [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=333.64s)]
*  Where the Western world is going to eat it too [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=344.64s)]
*  Because we have to let Israel keep doing whatever the fuck it wants and America does not recalculate and maybe demand restraint from Israel [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=348.64s)]
*  Open presence. Thank you for the 50-bit one [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=356.64s)]
*  They then used to fire at Israeli cities like the one that we're in in central Israel and hit buildings like the one behind me [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=358.64s)]
*  And so it's all connected and the region is watching very closely to see what comes next [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=364.64s)]
*  The question here is will there be a point that the Iranians throw in the towel and say look, they're not going to win [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=368.64s)]
*  Because the Israelis have that American support and if it continues to be this bad, the Israelis are going to continue looking to the United States for help [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=374.64s)]
*  We don't know what comes next. All we know is that according to Israeli officials, this country is bracing for days of intense ballistic missile barrages [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=382.64s)]
*  We have seen six barrages so far, more than 200 missiles streaming through the skies of this country [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=389.64s)]
*  Last night as they were targeting the northern city of Haifa, we stood on a balcony and we could see as they were slipping past missile defense systems [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=395.64s)]
*  Others being intercepted in the skies above and then just about 30 minutes later another barrage targeting the center part of Israel [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=402.64s)]
*  One of those missiles slipping past the arrow defense system and the Patriot system that is also deployed in this country and slamming into this building [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=409.64s)]
*  Killing at least one child. Civilians that were here asleep in their beds, some of them rushed to shelters, others couldn't make it in time [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=417.64s)]
*  And the aftermath guys, you see is behind me as these crews are picking up brick by brick, debris by debris, concrete block by concrete block [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=425.64s)]
*  Hoping for a miracle here in the center part of Israel, understanding that there still could be survivors [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=434.64s)]
*  The father of that man, Ofech, that we talked to earlier, still trapped under the rubble and they are hoping for a miracle [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=441.64s)]
*  Guys, back to you [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=449.64s)]
*  It's beginning. Why? So like Gaza every day, yes, but also even Tehran, even Tehran, because the Iranians on the Iranian side are also significantly larger than on the Israeli side [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=450.64s)]
*  Even if you were to, even if you were like, oh, well, you know, this is a separate incident, like we can't involve Israel's suicidal ambition in Gaza on this, which by the way, you should [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=463.64s)]
*  I don't think you can remove that from the calculation, but even if you were to look at simply Israel versus Iran [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=476.64s)]
*  Why did you launch this operation now? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=482.64s)]
*  Because we were facing an imminent threat, a dual existential threat. One, the threat of Iran rushing to weaponize their enriched uranium to make atomic [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=486.64s)]
*  The specific and declared intent to destroy us. Second, a rush to increase their ballistic missile arsenal into the capacity that they would have 3600 weapons a year, new weapons within three years [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=499.64s)]
*  10,000 ballistic missiles, each one weighing a ton, coming in at Mach 6 right into our cities, as you saw today. And then in 26 years, 20,000 [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=512.64s)]
*  That's no country can sustain that and certainly not a country the size of Israel. So we had to act. It was the 12th hour. We did act to save ourselves, but also I think to not only protect ourselves, but protect the world from this incendiary regime [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=523.64s)]
*  We can't have the world's most dangerous regime have the world's most dangerous weapons. We're protecting ourselves, but by doing so we're protecting many others [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=538.64s)]
*  I just want to press you on the Intel on the nuclear part. Less than two months ago, the new director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, testified on Capitol Hill saying that everything had been suspended since 2003 and had not restarted [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=546.64s)]
*  That the nuclear program had not been restarted by the Iranians. So did something change from end of March until this week? Was the US Intel wrong? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=560.64s)]
*  The Intel we got and we shared with the United States was absolutely clear. It was absolutely clear that they were working in a secret plan to weaponize the uranium. They were marching very quickly. They would achieve a test device and possibly an initial device within months and certainly less than a year. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=570.64s)]
*  That was the Intel we shared with the United States. I think we have excellent Intel in Iran. I think we've proven that and that is something that we couldn't possibly accept. Whether it would be six months or 12 months or 13 months is immaterial. Once they go that route, it's too late. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=591.64s)]
*  And we will not have a second Holocaust. We already had one in the previous century. The Jewish state is not going to have the Holocaust made it on the Jewish people. It's not going to happen. Never again is now and we have to act now. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=608.64s)]
*  What is the goal of these strikes? You talked early in one of yours. The attacks began with a message directly to the Iranian people. Clearly some of these strikes have targeted Iranian leadership, military, nuclear scientists and other leaders. So is regime change part of the effort here? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=622.64s)]
*  Could certainly be the result because the Iran regime is very weak. I think it's basically left with two things. It's plans to have atomic bombs and ballistic missiles. That's basically what Iran has. They certainly don't have the people. 80% of the people will throw these theological thugs out. I mean they murder them, they oppress them for 46 years. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=642.64s)]
*  We must defend the Jewish state. We can't allow a fundamentalist Muslim state in the region operating in the ways that it does. It's like bro, okay. What about Israel you asshole? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=662.64s)]
*  Oh, I forgot. Sorry. I forget when, when, when we're talking about the Jewish state, all of a sudden it's not considered religious. It's like totally separate. Here's the urine for freedom. I mean, they shoot women. Theological thugs is a great way to describe Israel. Honestly, because they, their hair is uncovered. They shoot students. They, they just suck the oxygen from the, this brave and gifted, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=681.64s)]
*  The, The Iranian people and, you know, the Persian people and the Jewish people have had an ancient friendship goes back to the times of Cyrus, the gray that could happen again. But again, the decision to act, to rise up at this time is the decision of the Iranian people. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=711.64s)]
*  We decided to act because the Iranians are watching Fox news with Brett Bayer. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=727.06s)]
*  It would take Iran about 12 months to enrich enough nuclear material for a single nuclear weapons, United States Secretary of state, Anthony Blinken is warning that Iran is potentially just mother nature. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=733.28s)]
*  United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken is warning that Iran is potentially just months [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=738.46s)]
*  away or less from nuclear breakpoint. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=741.7800000000001s)]
*  Iran is two months away from a nuclear weapon and it's a victory to get them one year away? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=743.98s)]
*  Iran could be less than a month away from building a nuclear weapon. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=748.38s)]
*  Netanyahu has made two tough-talking TV appearances saying that Iran is just months away from [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=751.5400000000001s)]
*  making a nuclear bomb. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=756.36s)]
*  What is important- [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=757.36s)]
*  He's just crazy. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=758.36s)]
*  He's so wrong. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=759.36s)]
*  That's wild. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=760.36s)]
*  What you have to understand is that you have to dismantle the entire terror empire and [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=761.36s)]
*  its main practitioners, the terror states of Iran and Iraq, acquire nuclear weapons. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=765.94s)]
*  The terror states of Iran and Iraq, two countries that literally have nothing to do with 9-11. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=771.94s)]
*  Iran is especially crazy to say because for its entire war on terror history, America [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=781.2600000000001s)]

*  that America itself initially backed. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=800.68s)]
*  ISIS, Al-Qaeda. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=804.3199999999999s)]
*  These are inventions of Western empire that ran rampant throughout the entire region that [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=807.92s)]
*  America uses just cause to just like attack whoever they want to. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=815.8s)]
*  And Iran has always fought against them. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=820.24s)]
*  He's not wrong. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=834.84s)]
*  He's not doing this for news. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=835.84s)]
*  He's doing this for regime change with the help of the collective West. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=836.84s)]
*  This is normal US foreign policy, but with extra violence. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=838.5600000000001s)]
*  No, I know that. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=840.6s)]
*  I understand that. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=841.6s)]
*  I'm saying it's pathetic. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=842.6s)]
*  And this, I think has been a wake-up call from hell. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=843.6s)]
*  It is telling us. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=849.0s)]
*  Anyway, there's this also a dunk on someone who I think is like usually fine. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=850.76s)]
*  Yalda Hakim is probably one of the better anchors in Western press, but she got absolutely [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=860.12s)]
*  slapped around in this interview. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=869.32s)]
*  Thank you very much for joining us here on the program. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=873.2s)]
*  Did Iran majorly miscalculate? [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=875.64s)]
*  Because even now, President Trump is providing Iran with an off ramp, telling them to come [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=877.88s)]
*  to the negotiating table. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=881.9399999999999s)]
*  At what point will Iran take that offer? [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=883.1199999999999s)]
*  Well, according to your narrative, Iran always miscalculates. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=885.92s)]
*  It's a regime. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=890.1999999999999s)]
*  I heard the regime 20 times in the last 10 minutes as I was listening. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=891.1999999999999s)]
*  You sound like past news agency upgraded during the Soviet Union. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=894.4799999999999s)]
*  And you say the regime is unpopular and is killing its people. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=898.76s)]
*  When General Soleimani was murdered by the same Trump that you talk about, millions of [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=902.04s)]
*  people came to the streets of this city, Tehran, that I'm in. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=905.24s)]
*  So how is it that he's so unpopular? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=908.0s)]
*  This propaganda that you're producing is only justifying aggression. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=910.88s)]
*  What the Israeli regime did was aggression. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=914.8s)]
*  What it did was unjustified aggression. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=916.5600000000001s)]
*  And Netanyahu has been saying for over 30 years, some say up to 40 years, he's been [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=918.4s)]
*  saying that Iran's on the verge of creating a nuclear weapon. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=921.64s)]
*  And thanks to people like you, he gets away with these lies. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=924.24s)]
*  But people can go online and check how many times he's done these lies. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=927.0s)]
*  Professor Miranda, if you could just focus on—I know your narrative and I know the [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=929.6s)]
*  line you take. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=933.52s)]
*  I've heard it a number of times and I'm sure, but if you could just focus on answering the [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=934.6s)]
*  question in terms of the nuclear talks on day 60, you know, as far as we know, Donald [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=937.68s)]
*  Trump had said Iran has 60 days. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=942.96s)]
*  Israel attacked on the 61st day. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=945.24s)]
*  Can we talk a little bit about the regime's competence levels, the intelligence and security? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=947.28s)]
*  Well, it is unpopular. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=952.04s)]
*  Dude, it doesn't fucking matter. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=953.28s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=956.88s)]
*  Are you, are you having a conversation about domestic policy inside of Iran? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=959.34s)]
*  Are you not happy with the way that they're picking up trash? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=964.5999999999999s)]
*  Are you not happy with their lack of freedom, like lack of free speech or some shit? [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=968.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=973.4399999999999s)]
*  You can save that for a totally separate conversation. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=974.4399999999999s)]
*  You can't use that within the backdrop of Israel's unjustifiable bombing campaign in [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=977.18s)]
*  Tehran because if you do that, you're ridiculous. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=981.8s)]
*  Notice how nobody says that when talking about the Iranian retaliatory strikes. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=987.9s)]
*  No one goes, the incredibly unpopular Israeli regime is getting bombed. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=991.92s)]
*  Nobody says that. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=997.76s)]
*  No one said that after nine 11, the incredibly unpopular American regime after decades of [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=998.76s)]
*  instability in the region is finally experiencing the concept of blowback. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1004.14s)]
*  Like, can you imagine Western press like BBC calling up like American officials to be like, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1008.16s)]
*  Why is your, why is your administrative structure so incredibly unpopular? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1019.06s)]
*  Perhaps it has something to do with the endless amount of destabilization that it caused in [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1022.8199999999999s)]
*  the region. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1025.94s)]
*  Like post nine 11. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1030.08s)]
*  I don't say that about Israel either. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1036.46s)]
*  I'm not saying like Israel's regime is unpopular amongst the population. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1038.22s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1041.74s)]
*  The reason why this is happening is not because Israel is unpopular amongst his own citizens [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1043.86s)]
*  and Iran is looking for a regime change in Israel. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1049.54s)]
*  Western press consistently does say Danielle was unpopular. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1056.5s)]
*  Yeah, but they don't use that as a reason for why Iran is bombing Israel. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1059.1s)]
*  That's my point. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1065.1399999999999s)]
*  Do not understand. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1069.06s)]
*  This conversation is about is look at the Chiron Israel Iran attacks. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1071.18s)]
*  Do Iranians dare revolt? [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1076.68s)]
*  Iranians when they're being bombed by Israel with American weapons are still getting called [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1082.74s)]
*  into question their own loyalties to the government. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1087.8s)]
*  Like what a ridiculous statement and it only serves one purpose, which is manufacturing [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1092.18s)]
*  Israel's actions in Iran. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1097.86s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1106.2199999999998s)]
*  Like only in jokes do we talk about, do we talk about like, gee, send Xi Jinping, send [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1122.3s)]
*  the Dongfang missiles. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1128.5s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1129.5s)]
*  I don't mean that sincerely. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1130.5s)]
*  When I look to this awful administration, you know, I don't want to, I don't want to [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1132.82s)]
*  die at least for that reason. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1138.1s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1140.34s)]
*  The average liberal cast against the invasion of Iraq getting due by the exact same rhetoric [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1141.58s)]
*  22 years later, without even a shred of critical thinking, Iran is WMDs will never not be [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1145.58s)]
*  funny. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1149.74s)]
*  Iran is WMDs. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1151.14s)]
*  Iran is unpopular. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1152.82s)]
*  They will welcome us as liberators. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1153.9s)]
*  It's the exact same method. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1156.06s)]
*  And if liberals, I mean, here's the problem. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1158.1s)]
*  A lot of people are that stupid. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1162.94s)]
*  A lot of people are dumb enough to be like, yeah, especially well-read libs. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1168.1s)]
*  Well, well, red libs that need a just cause for pushing a regime change through military [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1171.66s)]
*  acts. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1184.8200000000002s)]
*  This is perfect for them. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1185.8200000000002s)]
*  This is a perfect narrative for them. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1187.0600000000002s)]
*  They hear this and they're like, this is great. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1188.3400000000001s)]
*  She has a valid question. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1190.8200000000002s)]
*  How could Iran not expect an attack on day 61 when Trump was evacuating U.S. troops and [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1191.8200000000002s)]
*  diplomats? [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1195.8600000000001s)]
*  Iran was made to look rather stupid. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1196.8600000000001s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1198.18s)]
*  That doesn't showcase the Iranian stupidity as much as it showcases the depravity of the [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1199.26s)]
*  West. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1206.8200000000002s)]
*  Having a fake negotiation about denuclearization with no real goals other than to create a [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1209.26s)]
*  sense of create a sense of stability so that Israel could directly strike Tehran. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1216.46s)]
*  And that wasn't even the question anyway. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1223.3400000000001s)]
*  Is Iran negotiating with Israel? [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1226.98s)]
*  No, Iran is negotiating with Israel's daddy, the United States of America. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1228.18s)]
*  Yeah, Bush had just stolen the election. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1233.46s)]
*  9-11 could have been the start of a revolution against him. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1236.26s)]
*  At what point do we go? [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1240.98s)]
*  What is this conversation that's taking place? [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1242.3400000000001s)]
*  I like her. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1245.5s)]

*  I think as far as like Western press goes, as far as Western media goes, I think she [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1249.54s)]
*  is definitely infinitely more critical of Israel than many other commentators are in [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1254.78s)]
*  this space. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1260.1399999999999s)]
*  But as time without an Owo said, this is a reset not only for Israeli society, but this [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1261.34s)]
*  kind of military incursion is a reset for the media in the West as well, where they [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1268.5s)]

*  The difference, of course, is that. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1289.26s)]
*  The public doesn't reset the public still clearly looks at the situation. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1292.98s)]
*  The public. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1300.46s)]

*  was able to build drone sites in your country, the fact that the leadership was asleep in [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1417.82s)]

*  Can we talk a little bit about the fact that the regime was taken completely by surprise [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1425.3s)]
*  and top leaders have now been decapitated and killed as a result of the Israeli attack? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1428.98s)]
*  Saying regime, regime, regime, I think it helps you contain your contempt for independent [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1436.3s)]
*  countries. After all, you work for Sky News. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1442.06s)]
*  It's understandable. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1445.46s)]
*  But the regime, how do you know that the Israeli regime had bases inside Iran? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1447.26s)]
*  You're just repeating their propaganda. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1453.46s)]
*  Of course, Israel for you is not a regime. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1454.8600000000001s)]
*  Sorry, it's a state. But Israel did have a drone building factory inside of Iran. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1456.22s)]
*  That's not fake. That is real. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1461.42s)]
*  It's a genocidal state carrying out. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1462.66s)]
*  And the reality of the matter is the reality of the matter is a big part of that is because [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1463.9s)]
*  of the crippling economic sanctions and the desperation of the public feels and the [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1467.82s)]
*  instability that causes partnered with the fundamentalist Ayatollah and the policies [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1471.54s)]
*  that they've implemented. You know, what's really interesting about this? [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1478.9s)]
*  I was reading a report on this a couple of weeks ago, like before all of this shit unfolded, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1481.58s)]
*  where with the more like reformist president, the Iranian government was moving in the [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1488.06s)]
*  direction of like not suppressing people for not suppressing women in highly populated [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1494.34s)]
*  areas, densely populated cities for not wearing a head job and stuff like that. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1500.74s)]
*  Like there was a little bit of a change in attitude and and they were moving in the [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1506.6200000000001s)]
*  direction of like a little bit of reform. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1511.46s)]
*  Now, that could potentially be short lived. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1513.18s)]
*  Right. But it's interesting to see that like. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1516.98s)]
*  It's interesting to see because even they are not oblivious to how much these [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1521.1s)]
*  restrictions cause enmity amongst the population. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1526.86s)]
*  Because at times of unprecedented, at times of unprecedented resistance. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1530.74s)]
*  At times of unprecedented resistance, it's almost always been the cultural flashpoint [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1543.26s)]
*  for the Iranian population is like a forcible hijab law being enforced by like some sort [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1549.58s)]
*  of morality police like that has always been a major, major point of contention, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1557.54s)]
*  understandably so. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1565.34s)]
*  Now, I'm living in Tehran, no one's forced to wear the hijab for almost Iran is full of [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1568.46s)]
*  girls without hijab. My sister went with a t-shirt and she was fine. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1571.98s)]
*  I don't know why Saddam Yahu was saying them. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1574.78s)]
*  No, no, I understand that. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1576.82s)]
*  My point is that came after the major resistance and like a lot of back and forth in [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1578.82s)]
*  Iran, though, no. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1583.8999999999999s)]
*  And they loosen the restriction. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1584.82s)]
*  What's that? Oh, shit. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1588.82s)]
*  New mount just dropped. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1592.7s)]
*  Nice. Do you think if the Ayatollah regime lifted all moral policing and hijab [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1593.7s)]
*  restriction, then things would be better for Iran or the West would accept Iran? [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1596.78s)]
*  No, absolutely not. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1599.3s)]
*  That's not my point at all. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1601.98s)]
*  I don't give a fuck about Western acceptance anyway. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1603.46s)]
*  No, I'm talking about this one purely on the basis of domestic policy from the [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1606.54s)]
*  perspective of the domestic population, the Iranian population. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1612.18s)]
*  And also, secondly, I'm talking about it even as a mechanism of like beefing up its [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1616.22s)]
*  national security, because clearly it's not even just the hijab restriction. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1622.1000000000001s)]
*  It's like all of this, all of these repressive attitudes, all it does is develop [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1627.5s)]
*  anger and resentment amongst the population. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1635.5800000000002s)]
*  And that creates an opportunity for foreign countries, especially when paired with the [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1638.98s)]
*  much more consequential economic sanctions strangling the population and causing [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1645.58s)]
*  instability. It creates opportunities of espionage like the one that I'm talking [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1651.42s)]
*  about with the drone factory. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1656.54s)]
*  Yeah, yes, we did. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1658.78s)]
*  Massa Amini movement. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1659.78s)]
*  We lost lots of young people to make this change in only Tehran. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1660.94s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1664.46s)]
*  It's not I wasn't talking about this from the from the perspective of the West. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1666.22s)]
*  The West will never the West doesn't give a shit about a secular country or not. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1669.6200000000001s)]
*  If the West cared about monarchs or Islamist fundamentalism, why aren't they [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1677.94s)]
*  doing this to Saudi Arabia? [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1682.6200000000001s)]
*  Why aren't they doing this to any of the Gulf states? [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1685.98s)]
*  Because it does not matter. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1688.6200000000001s)]
*  You can do whatever you want. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1691.3s)]
*  Western powers, Western powers have famously thwarted popular Democratic [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1693.0600000000002s)]
*  election results with military coups, violent military crews only to implement [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1700.5s)]
*  fascist dictatorship. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1706.5800000000002s)]
*  As long as that fascist dictatorship is a servile dog to Western interests and will [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1708.54s)]
*  play ball. This like this liberal calculation is completely idiotic. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1714.98s)]
*  The West didn't care about Iran when they didn't have forcible hijabs in 1954. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1719.86s)]
*  They hated Iran even then because they tried to nationalize the petroleum [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1723.42s)]
*  industry. Yeah. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1725.86s)]
*  They were moving in the direction of nationalization. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1727.98s)]
*  They didn't care about the Shah that they put into power when he was engaging in [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1732.02s)]
*  mass arrests and torturing people. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1737.02s)]
*  They didn't give a fuck about that. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1740.46s)]
*  It wasn't because the Iranian women can wear bikinis and the beaches or whatever [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1742.46s)]
*  you know, that is not a real calculation. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1747.7s)]
*  It's just marketing. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1750.54s)]
*  And the moment that you have the moment that you have the moment that you give [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1752.74s)]
*  air to that kind of sentiment, you're playing along with you're playing along [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1758.46s)]
*  with the marketing. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1763.1s)]
*  Extermination in Gaza, but that's not really important. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1765.1399999999999s)]

*  At apartment buildings and slaughter people in those apartment buildings, slaughtering [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1867.66s)]
*  whole families for you. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1871.78s)]
*  That's targeting. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1872.98s)]
*  That's that's a really sophisticated act. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1873.78s)]
*  But if I can just ask, have military facilities, have nuclear facilities been hit? [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1875.94s)]
*  One of the buildings that has some of these commanders, one or two of these commanders [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1884.38s)]
*  was a large apartment building where they killed everyone. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1888.74s)]
*  Sixty people, 20 children. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1891.26s)]
*  That's not important for people like you, but that's important for people like us. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1892.7s)]
*  Are you people like you who support ethnic supremacism and the chosen people being able [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1896.02s)]
*  to slaughter and exterminate? [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1900.66s)]
*  I'm just trying to get the perspective. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1901.86s)]
*  We're trying to give you air time so that you can give us the Iranian perspective on [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1904.66s)]
*  this. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1908.42s)]
*  Moran is from Virginia. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1909.06s)]
*  It don't matter, brother. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1910.18s)]
*  He is he is 10 toes down pro. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1911.3s)]
*  What do you mean he is pro Iran? [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1915.54s)]
*  And we want to know and I want to understand Iran. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1919.38s)]
*  Most of the dues that you have like this are not they're not going to defend the Iranian [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1922.02s)]
*  government position here. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1927.6200000000001s)]
*  Will you come to the negotiating table now? [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1929.3s)]
*  Donald Trump, after these series of airstrikes and this attack was launched, called on Iran [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1931.14s)]
*  to come back to the negotiating table as the spokesperson of the regime or someone who [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1935.54s)]
*  worked closely with the negotiating team. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1940.02s)]
*  Do you believe they will come to the negotiating table now? [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1941.86s)]
*  Well, your regime should know and your news agency or your TV channel should know better. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1944.26s)]
*  We were at the negotiating table. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1955.22s)]
*  It was Trump that conspired with Netanyahu to attack Iran. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1957.06s)]
*  This is how you invite me because you're easily exposed. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1961.62s)]
*  He Iran was negotiating. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1965.62s)]
*  Initially, Trump had one position and so did with cop. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1968.58s)]
*  And then they flipped and said no enrichment. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1972.1799999999998s)]
*  And then they continued the negotiations. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1974.74s)]
*  And the night before the attack, Trump said that we don't want war. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1976.5s)]
*  And then after the attack, he said, we're all for it. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1979.6999999999998s)]
*  And you're saying Iran? [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1982.1799999999998s)]
*  What is Iran going to come back to the negotiating table? [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1983.3799999999999s)]
*  The audacity. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1985.86s)]
*  Come on, be a bit show at least a bit of integrity. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1986.8999999999999s)]
*  By the way, Iran 100%. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1990.98s)]
*  100% would cease its hostilities literally overnight. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=1994.74s)]
*  And a moment's notice if Israel gave Israel and America gave real assurances. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2002.5800000000002s)]
*  Like there is not even a question in my mind. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2007.46s)]
*  There has not been a single moment. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2010.26s)]
*  There has not been a single moment where Iran has behaved like the irresponsible party. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2013.38s)]
*  Post October 7, not once. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2019.6200000000001s)]
*  And they have actually violated their own preset red law, red lines, I assume partially because [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2021.62s)]
*  the early reporting was correct that that Hamas and the Palestinian resistance [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2031.78s)]
*  did not inform Iran of October 7, but like they, there is a, there was an established red line [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2040.82s)]
*  that Israel violated Hezbollah, the Houthis, Iran were supposed to do all of this stuff that Iran is [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2047.22s)]
*  doing right now. If Israel were to go full tilt ethnic cleansing in the Gaza Strip, they didn't do [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2056.26s)]
*  it. That was supposed to be a established red line that they did not enforce when they did not [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2061.86s)]
*  enforce said the red line, or at least like Hezbollah did to a certain degree, but with a lot of [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2068.42s)]
*  restraint. They didn't do it. They didn't do it after October 7. They didn't do it after [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2075.22s)]
*  they didn't do it after Israel bombed the embassy compound in Damascus. They didn't do it after [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2081.14s)]
*  Israel blew up Ismail Hani in Tehran. They don't do it. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2087.9399999999996s)]
*  And it does feel like the reason why after these new revelations of how deeply penetrated Iran [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2093.22s)]
*  actually is in terms of like Mossad penetration and maybe even Western intelligence that perhaps [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2102.9s)]
*  might've been a calculation by Yaya Sinwar to not inform Hezbollah or Iran about October 7 [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2110.1800000000003s)]
*  beforehand. And it also works with the, I think it works along with the Israel did not believe [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2117.46s)]
*  that October 7 would be as deadly. Even if they thought that there was, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2128.5s)]
*  even if they thought that there was a lot of military training happening, like people say, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2134.7400000000002s)]
*  how could they have not foreseen this? Like how could they have not foreseen October 7? [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2138.9s)]
*  Maybe they had a higher priority intelligence asset deeply embedded both within the IRGC [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2144.02s)]
*  and in Hezbollah as well. And because Hezbollah and IRGC were not telling them this is going to [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2150.42s)]
*  happen, they just thought that it was not going to happen. Because even if they see military [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2156.5s)]
*  movement, military training, and then they're waiting on information from their sources within [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2161.7s)]
*  Iran and their sources within Lebanon inside of Hezbollah, and they don't actually hear anything [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2169.7s)]
*  from them. They're like, oh yeah, it's fine. You can move troops to the West bank. You know what I [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2175.94s)]
*  mean? Dude, this, this camera is not doing Benjamin and Yahoo any favors by the way. It's pretty [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2179.86s)]
*  crazy. Also here is this new Israel urge the Trump administration to join the war with Iran to [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2186.6600000000003s)]
*  eliminate its nuclear program. US official told me that they're currently administration is not [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2191.38s)]
*  considering a move. Aaron Monte says based on the pattern so far, this anonymous claim means that [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2194.82s)]
*  the administration is definitely considering such a move or has already told Israel. Yes, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2199.86s)]
*  just as the back and forth that they've had about assassinating top Iranian leadership. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2204.02s)]
*  Anyway, let's hear from this other monster. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2212.1s)]
*  Everybody knows that when the Israelis try to retard the Iranian nuclear weapon program, [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2214.5s)]
*  he's doing the world a huge service. So why doesn't the British government just come out [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2220.18s)]
*  and say what they believe and what everybody knows? Why don't they support what Israel? [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2226.5s)]
*  I like that everyone in opposition, like all the opposition parties, regardless of like whether [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2231.86s)]
*  they are Democrats, supposed to be the leftist opposition to the Republicans in America, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2237.54s)]
*  or they're the Tories, which is supposed to be the right wing opposition to the labor party, [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2243.38s)]
*  which is supposed to be the left country, the left governance. They all say they would be more in [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2248.58s)]
*  favor of Israel than the existing government. It's so funny. It's just like, it doesn't matter [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2255.78s)]
*  who's in fucking power. It doesn't matter who's in charge. They're full tilt in support of Israel [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2264.98s)]
*  and their opposition, regardless of whatever kind of like ideological brush they've painted themselves [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2270.6600000000003s)]
*  with is saying they would be even more in favor of Israel. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2275.5400000000004s)]
*  Has done I'll tell you why because it's all about managing the growing anti-Israeli feeling in the [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2280.58s)]
*  labor party, the growing anti-semitism, I'm afraid, in labor rank and file and it's nothing to do with [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2286.2599999999998s)]
*  the national interest. Everybody knows that when the Israelis try to retard the Iranian nuclear [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2292.9s)]
*  weapon program, he said the R word cancel him. He said the R word he's ableist. I guess he's, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2298.74s)]
*  it's his word. He can say it. You know what I mean? Also national dollar book. How are you [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2307.94s)]
*  Orrin Marmor Marmor Stein, Israel's minister, foreign affairs spokesperson also went on sky news [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2312.9s)]
*  and had this to say, how are you explaining to Israelis why they're needing to spend the night [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2320.7400000000002s)]
*  in bomb shelters? Why mothers are trying to comfort their children when the walls of their [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2327.46s)]
*  apartments are shaking? How are you explaining it to them? And how long are you telling them to prepare [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2331.78s)]
*  for it to continue? Perhaps the best way to explain how we're explaining. I'll show with you [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2337.78s)]
*  how I explain it to my nine-year-old daughter. Really wanted to blow up Iran. Tehran. Iran. Tehran. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2343.86s)]
*  He's Bala. Hamas. Tehran. These are regimes of terror. Yes. When we rushed her into the shelter, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2356.1s)]
*  I told her that in a very foul place called Iran, there is a very extreme regime, the Mullah regime, [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2369.14s)]
*  and they're doing everything possible to get their hands against around the most dangerous weapon [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2377.3s)]
*  humankind ever known, nuclear weapon. And that's why we are undergoing these difficulties, but it's [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2385.14s)]
*  in order for us to be safe. And actually it's not only for us, Israel, to be safe. The idea is to [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2391.4599999999996s)]
*  to make this place, the world, a safer place. How are you explaining to Israel? I lied to my daughter [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2398.18s)]
*  about how Israel is number one and we have to blow up Tehran. This is why we have to do it. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2406.1s)]
*  All right. Anyway, Sky News is Yalda Hakim is back. This time asking an Israeli military [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2419.54s)]
*  spokesperson about the dozen Iranian women and children the Israeli forces killed in recent days. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2424.58s)]
*  This is part of the reason why I, you know, I say she's like not the worst. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2428.8199999999997s)]
*  Something amazing I don't think anyone has believed we would do. Israel has gained [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2433.94s)]
*  freedom of operation in Iranian skies. We have been operating over two days in a row, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2440.34s)]
*  non-stop in Iranian skies. Our jets are flying over Tehran, locating those ballistic missiles, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2445.7000000000003s)]
*  gathering intelligence, intercepting them before they fire towards Israel. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2453.3s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel Shoshandi, you've also killed dozens of Iranian civilians. Israel claims and [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2456.82s)]
*  often talks about being different to the Iranian regime, but you've also left. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2463.54s)]
*  Very local accent. Yes, guys, again, you're failing to comprehend once again, due to your [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2469.46s)]
*  unlimited anti-Semitism, that this is a localized MENA accent. Okay. Yes, it sounds a lot like a dude [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2475.94s)]
*  that you will hang out with in, I don't know, New York City, Los Angeles, [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2486.42s)]
*  but, but actually it's, you don't get it. It's clearly, this is a local MENA accent. Okay. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2493.94s)]
*  Clearly. Can you please put subtitles on? I can't understand him through his accent. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2503.62s)]
*  Dozens and dozens of Iranian women and children dead in these operations. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2509.38s)]
*  Well, I think we are definitely different. I think, I think it's very simple to see how, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2513.38s)]
*  how far different we are. You know, Israel is carrying out precise operation over 1500 [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2517.3s)]

*  they love pointing to that photo. Like we haven't seen the other buildings that they took down [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2529.54s)]
*  entirely. And also what they have done in Gaza, like, Oh, you don't get it. You don't get it. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2533.94s)]
*  It's a very targeted strike. It's very targeted, very precise. Please celebrate us. It's like, [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2541.7s)]
*  dude, what are you talking about? Like, that's not the only thing we've seen, man. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2550.8199999999997s)]
*  It's firing ballistic missiles with one ton of explosives in the warhead. These ballistic [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2555.9399999999996s)]
*  missiles can explode an entire neighborhood and they're just firing them at the center of [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2563.14s)]
*  population. Israel is sending their, their jets. We're sending our people to be above enemy [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2567.62s)]
*  territory to try and do. I love this argument always, which is why, as you guys know, I'm team [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2573.06s)]
*  give Hamas an iron dome. I'm also team give the Al Qassam brigades and air force and an airport, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2580.8199999999997s)]
*  like a military airport so they can do more precise targeting. Same with Iran. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2590.66s)]
*  Let Iran fly through Syrian and Iraqi airspace and let Iran also have refueling capabilities [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2597.94s)]
*  above the Syrian and Iraqi airspace so they can do more precise, more targeted campaigns. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2606.9s)]
*  If that's how we're supposed to be doing it, like, okay, fair is fair. I'm sure they don't [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2614.9s)]
*  want to use up all of their missiles, right? Give the Iranian air force equal opportunity [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2620.26s)]
*  to do precise targeting law to brain cell take really. That's a two brain cell take, [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2629.1400000000003s)]
*  but it's, it's actually a maximum brain cell take when he literally says that he's like, [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2635.5400000000004s)]
*  Oh, well we are actually, we're actually sending our troops over there. We're actually sending [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2640.5800000000004s)]
*  our troops over there. It's like scary. We're sending the, the, the Israeli air force over [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2646.66s)]
*  there to do precise targeting. It's like, yeah, because you've packed up every other regional, [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2652.58s)]
*  every other regional power you get free rein if you want like, what's the argument Iran is imprecise [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2659.14s)]
*  in their targeting. Yeah, they are. They're lobbing missiles from thousands of miles away. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2666.2599999999998s)]
*  If you want them to be precise, let them fly over Iraq, let them fly over Syria, let them fly over [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2670.18s)]
*  Jordan, you know? Yeah. Get them, get them to, to be able to refuel their planes on the long mission [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2676.5s)]
*  as precise as we can. And we have been very precise so far. And we have even given warnings. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2684.9s)]
*  You know, the most important thing in the battlefield is to, is to have the element of [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2690.26s)]
*  surprise. We have given warning law to brace. I'll take less arm terrorists with F 35s. No, [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2693.46s)]
*  no, no, no, I wouldn't do that. No, it seems like the F 35 is, is maybe, maybe F 22s. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2698.9s)]
*  It seems like the F 22 is more resilient. The F 35 is pretty dangerous for the IRGC's air force. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2708.26s)]
*  I don't want the, I don't want the IRGC, the IRGC pilots to risk their lives by getting into [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2714.98s)]
*  a death trap. I guess F 22s, you can't bomb with them, right? I'm not a big plane autist. I don't [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2722.74s)]
*  know what kind of, what kind of munitions you can put on F 22s, but I'm sure they could still be [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2728.9s)]
*  more precise. Like we don't already give F 35s to terrorists. Yeah, I know. Fucking Israel has F 35s. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2734.34s)]
*  What do you mean? We have already been arming terrorists with F 35 chatter. Yeah, we should [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2741.7s)]
*  give them B 52s. We should give Iran B 52s and send them a decent number of, of those Boeing [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2745.7s)]
*  rockets, the bunker busters. It seems like Israel has a lot of tunnels. Yeah. You don't have to [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2754.02s)]
*  understand. We're so precise. We kill civilians from thousands of kilometers away. We're also [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2759.54s)]
*  so precise that we murder civilians 50 meters away. These barbarians in Iran are not precise. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2762.58s)]
*  So they kill civilians from thousands of kilometers away. Anyway, a document found in Gaza show that [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2766.98s)]
*  informed IRGC Palestine branch commander said is audio the imminent 10 seven, but it's odd. He [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2772.42s)]
*  didn't inform either Nasrallah or the IRGC high command because he didn't consider it serious. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2776.42s)]
*  It seems the Iranians underestimated Hamas as much as the Israelis did. Wait, really? I thought that [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2780.82s)]
*  was like fucking Israel trying to be like, Oh yeah, they did inform Iran, even though their previous [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2786.74s)]
*  intelligence show that they had not. That was the only moment of unity after October 7, where every [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2792.2599999999998s)]
*  outlet was like, no, Iran, Israel, America, and every, every part of foreign press was in [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2798.18s)]
*  unison collectively saying Hamas didn't inform Iran of this, of this action. But yeah, I don't [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2806.8199999999997s)]
*  really trust documents found in Gaza. Which, which is, which is the Lebanon, which is the Lebanon [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2815.06s)]
*  playbook. And we ended up seeing thousands of people dead in your war against Hezbollah [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2823.62s)]
*  last year. I just want to ask you, Lieutenant Colonel, I was on the, I was on the ground, [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2829.06s)]
*  thousand of terrorists. I was on the ground in Lebanon. We have seen thousands of people. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2834.74s)]
*  I was on the ground in Lebanon and I saw, Lieutenant Colonel, I was on the ground in Lebanon. I was [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2838.66s)]
*  seeing how you were issuing the warnings and not giving people enough time to get out. And then we [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2845.06s)]
*  saw thousands of civilians displaced and thousands killed. But I just want to ask you about- [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2850.82s)]
*  That is not true. We have seen thousands of terrorists killed in Lebanon. Successful, [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2855.06s)]
*  we have not seen thousands of- Including, including civilians, including women and children [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2859.78s)]
*  and civilians in Lebanon. Israel carried out the most- [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2867.3s)]
*  That link that that chatter sent me is literally every single air defense company and coordinates, [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2869.94s)]
*  every single one of them and coordinates of THAAD coordinates, like real-time coordinates of THAAD [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2875.8599999999997s)]
*  anti-missile systems, right triad top to bottom. And then they added [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2883.7s)]
*  Ahatollah Khomeini and a random Iranian pharmacy student is a Turkish guy. He added, he added Khomeini. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2889.46s)]
*  Most precise operation in history with the BIPA operation, we were able to hit thousands of [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2897.46s)]
*  terrorists without anyone around them being injured. You are misleading your audience. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2904.42s)]
*  Israel had the most precise operation against a terrorist- Oh, he left the interview? [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2908.26s)]
*  Toll in Lebanon in one week was higher than an entire month in- [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2916.02s)]
*  Of terrorists, of Hezbollah terrorists. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2920.66s)]

*  when I'm rating the drawers of a Lebanese compound to wear the new sexy lingerie, [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2931.38s)]
*  I'm doing that because I'm fighting against Hezbollah terrorists, okay? When we're killing women [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2941.38s)]
*  and children, we're killing Hezbollah terrorists, women and children. I get what you mean. She's not [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2947.06s)]

*  terrorists. And we've seen the same sort of operations in Gaza as well, where 60,000 people, [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2958.34s)]
*  including thousands of women and children in Gaza- I apologize a bit. Thank you. All right. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2964.1s)]
*  He took his ball and left. I was in Lebanon during the Pages situation. It was not precise. Nurses [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2969.54s)]
*  were injured since a lot of the Pagers entered economic circulation. There was such a strong [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2973.94s)]
*  sense of fear that people locked their phones and safes because they thought they would blow up. No, [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2977.3s)]
*  I know. I know. It was so fucking gross. It was so gross that they also presented it as like this [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2980.66s)]
*  incredible, sophisticated, precise attack. It's like, dude, it is directly illegal. It is the [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2988.42s)]
*  most illegal thing you can do. It is a severe violation of numerous international humanitarian [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=2993.7799999999997s)]
*  rights, rules of combat. He took Hezbollah and left. Yeah. It's so crazy that people still, [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=3000.58s)]
*  to this day, treat that as like a, not a terrorist strike, but instead as like an incredible, [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=3007.54s)]
*  an incredible act of, of, I guess an incredible sophisticated military action against like [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=3015.7799999999997s)]

*  They want to do the Dahiya doctrine for Iran. The Dahiya doctrine is the, [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=3048.98s)]
*  the death and destruction of all civilian life. That's what they [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=3052.18s)]

*  I can't tell if this is just like genuinely how comfortable Israeli society feels and not [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=3084.58s)]
*  recognizing like a, like an imminent sense of danger, lack of survival instinct. Like what the [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=3091.38s)]

*  it's again projection. I think it's because Israel does not believe Iran has a right to exist, [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=3117.22s)]
*  which is why they bombed Iran. Is there, I just don't understand. Has there ever been a moment [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=3122.66s)]

*  We have a comprehensive target bank and the Israelis must not allow themselves to be used [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=3669.22s)]

*  Considering the constant threats directed by these release over the past few weeks about the [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=3951.46s)]
*  possibility of attacks. Right now, these threats are getting translated into real [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=3956.66s)]
*  war. And also we've got this sentiment of anger among the people. And I have spoken to many in [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=3961.94s)]
*  this regard and they're saying they've got nothing to do with politics and nuclear program and [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=3967.94s)]
*  military issues. But still they're seeing their lives affected, specifically seeing that energy [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=3972.5s)]
*  infrastructures of the country were partially attacked. Today, earlier in the morning, we saw [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=3979.06s)]
*  attacks on the two of the, let's say, few of the parts of the country. One just behind me in the [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=3984.18s)]
*  thousand parts of Tehran and the smoke, the heavy, thick smoke is- Oh, Israel and Iran have both been [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=3991.2999999999997s)]
*  preparing for this confrontation. Let's watch their arsenal comparison. I'm going to move on to the [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=3998.18s)]
*  Minnesota shooter in a little bit. There's a couple more lines I want to talk about here. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4002.8199999999997s)]
*  How do you stack up? Well, on paper, Iran far outnumbers Israel in terms of active and [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4007.62s)]
*  reserve personnel. Iran is a much bigger country than Israel, 86 million people to Israel's 10 [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4011.94s)]
*  million people. So the Iranians have got 960,000 personnel. Israel have got 634,000. It's about who [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4017.06s)]
*  has the more manpower. It's really about who has the best technology, particularly in the air war. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4023.94s)]
*  And on that score, there is a clear and obvious winner. So let's look at the attack capabilities. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4029.62s)]
*  Now, first, Israel's weapon of choice- Chatter is like surprising. It's surprising seeing so many [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4034.66s)]
*  news outlets and their comment section on YouTube be like so, so not pro-Israel and anti-Israel, [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4042.34s)]
*  as a matter of fact. Anti-war, anti-Israel is like shocking. Of course, there are its fighter jets, [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4051.2200000000003s)]
*  the F-15, the F-16 and the F-35. Very stealthy. The F-35 can get through radar defenses undetected. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4055.94s)]
*  Very, very useful weapon system for the Israelis to operate. The Iranians, they operate much older [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4062.7400000000002s)]
*  Russian jets and they've lost some of them. They don't work as well. And so instead, they've built [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4067.62s)]
*  up a huge stockpile of missiles and drones and they include the Shaheed 136 that we've seen much [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4072.5s)]
*  of in Ukraine, the Imad, the Koran Shah, big missile, but this one, the Fata. There's a whole [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4077.8599999999997s)]
*  family of Fata missiles. They work. The most modern versions of them are thought to be hypersonic, [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4083.38s)]
*  which are really very difficult to defend against. In total, it's estimated that the Iranians may have [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4088.18s)]
*  3000 of these ballistic missiles. Most estimates would say it's probably near a 2000, but undoubtedly [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4093.46s)]
*  they have a lot of them and they could keep throwing them at Israel over the coming days and [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4099.14s)]
*  weeks if they chose to do that. And Israel claims that Iran was building up the capacity to manufacture [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4103.46s)]
*  300 ballistic missiles a month. And that with their ranges will put Israel on hundreds of U.S. bases [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4108.82s)]
*  in the crosshairs around the region. So if you look at a range map, undoubtedly the Iranians have a [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4114.26s)]
*  big capacity building in terms of- Yeah, bro. What are they like? Look at this. It's just Eastern [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4119.38s)]
*  Europe. Like that's the maximum area of impact is Eastern Europe. That's why it's so funny when [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4123.9400000000005s)]
*  Israel's like, they are coming after you. They will bomb. They will bomb the UK. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4129.86s)]
*  Their ballistic missiles and their drones. Now over the years, Israel has the most advanced [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4137.62s)]
*  defense system in the country because it's a small country and give them close to 100% protection. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4142.5s)]
*  But of course, no system will ever give you 100% protection. Now you can see here [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4149.06s)]
*  action over Tel Aviv. A few missiles did get through, but the vast majority were intercepted. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4153.3s)]
*  But no system, no system is ever 100% because any system can be overwhelmed with sheer numbers. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4158.820000000001s)]
*  And in that respect, we know that Iran does have the numbers, but in contrast, Iran's defense- [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4165.700000000001s)]
*  Wait, no, they did say that though. No, I know. I know. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4170.9800000000005s)]
*  No. Zipi Hotevelli says Iran's long range ballistic missiles can reach London. That's not true. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4175.54s)]
*  They do not have this capability. They're just lying. And the reason why they're lying like this [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4183.3s)]
*  is because they want to make it seem like they're fucking idiotic act of conquest against Iran. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4188.1s)]
*  That is now actually retaliation for the first time ever for Israel is something that everyone [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4195.14s)]
*  else should be on board with and everyone should be invested in Israel's defense. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4203.46s)]
*  Interesting analysis from the state of play from an Israeli source. Iran has not yet launched is [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4208.02s)]
*  one ton, one and a half ton missile, nor its cruise missiles, only the USS penetration bombs. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4212.66s)]
*  And without them, it is not possible to destroy nuclear facilities on the power limitations, [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4217.14s)]
*  the prices that are expected and the following steps. Last night after discussion, it was [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4221.14s)]
*  followed. It was allowed to publish Israel does not have the ability to destroy Iran's nuclear [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4224.5s)]
*  facilities. We knew that already. The political echelon knew this and set out with a reasonable [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4227.94s)]
*  concept, but one that public must be aware of a complex that includes attacking nuclear facilities, [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4232.26s)]
*  dismantling and Iranian anti-aircraft defenses in a way that allows Israeli fighter jets to [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4238.18s)]
*  circle over Tehran as if they were over Jabalilla, reducing the ballistic missile threat, [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4242.1s)]
*  eliminating the Iranian security elite and a credible threat to behead the heads of government [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4247.14s)]
*  and the Ayatollahs along with possible damage to national infrastructure such as oil reserves [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4250.900000000001s)]
*  may be enough. Why is it enough? Bring Iran back to the negotiation for a position of weakness that [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4254.900000000001s)]
*  will force it to sign an agreement without expiration dates and with teeth. And if not, [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4259.38s)]
*  then at least postpone the nuclear project for a few years. I don't think the nuclear project is a, [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4264.42s)]
*  is a real fear. I think that's totally fucking the seasoning. That's just Israel looking for a cause [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4268.74s)]
*  for why it's doing this. I think they just want to fucking eliminate Iranian leadership and cause [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4275.3s)]
*  Iran to be destabilized and then plant a puppet in charge. That's just their excuse because [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4281.06s)]
*  obviously, obviously, what is this 14 we're coming for you. I did text you. What do we call this? [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4290.820000000001s)]
*  Risk at all is more like is up to her. He's just like my mom can't embrace it. You okay, man? You [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4298.900000000001s)]
*  can ban don't care. I mean, I care enough to I was your driver. I heard your signal. What the [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4305.46s)]
*  fuck is this guy saying? Bro, calm down. Take your medication chatter. I'm political. No, you're [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4313.22s)]
*  insane. Anyway. Yeah, I don't think they're okay. All right, let's finish the older, weaker and [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4319.46s)]
*  they've been badly hurt by Israel already. Now the IDF have actually looked at some of these systems, [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4324.66s)]
*  the S 300, an old Russian system doesn't work that well these days. If you know where it is, [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4331.22s)]
*  the Corrad 15 and the tactical Hunter, they're okay, but they're quite old. And the IDF has [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4336.34s)]
*  released these images of them attacking Iranian surface to air missiles near Tehran. And there [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4342.26s)]
*  they are. If they can spot them, they can destroy them. They've got enough intelligence to know [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4348.1s)]
*  where they are. Even those which are mobile like the S 300. Once they've spot them, then effectively, [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4352.26s)]
*  they're dead. If the Israelis decide to go for them. Finally, Israel has the one thing that they [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4357.54s)]
*  don't want Iran to have nuclear weapons. The Jericho too. I never thought in my life that [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4363.62s)]
*  we'd be talking openly about Israel having nuclear weapons either. That's like also a new revelation. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4369.38s)]
*  I mean, it's not a new revelation at all. Everybody knew it, but like it was Israel's never admitted [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4374.5s)]
*  to having nukes. It's kind of like the knockba. Israel claims it didn't happen, but then also [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4379.46s)]
*  will sometimes you like, it should happen more frequently. And that's how they, that's, that's [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4384.42s)]
*  the nuke situation as well, where they're like, Oh, we don't have them, but also we do. And you [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4388.5s)]
*  should fucking, you know, you should be careful. What the dem nominee in 2028 is more likely to be [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4392.34s)]
*  Hassan piker than Josh Shapiro. What 4.6 million people estimated for the no Kings protest as 2% [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4399.86s)]
*  of the entire us population voters in the 2020 primary just wanted to beat Trump. Trump probably [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4405.86s)]
*  won't be on the ballot in 2028. So all voters want his rage. Of course, if them voters had a [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4412.82s)]
*  moderate coded candidate who despised Trump and talk shit about his voters and policies all the [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4416.82s)]
*  time, they would love that. I Gavin Newsom, but moderate seem to be pulling the hate, the center, [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4420.259999999999s)]
*  not the same game that won't work. I don't know how you see 6 million libs waving American flags [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4423.7s)]
*  and think what the democratic voters crave is someone who deeply hates America. I don't actually [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4428.0199999999995s)]
*  think Hassan piker will be the dem nominee. My point is about them sentiment. Dems are angry [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4432.34s)]
*  and no one is satiating that anger. It's what 2016 years as to the GOP before Trump. Did people [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4436.42s)]
*  think you're actually saying Hassan will be the dem nominee as soon as the song gets on the base [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4442.34s)]
*  stage, he would crumble. He needs to let he needs his lefty safe space in order to thrive. What is [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4447.54s)]
*  happening? Hassan is your guy. If your only issue is Palestine. Otherwise, nah, what the fuck? [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4452.18s)]
*  If she takes the challenge, I'm never running. That's crazy. And also I would not win. You think [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4456.900000000001s)]
*  liberals would ever be fucking on board with a guy like me. Are you crazy? I want to push. I want to, [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4463.3s)]
*  I want to push more appropriate candidates that have the that speak the media language [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4469.14s)]
*  that have the background. No bro, we need you as our commentator. Please think of people outside [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4476.820000000001s)]
*  of America. No, I would never be able to win a fucking serious political campaign as me as myself. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4481.860000000001s)]
*  Y'all are insane. Anyway, let's let's watch something funny for a moment. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4490.18s)]
*  Also, like, I don't understand the relationship between America and Israel. It's like it's the [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4496.42s)]
*  most effed up situation ever. We're like the world's most pathetic sugar daddy. We give them [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4501.06s)]
*  billions of dollars and they shit on us. Like Mr. Jonathan said, now we're ganging on them. We're [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4507.14s)]
*  not helpful. Dude, we gave you 30 billion dollars to bond children and it's not enough for you. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4512.02s)]
*  Like, I mean, at least at least when you pay a dominatrix, you know that you're getting fucked. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4517.9400000000005s)]
*  But this is just America having a public humiliation king while getting fucked. And [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4522.74s)]
*  they call this foreign policy. They are arresting American students on American soils for protesting [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4526.66s)]
*  Israeli war crimes. What the hell man? This is like your crack whore making you beat your children [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4532.9s)]
*  for calling her what she is a whore. This is what really boggles me in America. The right and the [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4538.74s)]
*  left, they fight each other tooth and nail over gun control, education, minorities right, health [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4546.179999999999s)]
*  care, DEI. But when it comes to Israel, everybody competes to be Israel favorite bitch. Republicans [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4552.02s)]
*  hate handouts unless it's for Israel and Democrats, they love human rights and listen for the [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4558.1s)]
*  Palestinians. I mean, this is a delulu state. You guys are delulu. Wahef Raber, you are delulu. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4563.620000000001s)]
*  Like I came here today to witness for myself, how someone can lie so shamelessly. The guy is like a [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4568.820000000001s)]
*  human pinball machine. Every question lies on him, ends on Hamas. It's like a magic eight ball with [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOkoQ7T4Xs&t=4575.540000000001s)]
