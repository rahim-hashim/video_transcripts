# Who Will Be Held Accountable For The Lost Hostages? | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo)
*  This is also true. There were, there was a, there was one instance, one very famous instance of a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=0.0s)]
*  hostage that they said had been wounded or it was a casualty. I think like there was a little bit of [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=6.8s)]
*  miscommunication. And then that actually caused a lot of chaos internally in Israel. People got mad. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=12.8s)]
*  People were saying like, you know, facilitate the ceasefire, facilitate the ceasefire. And at the [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  time, at the time people thought, or the Israeli government thought that Hamas was just bluffing [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=22.24s)]
*  claiming that some of the hostages had been killed specifically to apply pressure [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=31.04s)]
*  inside of the Israeli. Yeah. The, by the way, while we were speaking, the Israeli military [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=36.0s)]
*  has announced that one of the bodies received is not that of the captive Shiri Bebas. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=46.32s)]
*  They also claimed without providing evidence that according to the assessment of professional [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=50.56s)]
*  officials based on the intelligence available to us in forensic findings of the two children, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=53.84s)]
*  Ariel and Kfir Bebas were by terrorist in captivity in November, 2023, forensic examinations [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=57.36s)]
*  focus on the cause of death and the specifics of how the person died, such as blunt force trauma, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  shrapnel wounds, gunshot wounds or stabbing injuries are described objectively with terms [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=67.04s)]
*  like severe trauma or multiple stab wounds. However, terms like are not typically found [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=71.28s)]
*  in the official forensic reports. So don't know, don't know the validity of this forensic [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=75.2s)]
*  investigation, but I don't know what's going on with Shiri Bebas body. Was it done by an [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=82.48s)]
*  independent body? Of course not. Yeah. What's interesting. What's of course interesting about [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=88.56s)]
*  this process as I described earlier today is that in November, 2023, only a month after October seven [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=94.16s)]
*  Hamas revealed that Ariel and Kfir Bebas and Shiri Bebas had died in an Israeli airstrike. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=102.32s)]
*  They also said that they would release the bodies to Israel. Israel refused the bodies initially [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=114.47999999999999s)]
*  stating that this was simply a tactic by Hamas. I don't know why they would be willing to release [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=123.28s)]
*  the bodies to Israel if they had these hostages for no reason, for no apparent reason. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=131.36s)]
*  Will we get the truth ever? Yeah. I think in a lot of these instances you have, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=141.28s)]
*  you have a lot of journalists. You also have family members that will want to, you have a source [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  to Israel refusing the bodies. I want to send it to my mom. There was a Sky News report that [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=154.32000000000002s)]
*  we looked at earlier. Hold on. Let me see if I can find it again. But we watched it. We watched [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=158.64s)]
*  it earlier November. Oh, here it is. Wait, what is this? Times Now News. I don't know what Times [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=163.83999999999997s)]
*  Now World is. I don't know what this article is. I don't know what this media outlet is. Hamas on [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=170.39999999999998s)]
*  Thursday claimed that Israel refusing to take back the dead bodies of the Bebas family members, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=176.16s)]
*  including Kfir who's 10 months old. The Palestine group also called, also posted a video of Yarden [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=179.27999999999997s)]
*  Bebas, the father on his telegram channel. On Wednesday Hamas had claimed the 10 month old [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=184.64s)]
*  Kfir, four year old Ariel and their mother Shiri Silberman Bebas 30 were killed in Israeli [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=187.84s)]
*  bombardment. Yeah. I don't know how valid this story is, but I mean, or sorry, I don't know how [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=192.96s)]
*  valid this news outlet is, but at the time there was coverage from both Al Jazeera and even Sky News. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=199.44s)]
*  Who's a member of Hamas's political office. Thank you for joining us on Al Jazeera. So we saw an [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=205.76s)]
*  extension of that ceasefire by one day until tomorrow, 7 a.m. What's the likelihood that it [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=210.16s)]
*  will be extended again? Because all eyes are on what's going to happen tomorrow. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=215.44s)]
*  This is the seventh day of humanitarian ceasefire. We are negotiating now through [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=222.24s)]
*  Qatari foreign ministry. I spent a fair amount of time with the family over the past few weeks. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=229.44s)]
*  I was with them just yesterday and they were, as you would expect, desperately waiting for news. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=240.56s)]
*  They were confused and very upset as to why their family had not yet been released. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=247.28s)]
*  And they were trying to digest and understand the news that it was the belief that Hamas had passed [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=253.84s)]
*  their family onto another group in Gaza. So it has been just the most awful time for them as it has [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=260.88s)]
*  been for other hostage families awaiting the release of their relatives. But now the news [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=268.48s)]
*  this afternoon from the Al Qassam Brigades, which is the military wing of Hamas, that the family [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=272.88s)]
*  were killed in an airstrike at some stage. Now, I really should add some pretty heavy caveats to [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=279.20000000000005s)]
*  this. Firstly, the IDF have said they're looking into it. They have not confirmed it and I have [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=286.0s)]
*  spoken to the IDF and they will say they will get back to us on that. Secondly, there have been [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=291.52000000000004s)]
*  occasions in the last week or so when hostages who had previously been declared dead by one or [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=296.8s)]
*  more armed groups in Gaza actually turned out not to have died and have subsequently been released. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  And I'm sure that this is also true. There were, there was a, there was one instance, one very [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=312.08000000000004s)]
*  famous instance of a hostage that they said had been wounded or it was a casualty. I think like [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=319.44s)]
*  there was a little bit of miscommunication and then that actually caused a lot of chaos internally [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=325.44s)]
*  in Israel. People got mad. People were saying like, you know, facilitate the ceasefire, facilitate [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=330.24s)]
*  the ceasefire. And at the time, at the time people thought, or the Israeli government thought that [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=334.71999999999997s)]
*  Hamas was just bluffing, claiming that some of the hostages had been killed specifically to apply [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=342.56s)]
*  pressure inside of the Israeli, inside of the Israeli civil society. So there is, there is [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=348.16s)]
*  at least a little bit of skepticism for that reason as well. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=359.04s)]
*  That is something that the family will be clinging onto tonight, but it comes as this truce, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=361.68s)]
*  as it currently stands, is getting close to the end. If no extension is agreed tonight, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=369.52000000000004s)]
*  we expect 10 more Israelis. I'm confused. Can you more, can you be more clear who claimed they were [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=376.40000000000003s)]
*  dead? Israel or Hamas Hamas claimed that the mother and the two children, the two babies [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=383.04s)]
*  were killed in an Israeli airstrike. Okay. They also said that they would in the, this was during [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=390.24s)]
*  the brief ceasefire ceasefire negotiation period as well. Okay. Israel at the time claimed that it [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=399.36s)]
*  was made up like, or was skeptical about it saying that they perhaps have not been killed [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=407.36s)]
*  and Hamas is bluffing. Okay. This was how far back was that claim? November, 2023. We're watching a [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=413.68s)]
*  news report from November 29th, 2023. Hamas's arm wing has claimed three members of the Bebas [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=421.84s)]
*  family have been killed inside Gaza or nationals to be released from Gaza. In return, Israel will [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=430.0s)]
*  release 30 Palestinians from Israeli jails. And then the mediations behind the scenes are continuing [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=436.88s)]
*  to try and see that it is extended. The Israelis believe that there are many more women and children [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=442.4s)]
*  in Gaza enough at least to extend the truce by two to three more days. If Hamas would agree to [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=448.88s)]
*  release them, Hamas have said that they are willing to extend it. Yeah. They said that they were [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=455.84s)]
*  willing to release the bodies, by the way, it is kind of maddening that we're discussing whether [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=461.92s)]
*  Hamas killed some hostages deliberately while we have evidence of Israelis raping Palestinian [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=466.88s)]
*  hostages, the death on concentration camps and filming it. Yes. That is, that is the dynamic here. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=470.15999999999997s)]
*  And yes, the father was separated from the family chatter. Who's asking, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=475.6s)]
*  what would they gain from lying about it? This chatter says, I'm not saying they are. I'm saying [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=480.56s)]
*  if the father was captured with them, he would know if they're alive or not, unless they were [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=483.52s)]
*  separated, which is what I'm assuming. Yes, they were separated. Yes. The father was separated from [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=486.56s)]
*  the mother and the children, the mother and the children were together. This was again in November, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=490.96s)]
*  2023. Okay. The arm way, the Palestinian militant group Hamas said on Wednesday, the 10 month old [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=496.15999999999997s)]
*  Kiefer Bivas, his four year old brother and their mother were killed in previous Israeli [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=501.68s)]
*  bombardment of the Gaza strip. The Israeli army said it is checking the claim by Al Qassam [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=504.64s)]
*  brigades. Reuters could not immediately independently verify the claim. Having said that I do not know [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=508.88s)]
*  what happened. Obviously I'm simply telling you what the news reporting was at the time and also [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=514.88s)]
*  matching that with like the logical matching that with like the logical actions that either party [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=523.36s)]
*  would take. Okay. This is what Hamas claims. Israel hasn't said shit about this as far as I know. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=533.28s)]
*  Right? No. Israel now is saying if Israel was certain it was Hamas, wouldn't they strongly [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=537.92s)]
*  deny their claim? No. Israel is now saying that they received the bodies of the Bivas family. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=544.8000000000001s)]
*  Okay. And that they are claiming that forensics investigations were done and that the investigation [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=549.8399999999999s)]
*  concluded that the children were by Hamas. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=560.2399999999999s)]
*  On the completion of the identification process by the national Institute of forensic medicine [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=564.8s)]
*  in collaboration with the Israel police IDF representatives informed the Bivas family that [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=567.92s)]
*  their loved ones, Ariel and Kiefer Bivas have been identified. According to the assessment of [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=571.1999999999999s)]
*  professional officials based on the intelligence available to us and forensic findings from the [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=575.04s)]
*  identification process, Ariel and Kiefer Bivas were by terrorist in captivity in November, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=578.64s)]
*  2023. This is the post from the IDF during the identification process was determined that the [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=583.52s)]
*  additional body received is not that of Shiri Bivas and no match was found for any other hostage. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=588.96s)]
*  This is an anonymous unidentified body. This is a violation of utmost severity by the Hamas [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=596.48s)]
*  terrorist organization, which is obligated under the agreement to return four deceased hostages. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=600.64s)]
*  We demand that a mosque return Shiri home along with all of our hostages. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=604.48s)]
*  Didn't they just get the remains? How can they conclude it this quickly? I mean, I don't know. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=609.52s)]
*  They, they, they could be, they could be just lying. They could have conducted a faulty [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=612.8000000000001s)]
*  investigation or they could be telling the truth, which is, you know, I'm just matching what Israel [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=620.48s)]
*  has done in the past. Your Chad have brain rot. They hate Israel so much. They lack judgment in [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=626.08s)]
*  terms of, in terms of like what the logical conclusion is or what the logic behind Hamas [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=631.36s)]
*  giving up a wrong body. I don't know why they would pull up. Ha ha. We did this to fuck with [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=638.64s)]
*  you type situation. Here's the previous. She's blaming Israel for trying to bomb the places [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=645.04s)]
*  they were held in. Yeah, this is a mother of release Israeli prisoner of war. Now I'm a Hallevi [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=648.88s)]
*  from her time in captivity. She mainly has an anger. She mainly has anger towards the state. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=656.0s)]
*  She feels they try to kill her because they bombed the house that she was in. In one case, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=659.68s)]
*  they got out last minute, the wall fell and she was injured. She has hard stories. Her biggest fear [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=662.88s)]
*  was our bombings. This has been the most consistent. This has been the most consistent [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=667.1999999999999s)]
*  firsthand testimony from the hostages that have been released. Okay. If they were killed in a [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=673.8399999999999s)]
*  bombing with other people and couldn't get the bodies until they already decayed, it could be [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=678.0s)]
*  possible that it was mixed up. Yes, there is a possibility there as well for sure. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=682.4799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=689.68s)]
*  I think that, I think that in terms of the mother, I think that in terms of the mother, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=694.9599999999999s)]
*  they might've tried to recover the bodies from under the rubble and mistakenly mistakenly [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=704.0s)]
*  recovered the wrong body. This also happened super early in November at a time when there [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=711.28s)]
*  were many different militant factions, including criminal organizations that had also taken [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=717.04s)]
*  hostages, like just criminal elements that have nothing to do with the Palestinian liberation [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=723.12s)]
*  movement or anything like that. They were not PFLP, DFLP, FATAS, armed wing, Palestinian Islamic [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=729.28s)]
*  Jihad or Hamas, or any number of different groups that were collaborating with one another. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=736.4s)]
*  And it could have been one of those groups that had, that had kidnapped these people. Apparently [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=741.5999999999999s)]
*  she was the lady from that video that allegedly got sexually assaulted. Has there been any [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=749.76s)]
*  information from that story? Wait, what? Yeah. I doubt the idea of his lying about the body being [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=752.7199999999999s)]
*  wrong. It's more likely that a faulty DNA test on the side of, or it makes up on the bodies on [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=756.56s)]
*  Hamas side. No, that's what I think as well. I don't think the idea of his lying about [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=760.0799999999999s)]
*  the body not belonging to the actual person. I think there, there, I mean, I don't know how, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=764.0s)]
*  I don't know about, I don't know enough information about the forensic evidence [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=770.24s)]
*  revelations in terms of like the children being brutally murdered by Hamas. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=774.32s)]
*  Well, Nama Halevi was frightened to death of the bombings. Israelis were using her bloody pants [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=782.8000000000001s)]
*  video from October 7th to push more and more force. Sorry. It's Nama Levy, not Nama Halevi. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=787.12s)]
*  I agree with you, but it's a bold claim to make. Wait, what is not to think that Israel and the [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=793.0400000000001s)]
*  U S media was see Hamas in good faith. No, wait, what? What do you, I'm confused. What, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=797.68s)]
*  what claim did I make? I didn't make a claim at all. An anonymous unidentified body seems weird [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=802.88s)]
*  that there's a hostage they knew nothing of unless the Palestinian then Hamas definitely [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=807.52s)]
*  wouldn't have given that body over on purpose. No, I think it, they might've accidentally, dude, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=811.8399999999999s)]
*  if it's a, if it's under the rubble, I don't know when they extracted the bodies. I don't know. I [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=816.0s)]
*  don't know at what point they extract the bodies. You have to remember the bombing campaigns are [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=820.3199999999999s)]
*  endless at this point. This is in November. Okay. I don't know who was capable of extracting these [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=823.6s)]
*  bodies. I don't know what their, what their recovery, I don't know what their, but their [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=829.6800000000001s)]
*  recovery strategies look like. I don't know what the, how they maintain the bodies at this point. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=836.64s)]
*  It's November of 2023, not 2024, 2023, a month after the Israel bombing campaign started. You [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=842.24s)]
*  understand Israel literally holds over 600 Palestinian dead bodies going back several [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=850.88s)]
*  decades. They just keep them. No, I know. Even when a song is giving Israel the benefit of doubt, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=854.56s)]
*  he's still making bold claims. Law. I don't think that was what that chatter was implying. I think [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=859.12s)]
*  that chatter probably misunderstood what I was saying. I feel like if Israel finally had concrete [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=863.2s)]
*  proof, Hamas finally killed a baby. They wouldn't hesitate to put it out there. We'll see, but there [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=867.2s)]
*  has been an ongoing legal issue with, there has been an ongoing legal issue with, what do you call [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=872.64s)]
*  it? But the fact that the fourth body is not the mother is actually fairly shocking. Yeah. Mind you, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=881.76s)]
*  this doesn't suit the possibility of random. This is co-founder of nine seven two magazine, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=885.76s)]
*  Demi writer. This is the Israeli investigative reporting magazine that I have routinely relied [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=891.6s)]
*  on for some really good investigative reporting, brutally murdered in captivity is routine IDF lingo [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=901.12s)]
*  regarding dead hostages, whatever slash whoever immediate cause of death. In other words, we [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=905.68s)]
*  won't be releasing the autopsy report just yet. Remember this is plus nine seven two magazines, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=909.52s)]
*  Israeli investigative reporting outlet. But the fact that the fourth body is not their mother is [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=914.16s)]
*  actually fairly shocking. What the actual fuck. Yeah. That part is actually the most surprising [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=918.4s)]
*  aspect of this because that the fact that Israel is saying that this is not the correct body [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=923.04s)]
*  means that there is most likely a mix up that happened on the Hamas side. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=930.88s)]
*  I'm inclined to believe Israel when they say, I can't believe I'm saying this. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=934.64s)]
*  I'm inclined to believe Israel when they say that this is not the correct body. I'm also [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=938.4799999999999s)]
*  judging by past performance from the Hamas side. I'm not talking about the forensic reporting. I'm [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=946.7199999999999s)]
*  talking specifically about the mother's body. Okay. But I don't think this was a deliberate [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=952.96s)]
*  act of trickery from the Hamas side. And I think most likely it is a mix up that they engaged in. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=961.9200000000001s)]
*  We'll know. We'll know soon enough. If we'll know soon enough when if and when Hamas [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=970.8000000000001s)]
*  releases their statement. Okay. There are a multitude of different factors at play in terms [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=977.76s)]
*  of why they could have recovered the wrong body thinking that it was actually the body of [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=984.3199999999999s)]
*  of the mother. Okay. But I think you've seen enough people remains inside of trash bags in [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=988.64s)]
*  Gaza to understand why it would be incredibly difficult to figure out exactly who whose body [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=998.16s)]
*  belongs to who these bodies have been under constant bombardment and have been actively [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=1004.32s)]
*  decomposing for over a year now is genuinely likely that it was a mix up for those reasons. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=1007.2s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Mind you, this doesn't exclude the possibility of the random gang slash mega [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=1010.6400000000001s)]
*  Echos esoteric militant group that held the kids actually did kill them. But idea vagueness hardly [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=1014.4000000000001s)]
*  dispel suspicions. They too were victims of ideas his own indiscriminate assault. Okay. Well, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=1019.12s)]
*  I don't know. They didn't wait for a year to collect the body. They collect this soon after. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=1024.16s)]
*  No, I know they collected it soon after, but even in that chaos, they might have accidentally [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=1028.16s)]
*  collected the wrong body. That's my point. Do you not understand? I'm saying that they're being [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=1034.56s)]
*  constantly bombarded. There is a very high likelihood that they, they grabbed the wrong [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=1041.6799999999998s)]
*  body thinking that it was the body of the mother. The only thing I have to judge this by [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=1047.36s)]
*  is the fact that Hamas, the only thing, the only fact I have in support of this being potentially [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=1053.6799999999998s)]
*  a mix up on the Hamas side is the fact that Hamas said that they would release these bodies to [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=1060.4s)]
*  Israel literally a year and a half ago in November when they were first initially killed. Okay. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=1064.88s)]
*  How the fuck would Israel know if they had the wrong body? Accidents happen. Wait, what do you [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=1073.0400000000002s)]
*  mean? They have forensic data. They can literally match her dental records. Anyway, will Israel [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=1076.16s)]
*  further and more violently, more intently violate the ceasefire agreement? It uses a justification [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=1081.1200000000001s)]
*  potentially, but I think one of the major roles, one of the major aspects of why the ceasefire is [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=1087.12s)]
*  held is because I suspect that there is not a lot of appetite from the Israeli side, or at least [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=1092.0s)]
*  like logistically, they're not ready to go back into the Gaza strip. I think that is the, the [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=1097.84s)]
*  greatest deterrence here. If you know what I mean, the greatest deterrence against Israel invading [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=1104.1599999999999s)]
*  Gaza currently is their appetite for permanently annexing the West bank. That's number one. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=1110.6399999999999s)]
*  And also the fact that they just simply do not want to mobilize in Gaza. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwoG7zjYgo&t=1116.32s)]
