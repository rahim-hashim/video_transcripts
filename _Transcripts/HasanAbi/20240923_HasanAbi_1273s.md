# Explosive Letter from Alleged Trump Assassin | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [September 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y)
*  No one here in the U S seems to have the balls to put natural selection to work or even unnatural [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=0.0s)]
*  selection. That's crazy. He's just, he's wild, dude. Ryan, Ruth is a wild man. Okay. He's God. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=4.24s)]
*  I love this guy so much. It is so much content. He was built different. He's like, Iran, you can [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=12.16s)]
*  meet for voting for Donald Trump. My mistake. Yeah. By the way, that makes it even funnier [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=17.12s)]
*  like he voted for Donald Trump in 2016. It makes things so much funnier. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=22.64s)]
*  Now let's, let's talk about Ryan, Ruth. So originally I joked and said, if Ryan, Ruth [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=32.56s)]
*  did not like release a written statement or a prerecorded statement, you know, you could [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=39.84s)]
*  potentially lower his charges because he's technically not even like violating, especially [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=46.08s)]
*  if it wasn't like brandishing. Oh, if it was just like kind of their second amendment, baby, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=52.08s)]
*  you know what I mean? You're just like, that's how American laws are. Right. But it turns out, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=57.04s)]
*  it turns out he has openly shown his intent. No, there is provable intent. You're wrong. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=63.68s)]
*  There is definitely provable intent. He wrote a literal letter chat. Come on. There is definitely [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=71.68s)]
*  provable intent. Let's take a look. This is a Fox news alert. In about two hours, the suspect [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=77.92s)]
*  in the second attempt against former president Donald Trump will be back in federal court [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=82.8s)]
*  where a judge will determine whether he can be released on bail. Brooke Singman has brand new [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=86.88s)]
*  reporting that has come out in the last half hour about the suspect's movements and a note he wrote [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=92.0s)]
*  long before the attempt. Brooke. Yeah, that's right guys. So Ryan, Ruth will appear in a West Palm [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=98.4s)]
*  Beach courtroom today at 11 a.m. Eastern time. This is the DOJ releases this letter from Ruth [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=103.28s)]
*  where he says, quote, this was an attempt on Donald Trump. Now this letter came from a civilian [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  that contacted police after they say Ruth dropped off a box at their house several months prior to [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=114.4s)]
*  the wait. What? Okay. Okay. This sounds like too good to be true. And it sounds like almost fake. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=120.08s)]
*  But honestly, this dude was so insane that I believe it. Like he wrote, I read the letter. I [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=126.56s)]
*  didn't know how they actually found the letter. The letter, if you read it, sounds insane. Like [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=131.92s)]
*  sounds too good to be true, right? If you are trying to put together a prosecution and you [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=137.83999999999997s)]
*  happen upon a letter like this, you're like, come on, dude, what the? I mean, this is the easiest [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=144.16s)]
*  lock of the century. Okay. Anyway, it feels a little too good to be true. But the only reason why [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=149.2s)]
*  I still am committed to believing that it is real is because he is that insane and he has a pen [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=155.44s)]
*  shot for writing in general. The attempt after learning of the incident, the witness opened this [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=162.64s)]
*  box and found ammunition with the letter that also says he will offer $150,000 to whoever can, quote, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=167.68s)]
*  complete the job if he failed. The DOJ also saying Ruth had six cell phones and two license plates [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=175.6s)]
*  and his internet history revealed he looked up Trump locations into October and how to travel [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=182.16s)]
*  from Palm Beach to Mexico. Last week, he was charged with possession of a firearm by convicted [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. The charges came after [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=193.6s)]
*  a Secret Service agent noticed what appeared to be a rifle poking out of a chain link fence at [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=198.48s)]
*  former President Trump's Florida golf course while Trump was golfing. The Secret Service agent fired [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=203.6s)]
*  in that direction of the rifle. A witness spotted Ruth then fleeing from the area and he was arrested [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=208.64s)]
*  shortly after. Now, the two charges carry a combined maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  but federal prosecutors say stronger charges could be coming. Meanwhile, the House has unanimously [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=219.44s)]
*  passed a bill to enhance Secret Service protection for presidential candidates and that bill is now [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=224.95999999999998s)]
*  heading to the Senate. Guys. Brooke, thank you very much. This, this, so many questions. No, no, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=229.83999999999997s)]
*  as you guys know, as a small government conservative, I find it abhorrent, repugnant [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=235.12s)]
*  that we are wasting our government resources like this. All of that money should be going to Israel. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=241.76s)]
*  Unacceptable. Every dollar that is now spent on Secret Service detail with extra security protocols [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=246.88s)]
*  and extra protections for people running for president. Okay. All of those dollars should be [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=253.36s)]
*  going to the beautiful moral state of Israel and I find it unconscionable that we're spending it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=257.68s)]
*  We're wasting it as a small government conservative. This is what I believe also that [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=262.64s)]
*  women do not have bodily autonomy and that we should interfere in their affairs in what happens [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=266.64s)]
*  in their own personal lives and a decision that they need to make a medical one between themselves [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=273.28s)]
*  as patients and the doctor. This is what I believe as a small government conservative. Anyway, let's [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=279.28s)]
*  continue. No kidding. So months ago, Ruth drops off at somebody's house, a box, and the person [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=285.44s)]
*  didn't open it until Ruth popped up in the news. So obviously this is just pure conjecture, but [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=291.92s)]
*  obviously it seems like, just like in the movies, dropped the box off and said, hey, if anything [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=298.88s)]
*  happens to me, open the box. And in the box, ammo, a metal pipe, building materials, tools, four [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=304.08000000000004s)]
*  phones, various letters. What's interesting is it sounds like he had no intentions of being [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=310.40000000000003s)]
*  by return fire because they were trying, he was trying to figure out how to get to Mexico. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=317.92s)]
*  The plates on the Nissan not registered actually that car. So he had a bunch of extra plates. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=324.72s)]
*  He had a two additional license plate. He had six cell phones and all. Dude, this is one of those [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=330.0s)]
*  weird cases where it just like, it reads so perfectly like a Psyop. Like it is so, it has [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=337.04s)]
*  all the telltale markings of like a dude who got like activated as a sleeper cell, just [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=342.8s)]
*  schizophrenic guy. It reminds me of like the AT&T bombing that happened. You know what I'm talking [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=350.40000000000003s)]
*  about? Like a while back where it was just like so strange where like, or the great, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=354.8s)]
*  big Gresh kidnapping, like it just has all the telltale markers. And, and yet I still, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=361.12s)]
*  I still personally believe that this dude, like I can't understand what it would be the additional [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=368.32s)]
*  reasoning as to why, what would be the background reasoning for why, you know, this would be a [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=375.36s)]
*  a Psyop, I guess, you know? So I do still think that this is like homegrown. I think we're doing [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=381.6s)]
*  it to ourselves. It's like the same principle behind like, you know, J. Edgar Hoover no longer [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=387.2s)]
*  has to besmirch the reputation of like, you know, black community leaders and whatnot. It's just [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=394.0s)]
*  like people do that on TikTok anyway. You know what I mean? Although it does feel weird. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=400.32s)]
*  He had 12 pairs of gloves. What's, what's questionable though is in this letter, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=405.52000000000004s)]
*  it says this was an attempt on Donald Trump, but I failed you. I tried my best, gave it all my [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=410.16s)]
*  gumption that I could mustard. So does that mean he's tried in the past or was he talking about [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=414.64s)]
*  this latest one? I also think based on this letter, can we stop saying we don't know the motive? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=419.84s)]
*  I mean, it's pretty clear in the letter what his motive and why he decided to do this and who was [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=424.56s)]
*  it. I do find this funny though, because like Republicans will now be like, well, there you [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=430.4s)]
*  have it. The motive is right in writing, right? Which is really interesting to consider because [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=436.08s)]
*  every single white supremacist mass shooter has directly told what their motive is. And yet they [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=440.88s)]
*  always are like, who could tell why these guys did this? You know, who could really tell why the [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=445.92s)]
*  dude that went to the, the, the blackest part of Buffalo, New York specifically to shoot up [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=452.0s)]
*  a market that openly wrote why he was doing that a total mystery. How could we ever figure out what [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=461.28000000000003s)]
*  the motivations behind like a white supremacist act of terror is when they very clearly wrote out [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=469.36s)]
*  what their motivations were. What I also find additionally interesting is that the DOJ released [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=476.56s)]
*  this letter because normally they hide that in an effort not to cause copycats. And I don't know why [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=481.44s)]
*  the, they released the letter because the letter literally is like, it's almost like a call to arms [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=487.04s)]
*  and it just straight up doesn't make sense. Normally they would keep that show under wraps, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=492.0s)]
*  especially when the target is a high profile target like the president. You know, it's weird. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=496.0s)]
*  Tend to target. I'm so sick of these press conferences where they come out for instance, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=500.4s)]
*  we don't know yet. We don't know his motivations. We don't know why he decides to do that. He [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=505.04s)]
*  spelled it out is what we would call in the legal field or criminal justice field as his manifesto. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=508.64s)]
*  This is the manifesto. He even tells the person if he, if he can't finish it, someone else, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=514.8s)]
*  he asked someone else to finish and that he was going to give him, I think a hundred. Yeah, bro. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=520.0s)]
*  That's why it's weird that you're like, you have the printout in your hand and you're just like [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=524.24s)]
*  repeating it over and over again. Like it's the top of the hour ad break, which comes to the top [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=528.4s)]
*  of every hour. And if you no longer want to see those ads, all you need to do is subscribe, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=532.8s)]
*  which you could do for $6 or fruitless prime by connecting your Amazon prime account through [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=535.84s)]
*  tuition account, you know, but it's, it's odd. It's odd that he's like waving that around and [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=540.24s)]
*  like repeating it over and over again. Cause it's like, do you want people to make additional [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=545.28s)]
*  attempts? I just don't get it. Like, yeah. Also, I do not believe even for a brief moment that he [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=550.24s)]
*  had $150,000 spare to just like give to someone who would, you know, complete the, just like, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=556.24s)]
*  I don't believe he had 1000 NATO trained Afghan fighters ready to go to Ukraine. Okay. I think [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=563.84s)]
*  he was a crack head, which are usually very, you know, decent targets for intelligence. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=570.64s)]
*  Like patsies. You'd be surprised. Sketchy. Roovers can make bank. No $50,000. So this is a [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=576.72s)]
*  manifesto. We know the motive in that we should stop saying, well, they'll have to prove that he [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=584.72s)]
*  actually wrote this letter that this was actually Ruth. And what attempt is he talking about? Is [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=588.96s)]
*  there another one that he tried and he failed? And also today the judge is going to decide if he can [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=594.64s)]
*  be released on bail. We interviewed Jonathan Turley. He said, I doubt it. He probably will hold him, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=598.72s)]
*  but he's being held for having a gun even as a felon, which is illegal. And then taking off [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=603.2s)]
*  the serial number of the gun, but not charged yet with anything with any stricter laws, like trying [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=608.72s)]
*  to a president or trying to a secret service officer. So, um, the attorney general for the [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=615.84s)]
*  state of Florida, she has said that they are expecting charges against him. At the very least, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=621.0400000000001s)]
*  it shows premeditation. It shows that he had a plan. Uh, and so let's see where they go with it, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=626.6400000000001s)]
*  because now it's in the, the ball is in the fed's court to figure out the new charges. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=632.88s)]
*  But clearly even on those two, uh, charges, gun charges that he's being held on, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=637.52s)]
*  he could wind up in prison for over 20 years. Yeah. But for the, just those two charges, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=642.08s)]

*  Dear world. Oh, here, here, here, here, here, here. Dear world. This was an attempt on Donald Trump, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=742.32s)]
*  but I'm so sorry I failed you. I try. Wait, how did he know? What if he actually got away with it? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=747.92s)]
*  Dog? Like I just don't get, I don't get how he knew he was going to fail. You know, is he a time [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=753.12s)]
*  traveler? How does he know, bro? Yo, he wrote two letters. Okay. So why did the person he dropped [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=757.92s)]
*  off this box to only reveal one of the two letters? Like what the guy is like not loyal to him enough [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=765.28s)]
*  to like leak this, but also so loyal, but also so loyal that he's like secretly only revealing the [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=772.24s)]
*  failed attempt letter is shocking that this man has no self-confidence, especially when, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=779.92s)]
*  when you think about like all of his many attempts of getting Dave Matthews, the right, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=786.0s)]
*  the greatest song of all time to save the world, which Dave Matthews obviously refused to [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=789.76s)]

*  I failed you. I tried my best and gave it all I've got. Wait, what? And gave it all the gumption I [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=803.28s)]
*  could muster. Yeah. He thought he says I tried my best and gave it all the gumption I could muster. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=808.64s)]
*  It is up to you now to finish the job and I will offer you $150,000 to whomever can complete the [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=815.1999999999999s)]
*  job. Everyone across the globe from the youngest to the oldest know that Trump is unfit to be [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=820.0799999999999s)]
*  anything much less a US president. US presidents must at bare minimum embody the moral fabric that [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=825.6s)]
*  is America and be kind, caring and selfless and always stand for humanity. Trump fails. Wait, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=831.6s)]
*  where is it? Where's the rest of it? Trump fails to understand that. I mean, it just feels weird, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=840.32s)]
*  man. Something about this is like, it just smells odd. I just don't understand why a guy who tweets [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=846.8000000000001s)]
*  everything wouldn't just tweet this, you know what I mean? He was tweeting his cell phone number [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=851.44s)]
*  over and over again. And this also seems like a lot more, this seems more coherent than his other [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=856.1600000000001s)]
*  ramblings. I tried my best and gave it all the gumption I could muster. Everyone across the [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=862.0s)]
*  globe, youngest to the oldest. Yeah. Also, how the f*** would he pay $150,000 if he failed? If he's [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=865.44s)]
*  recognizing that he failed the attempt in this letter, how was he ever going to pay the $150,000 [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=871.36s)]
*  anyway? I don't know. Elsewhere in the letter, the suspect ripped Trump's foreign policy. He, the [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=876.24s)]
*  former president, ended relations with Iran like a child and now the Middle East has unraveled. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=880.64s)]
*  Once again, you know, wrong guy to say these things, but he has the right message. Okay, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=885.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm sorry. Ryan Jebediah-Ruth, he is not incorrect in his analysis in terms of what President Donald [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=891.1999999999999s)]
*  Trump did. All I'm saying is, you know, he's a NATO guy. I am not a fan of NATO, as you guys know. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=898.3199999999999s)]
*  Okay, but he's right about this. He was also a NATO guy who was like super anti-China, but also was [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=906.4s)]
*  like pro, like normalizing relations with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Prosecutors [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=913.36s)]
*  are arguing that Ruiz should be kept in jail ahead of trial while federal public defender Christy [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=919.92s)]
*  Militello asked for the defendants to be allowed alive to live with his sister in North Carolina [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=923.68s)]
*  as the case goes forward. Ruiz was taken into custody after a Secret Service agent spotted the [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=927.92s)]
*  muscle of SKS. So wait, where, how did they, how did they find the contents? God, I hate Fox News [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=931.36s)]
*  so much. Like, aside from the fact that they are obviously a propaganda rag, it is very deeply [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=939.76s)]
*  frustrating that like they don't even do like basic, basic journalism so that you could accidentally [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=945.8399999999999s)]
*  find at least something that you didn't know about a story. Like they didn't even mention like how [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=952.3199999999999s)]
*  the DOJ came upon this, this, this treasure trove of proof. Like they basically said they gave it [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=956.88s)]
*  to someone, but like I need more details, right? Like I need more details. I want to parse through [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=963.68s)]
*  it. It just seems very weird that he would like give evidence of his like potential foiled attempt [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=969.52s)]
*  of the, you know, little candidate. Like why would he just like hand deliver a piece of evidence [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=976.8s)]
*  before doing the dang thing to some random person? Was it a random person? Who do they give it to? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=983.28s)]
*  Where did they find it? You know, page seven. Okay. Here's what has been revealed to us about [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=989.52s)]
*  all the info that they have as part of this investigation. FBI has just recently reviewed [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=996.0799999999999s)]
*  a book apparently authored by Ruth in February titled The Crane's Unwinnable War. I can't believe [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=999.6s)]
*  that I had to read that, dude. That's so funny. Imagine that's your job at the FBI. All right, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=1004.0s)]
*  bye. Your job at the FBI is to read the psychotic ramblings of a madman, to pick apart anything that [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=1009.44s)]
*  has a semblance of like sanity in there to be like, well, we uncovered his motivation. That's gotta [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=1016.48s)]
*  suck, dude. New York Times is now officially gone. They've left the building. Okay. In the book, Ruth [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=1022.48s)]
*  stated that he must take part of the blame for the person that we elected for our next president [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=1029.76s)]
*  ended up being brainless, but I'm man enough to say I misjudged and made a terrible mistake. And [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=1033.44s)]
*  Iran, I apologize. You are free to Trump as well as me for that error in judgment and the dismantling [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=1037.76s)]
*  of the deal. No one here in the U S seems to have the balls to put natural selection to work or even [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=1043.68s)]
*  unnatural selection. That's crazy. He's just, he's wild, dude. Ryan, Ruth is a wild man. Okay. He's [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=1048.08s)]
*  God. I love this guy so much. It is so much content. He was built different. He's like, Iran, you can [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=1056.32s)]
*  me for voting for Donald Trump. My mistake. Yeah, by the way, that makes it even funnier because like [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=1061.6s)]
*  he voted for Donald Trump in 2016, it makes things so much funnier. Yet another former Trump supporter [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=1067.44s)]
*  trying to Trump on September 18th, 2024 law enforcement contact by civilian witness who [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=1074.0800000000002s)]

*  Why would you not open that box? If someone drops a box off at you also, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=1094.0s)]
*  are you random? What's your association with this guy? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=1098.8s)]
*  It makes no sense. The witness stated the box contained ammunition, a metal pipe, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=1108.8s)]
*  miscellaneous building materials, tools, four phones, various letters, one handwritten letter [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzTJPdxeR9Y&t=1114.8s)]
