# Romania: Who Is Calin Georgescu? | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [November 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao)
*  But I like, I want to bring this back to American politics for a second, but I suspect that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=0.0s)]
*  look, I don't know the exact situation in Romania, but I assume it's probably not that [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=7.44s)]
*  different than America where people are angry and frustrated at the institutions after a [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=12.18s)]
*  multiple decades of austerity. At least that is the case in a lot of Western European countries [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=18.68s)]
*  where you're seeing a massive momentum and mobilization. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=23.82s)]
*  Now let's talk about the Romanian elections because some crazy happen here. Right wing [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=33.3s)]
*  Colin Georgevsku. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=38.06s)]
*  To Romania next and a political earthquake in the making. The first round of the presidential [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=40.019999999999996s)]
*  election saw a pro-Russia candidate claim the most votes, knocking the- [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=46.1s)]
*  Ukrainians are not pro-Putin the f***. I didn't say that. I said Ukrainians, 52% of Ukrainians [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=51.18s)]
*  now at least according to the latest estimates, want a ceasefire negotiation. I never said [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=57.86s)]
*  the Ukrainians are f***ing pro-Putin. What the f***? Why would they be pro-Putin? Putin [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=62.7s)]
*  is killing their f***ing family members. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=68.30000000000001s)]
*  The pro-European prime minister out of the race in the process. Now with nearly all of [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=70.5s)]
*  the votes counted, the far right independent Colin Georgevsku found himself with about [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=75.82000000000001s)]
*  23% of the votes. With the centre right candidate Elena Lascone just behind, a run off election [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=80.66s)]
*  will be held in two weeks to decide the winner. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=87.1s)]
*  And joining me now from the Romanian capital Bucharest is political scientist Oana Valentina [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=92.86s)]
*  Suciu. Welcome to DW, Oana Valentina. Colin Georgevsku came seemingly out of nowhere and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=97.94s)]
*  knocked the pro-West. It's so crazy that just everyone is a right winger by the way. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=105.54s)]
*  Like what the f*** is going on? It's just like, it seems like in Europe and in America and [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=110.58000000000001s)]
*  most places on the planet, it's now a heated battle between the far right and centre right, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=116.10000000000001s)]
*  including in America that the battle, the political battle that just took place. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=121.94s)]
*  An incumbent out of this presidential race. Can you tell us a little bit more about what [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=125.86000000000001s)]
*  he stands for and why he suddenly becomes so popular? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=130.98000000000002s)]
*  Well, first of all, he didn't really come out of nowhere because he's been quite active in the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=134.18s)]
*  public space since the previous elections. His name has been associated with the one of the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=142.02s)]
*  extremist far right party, the union, the Alliance for the Union of Romanians. What he stands for, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=151.94s)]
*  his what? Uruguay just elected a social Democrat versus a centre right candidate. Uruguay's leftist [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=161.7s)]
*  party. The broad front is one presidential elections defeated the ruling neoliberal [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=169.29999999999998s)]
*  government of president. And look, how they pull the president like the Amandu or see is seen as [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=172.42s)]
*  the protege of Pepe Mujica, former president leftist guerrilla fighter. We, we call yeah, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=176.57999999999998s)]
*  South America is experiencing with the exception of Argentina, but we don't really talk about [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=184.17999999999998s)]
*  Argentina anyway. But South America is experiencing like a social democratic resurgence [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=188.18s)]
*  for the most part, while seemingly many of the other many of the other countries firmly within [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=194.42000000000002s)]
*  the influence and sphere, the sphere of influence of America is experiencing central right to far [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=199.46s)]
*  right parties winning elections. And it's usually the far right that are gaining momentum populist. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=207.22s)]
*  He is very pro Russian. He is anti NATO, anti the European EU values, anti democracy in favour of [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=213.54s)]
*  a, I like, I want to bring this back to American politics for a second, but I suspect that, look, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=226.5s)]
*  I don't know the exact situation in Romania, but I assume it's probably not that different than [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=234.82s)]
*  America where people are angry and frustrated at the institutions after a multiple decades of [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=239.14s)]
*  austerity. At least that is the case in a lot of Western European countries where you're seeing a [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=246.57999999999998s)]
*  massive momentum and mobilization in the fascist and far right groups. So I suspect that they're [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=251.54s)]
*  angry at neoliberal management of democracy and they're experiencing like economic shocks [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=258.65999999999997s)]
*  from global inflation. Like the post we're living in the post COVID world basically, where [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=266.42s)]
*  a lot of the, all the powder kegs that were waiting to explode is, is, is now finally [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=273.06s)]
*  exploding post cold war, post neoliberal victory, neoliberalism becoming the global hegemonic [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=280.5s)]
*  attitude with center right leadership, desperately trying to maintain its status. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=287.3s)]
*  And the, and usually as liberalism is failing, fascists are coming in to point to all of the [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=293.94s)]
*  failures and saying, look, we're going to, we're going to, it's not doing right by you. We're going [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=301.3s)]
*  to blow up and focusing on, you know, immigration, focusing on, focusing on, on marginalized [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=307.46s)]
*  populations and how they are causing these problems and, and, and making the population [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=317.14s)]
*  even more reactionary, even more right wing by beefing up isolationist nationalist sentiment. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=325.38s)]
*  A strong handed leader. Some of his messages refer to Romania not respecting the rules [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=331.78s)]
*  and the regulations that is supposed to, to respect within the European union and NATO. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=342.9s)]
*  And last but not least, he's very much against Romania being a NATO member and paying its share [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=350.65999999999997s)]
*  of duties towards this organization. More on that in a moment. But just, you know, unlike many [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=360.9s)]
*  countries, people will be looking at Romania and saying, this is a country that has so far [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=370.58s)]
*  resisted some of these nationalist appeals that you describe Mr. Gheorgheczu as, as having. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=376.26s)]
*  What's changed? Yes and no. Romania has been resisting extreme populism, like the one [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=383.78s)]
*  by Mr. Gheorgheczu. However, we have to bear in mind the results of the previous two rounds of [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=394.02s)]
*  elections, the parliamentarian elections and the European elections, where the union, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=402.1s)]
*  the alliance for the union of, of Romanians that I have been mentioning before won quite a sizable [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=408.74s)]
*  number of seats, both in the national parliament and in the European parliament. So, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=417.38s)]
*  extreme right, far right movements are not something new in the Romanian political milieu. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=425.94s)]
*  They might have changed their names, but they have been existing ever since the fall of communism [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=434.34s)]
*  in December 1989. Gheorgheczu, in spite of the shock that many of the [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=442.18s)]
*  Western democratic inclined Romanian citizens think, Gheorgheczu is not something new in our [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=451.86s)]
*  political public space. And you've described his sort of pro-Russia views, how he is anti-NATO, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=461.06s)]
*  anti the European union. If he is elected in two weeks, then what would that mean for, for Romania [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=469.86s)]
*  in partnerships, international partnerships like the European union and NATO? Well, let's remember [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=478.1s)]
*  that in the meantime, we have parliamentarian elections. So, because we have three rounds of [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=485.38s)]
*  consecutive elections, that would be something extremely bad and dangerous for the position that [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=490.98s)]
*  Romania is holding right now, especially since we are one of the countries that has [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=498.82s)]
*  the longest borders with Ukraine. So, first of all, that would mean the unconditional [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=505.38s)]
*  support that the Romanian state and Romanian government have been providing to Ukraine. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=512.9s)]
*  This is the first thing that we thought of in the long term, a potential Gheorgheczu's election as [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=521.3000000000001s)]
*  the president of Romania would probably mean a complete resetting of the whole political system. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=529.94s)]
*  We don't know exactly what to expect if we are to take seriously the kind of messages that he has [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=538.98s)]
*  been spreading in the last two months. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=547.38s)]
*  In favor of Nazis in World War II and he's like a f***ing serial anti-vaxxer, seems like Romania is [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=550.5s)]
*  getting a healthy dose of Americanism, baby. Oh, he praised the house orchestrators. Jesus Christ, dude. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=557.7s)]
*  He literally called Ion Antonescu, the prime minister of Romania during the national hero. Jesus Christ. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=566.1800000000001s)]
*  Two months on certain social networks, that would probably mean getting much closer to Kremlin that [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=574.18s)]
*  many of the Romanian citizens would like or even believe in. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=584.42s)]
*  Oh my God, Robert F. Kennedy will go to Romania. I don't know. Movers and shakers on the leftist side [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=595.54s)]
*  have been wiped clean by, in many instances, NATO. I can't speak for Romania specifically, but [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=600.98s)]
*  that's usually how it worked in Western Europe. And with centrist center-right parties constantly [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=609.62s)]
*  caving in, capitulating to right-wing framing on issues in a desperate attempt to maintain [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=616.02s)]
*  neoliberalism, you end up having this resurgence of fascist movements because at least one party is [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=622.1800000000001s)]
*  recognizing the anger that people have. The other party is saying, no, you need to shut the [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=629.38s)]
*  f*** up about this anger. Neo-legionariesm is a neo-fascist movement in Romania that emerged [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=633.86s)]
*  in the 1990s following the fall of communism in the country. It is endorsed by a series of [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=638.42s)]
*  organizations that claim to be the successors of the Iron Guard, whose followers were known as [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=641.78s)]
*  Legionnaires, founded by Cornelia Zelenscu-Codronao in 1927. Its main characteristics include [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=644.9s)]
*  anti-Semitism, Eastern orthodoxy, ethnic nationalism, and mysticism. There's a unique [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=651.38s)]
*  situation. Literally nobody knew who he is. He appeared overnight, Russian interference, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=655.38s)]
*  likely. Isn't this what happened in Moldova too? Moldova, Mama Liga, where the f*** you at? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=660.34s)]
*  Georgia has moved in the direction of having pro-Russian or Russian sympathetic leadership. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=665.7s)]
*  Moldova has had a similar movement and now Romania is undergoing the Moldova's pro-Russia guy loss. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=671.62s)]
*  Sorry. And again, a lot of people are shocked because half of them have zero clue about this [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=680.98s)]
*  guy. He apparently rose up in like the last month. This makes the hard right guy Romanians were scared [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=684.98s)]
*  of look like a lib. My family and I were watching the elections. Romanians are typically very [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=689.94s)]
*  patriotic. My parents grew up in the Eastern block area and saw the revolution's take down [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=694.4200000000001s)]
*  Cokes Co. My dad was like the Romanian people have woken up and finally chosen an independent. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=697.94s)]
*  And then I had to talk to him about how this guy advocated for the Legionary Romanian officials as [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=703.46s)]
*  martyrs fighting for the country. He had like a very nationalistic idea of some of those people [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=707.14s)]
*  he was condoning and he wasn't fully aware of the genocide. Romanians have a lot of historical [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=711.86s)]
*  heroes that were conservative and Ceaușescu. Ceaușescu. Ceaușescu. The nationalism is similar [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=717.62s)]
*  to the U.S. My dad thought that independent rising up would be good and didn't understand [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=725.0600000000001s)]
*  that this guy idolized the genocide of Legionaries from the 1930s. They have a very rose-colored [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=728.82s)]
*  glasses perspective on anyone who contributed to the creation of Romania, even dating back to [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=734.02s)]
*  raising the brutal Roman conquest of the Dacians. A lot of old literature is also very nationalistic [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=737.46s)]
*  and populist. Yeah, he advocated for the guy who was directly responsible for the wiping of the [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=742.02s)]
*  Jewish population even before the Nazis collaborated with them. He wrote part of in one of the RFK [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=745.78s)]

*  Mr. Gheorghescu ran a Romania first campaign. He has openly praised Russian president Vladimir Putin, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=884.58s)]
*  is a critic of NATO and has called for an end to aid to Ukraine. He left the country's far right [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=891.5400000000001s)]
*  party after they criticized his pro-Russian anti-NATO stance and has been called out for [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=899.38s)]
*  describing a Romanian world war two pro-Nazi leader as a national hero. With the country [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=905.14s)]
*  facing economic hardship, the vote is seen as a rejection of the status quo, a disquiet Gheorghescu [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=911.22s)]
*  has capitalized on. The economic insecurity imposed on the Romanian people for 35 years [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=917.38s)]
*  turned into insecurity for the political parties. The Romanian people cried peace [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=926.26s)]
*  and they cried out loud. With no candidates securing 50% of the vote, he will now face the [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=931.06s)]
*  liberal leader Elena Laskoni in a runoff in two weeks time. Well we can talk now to Sir Tony [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=937.06s)]
*  Brenton who's a former ambassador to Russia. If you're sitting in Ukraine, are you looking [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=943.14s)]
*  at the ground around you and thinking it's not as firm as you thought? Well yes, certainly. I mean [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=948.42s)]
*  the war doesn't seem to be going very well for them. The election of Trump has been presented [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=953.9399999999999s)]
*  as a disaster, it's not entirely clear but it may be. Hello, Ewers. And you've just pointed to [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=958.74s)]
*  this election in Romania which actually succeeds the rise of the far right in a fair number of [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=963.0600000000001s)]
*  EU countries and the far right in general is much more sympathetic to Russia than to Ukraine. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=968.58s)]
*  So any idea that were America to carry through with any sort of threat to scale down its support [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=975.86s)]
*  for Ukraine would result in Europe stepping into the breach. It's looking a lot less certain, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=982.9s)]
*  isn't it? That's a very good question and I think European leaders are discussing it rather intensely [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=988.98s)]
*  at the moment and the question is can they have the adequate force to fill a US size gap and support [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=994.9s)]
*  for Ukraine and even if they have, can they coordinate adequately to do it? I don't know [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=1003.14s)]
*  the answer to that question. I detect a lot of anxiety on the part of everybody. The talks [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=1011.06s)]
*  between France and the UK yesterday were an illustration of determination to least test out [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=1014.9799999999999s)]
*  the possibility. If, can you sort of interpret the British position for us for a moment? I mean is it [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=1021.9399999999999s)]
*  as straightforward as it seems? Does your stance on Russia make you far right? What's my stance on [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=1027.78s)]
*  Russia that would make me far right? I don't think my stance on Russia is similar to any number of [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=1034.4199999999998s)]
*  these different ghouls and goblins. The problem is a lot of people that are pro-Russia are not [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=1039.06s)]
*  going to openly state that they're pro-Russia because you know then a lot of people are going [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=1044.5s)]
*  to be like what the fuck are you saying? But that's politicians in general. They're not going to [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=1048.58s)]
*  fucking openly admit their desires. No politician is going to be like we want to kill the poor, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=1052.4199999999998s)]
*  you know. They're going to say no we want to democratize or liberalize our economy. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=1057.46s)]
*  We need to cut the red tape and deregulate. That Britain will support Ukraine to the end and [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=1062.02s)]
*  believes that Ukraine should fight its way to victory. Yes I think it is. We were in the lead [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=1067.14s)]
*  when the war started. We've been in the lead in getting the EU and the wider west to supply [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=1073.8600000000001s)]
*  Ukraine with weapons and all the rest of it. I think British ministers and the British establishment [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=1079.6200000000001s)]
*  rather pride themselves on the role that we've played. The downside is that we are now very high [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=1084.18s)]
*  on Russia's list of number one enemies. For example this unfortunate man James Anderson who's [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=1091.86s)]
*  just fallen into Russian hands. We have rather limited means to get him out and there must be [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=1098.34s)]
*  a certain amount of pessimism. Frankly as I watch the atmosphere which I do quite closely here, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=1104.58s)]
*  I watch the number of distinguished commentators like Lord Danit move away from the flat position. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=1110.4199999999998s)]
*  We must back Ukraine. Is the UK an exception to the far-right swing? Fuck no. The UK is exactly [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=1115.62s)]
*  the same method. The UK has a completely captive right-wing labor leadership now that is creating [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=1121.22s)]
*  the perfect conditions for the reform party just like out and about fascists to take over [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=1130.26s)]
*  next time elections are held. You'll see it's like every single one of these countries are basically [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=1136.26s)]
*  trying to extend the reign of center-right neoliberalism to the best of their ability. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=1143.6200000000001s)]
*  And if they do not it's so funny because every EU chatter a couple years back used to always joke [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=1150.66s)]
*  and be like oh we're watching America fall apart haha and I kept telling them like [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=1156.5800000000002s)]
*  motherfucker this shit's about to destroy this shit is about to in a couple years absolutely [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=1161.0600000000002s)]
*  destroy the European Union. I kept saying it over and over again. I was like bro what's happening [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=1166.66s)]
*  here in America? Like last election cycle a shit ton of EU chatters would like always be like man [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=1171.78s)]
*  your country is sure surely a clown show and I was like bro I'm telling you it's gonna happen to [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=1176.74s)]
*  you too. At that point the nascent AFD and Le Pen's like popularity was only beginning. Look at them [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=1182.02s)]
*  now and it's not just like Le Pen herself it's the movement that she represents. A serious training [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=1190.34s)]
*  role to make a huge amount of difference now. My instinct is that we are on the route towards [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=1197.46s)]
*  negotiations. It's pretty clear the sort of landing area that there's... But even if even [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=1203.38s)]
*  if Le Pen goes to prison it still doesn't change much. ...reconciliations are going to be pointing [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=1209.38s)]
*  towards which include Ukrainian territorial concessions and if Trump places cards right [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=1213.6200000000001s)]

*  Biden has solidly backed for the last two and a half years and will feel pretty good about [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=1227.62s)]
*  himself. Now the trick however is to do that without completely abandoning Ukraine. The way [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=1233.06s)]
*  things are going Ukraine will come out of this yes perhaps having agreed to an on the on the [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=1240.82s)]

*  concede it and leaves Ukraine you know feeling rather bruised by it all but also leaves Ukraine [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=1251.38s)]
*  as a western oriented state linked to the west prospects not immediately but in the longer term [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_mw24L8ao&t=1259.7800000000002s)]
