# Mark Robinson DENIES The Allegations | Hasanabi React
**HasanAbi:** [September 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ)
*  Dude, it's so funny that he said, I think you're better than Martin Luther King and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Mark Robinson took that as a diss dude. And that didn't ring any alarm bells in Trump's [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=5.26s)]
*  head so much so that he repeated that experience that he had publicly. These guys are so goddamn [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=12.08s)]
*  removed from reality. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=20.76s)]
*  We're gonna go to North Carolina, the Republican candidate for governor there under fire for [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=22.44s)]
*  disturbing comments. He reportedly made on a website's message board. Rachel Scott is [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=30.8s)]
*  tracking the story. Good morning, Rachel. George, good morning to you. And it's not [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=34.56s)]
*  just the governor's race that's important in North Carolina. It's also a critical battleground [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=37.36s)]
*  state in presidential politics to early voting in that state begins today. And Mark Robinson [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=41.8s)]
*  has made it clear his name is staying on the ballot. This morning, Mark Robinson, the Republican [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=46.72s)]
*  nominee for governor and the critical swing state of North Carolina is vowing to stay [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=51.96s)]
*  in the race. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=56.52s)]
*  Gluon, Gluon platoon commander, Mark Robinson signing up for duty, sir. Okay. He's here [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=57.52s)]
*  and he's ready to go. He's ready to let it rip. Now we covered Mark Robinson quite extensively [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=65.92s)]
*  a fantastic character in the, the American political mosaic. Okay. He is a man with many [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=73.2s)]
*  interests. Okay. And just like Ryan Ruth, I consider to be a go-getter. I would say [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=83.08s)]
*  Mark Robinson has that same intensity, but for things he likes. Okay. For Ryan Ruth, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=88.62s)]
*  defending Ukraine. Okay. For Mark Robinson, that is gooning. He is a gooner through and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  through. I would say that he is the gooner as a matter of fact, more so than any other [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=104.60000000000001s)]
*  gooner I have ever encountered in my life. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=110.56s)]
*  He, he really put a lot of, like, I think this man is, is motivated by gooning more [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=113.64000000000001s)]
*  than the average person is. I'll say it like that. Okay. He seemingly is, is perhaps a [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=119.2s)]
*  little bit too invested in the goon. If that makes sense. I'm ordering food for myself [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  because I know I'm not going to have any time to eat between now and like 7 P.M. And I'll [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=132.76s)]
*  die. So I'm trying to order some food as quickly as I possibly can. Oh, this is wrong. I don't [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=137.88s)]
*  want this anyway. Bro was probably a Diddy's freak offs. No, he was a two working class [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=144.88s)]
*  to participate in Diddy's freak offs. And that is unfortunately for him. I mean, or [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=150.92s)]
*  I guess fortunately he could not participate in Diddy freak offs, but he would have if [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=157.0s)]
*  he had the opportunity, 100% that much is clear to me. Okay. Broad daylight clarity, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=162.76s)]
*  the clarity that he never really demonstrated in his entire life. If we're being real, this [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=169.83999999999997s)]
*  man, as this man personally spent an unimaginable amount of time in his life, not only gooning, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=173.96s)]
*  but thinking about gooning, writing about gooning and also being a Nazi. It was fantastic. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  The coverage on it was fantastic. Shouts out the K file. Once again, for that, he went [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=192.36s)]
*  into debt for how hard he gooned. And I think many of you do not have that level of inspiration [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=196.92000000000002s)]
*  investment and many of you do not have that level of, of resilience. Many of you would [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=203.96s)]
*  never go that hard. He did. He did. And I can't help but respect them for hit. Okay. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=212.72s)]
*  You need to upload a YouTube video on it. I want to send them my friends. I'm shocked [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=219.60000000000002s)]
*  that my editors have not made this already. If we're being honest, I thought that it would [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=222.60000000000002s)]
*  have been out by now. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=226.92000000000002s)]
*  Don, he made the series of an inflammatory online posts that are detailed in an explosive [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  new CNN report, including one where he reportedly called himself a quote, black Nazi. Let me [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=232.96s)]
*  reassure you the things that you will see in that story. Those are not the words of [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=238.84s)]
*  Mark Robinson. ABC news has not independently confirmed the reporting. CNN says Robinson, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=244.16s)]
*  the state's current Lieutenant governor, made the comments between 2008 and 2012 on a website [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=249.24s)]
*  called Africa, including allegedly saying that slavery is not bad, adding he wished it [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=254.76000000000002s)]
*  would come back and describing in graphic details, spying on women in public showers [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=260.8s)]
*  as a teenager. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=264.96000000000004s)]
*  Robinson is no stranger to controversy. He has a history of inflammatory rhetoric, but [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=266.64000000000004s)]
*  he won the Republican primary. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=271.24s)]
*  All goon, some Mark goon, all the few, the proud, the gooner respect gooning, ain't it [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=273.12s)]
*  being a Nazi. However it is. I'll be honest with you, according to the Republican party [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=280.12s)]
*  and the way that they've received this story, being a Nazi is a significantly lower than [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=285.36s)]
*  gooning. Like they literally, they are embarrassed about the stuff, but they don't give up about [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=290.68s)]
*  him being like, he didn't say any of those things. Wait, what? Yes, he did. The funniest [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=298.28000000000003s)]
*  part about this story is that he very publicly has said things like this. Like there was [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=303.6s)]
*  already public information. Oh, freaky Robinson did though. Yeah. So the funniest aspect of [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=308.32s)]
*  this story is that a lot of this stuff was readily available. Like we knew that he had, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=315.12s)]
*  you know, quoted Adolf on his Facebook page and defended quoting Adolf on his Facebook [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=321.12s)]
*  page. He quoted him in 2014 and defended quoting him in 2021. We knew that he had a gooning [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=325.84s)]
*  habit because the owner of the store that he routinely frequented came out with an expose [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=331.76s)]
*  being like, yeah, this dude literally owes me money. He made a song about it. We covered [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=337.44s)]
*  all of it. Right. But what we didn't know was the extent of the gooning. I guess we [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=341.76000000000005s)]
*  didn't know the extent of him being an open overt Nazi who hated MLK, even though we kind [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=347.12s)]
*  of knew he hated MLK as well, at least Trump did because Trump actually brought that exact [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=354.12s)]
*  same thing up a while ago when endorsing Mark Robinson, where he's like, I called him MLK. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=359.24s)]
*  He didn't like it. I don't know why. I don't know why he didn't like being called MLK, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=365.04s)]
*  but he's MLK on steroids. Like he literally said that. Okay. So, you know, that's Mark [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=371.91999999999996s)]
*  Robinson for you listening to this conversation with no context, never give me the hint that [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=378.35999999999996s)]
*  it's about politics. Holy. It's not only just about politics, but this is already an elected [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=382.0s)]
*  lieutenant governor. He is the sitting lieutenant governor of North Carolina chat. This person [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=386.35999999999996s)]
*  already has been elected in the office and now he's running for the top position. He's [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=392.76s)]
*  running in the gubernatorial race. He's running for governor against Josh Stein, the Democratic [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=397.28000000000003s)]
*  candidate. The story is amazing because it's so funny, but it's like, it's just a reiteration [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=401.76s)]
*  of the things we knew about him already. It's just like further evidence of the things that [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=409.32s)]
*  we knew already. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=413.2s)]
*  It was endorsement. This is Martin Luther King on steroids. Okay. Now I told that I [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=414.2s)]
*  told that I told that to Mark, I'm a Lebanese civilian. All I have to say is that us civilians, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=421.04s)]
*  we are paying the price of Hezbollah playing around with Israel. He started it by helping [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=427.16s)]
*  him, which I'm not saying is something bad, but for us it is because we are the one paying [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=431.32000000000005s)]
*  the price of something we weren't even supposed to get involved with. The last time they invaded [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=435.08000000000004s)]
*  was the same problem. That's really interesting that you say that Lebanese civilian because [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=438.8s)]
*  Hezbollah didn't even exist before Israel invaded Lebanon. And you know, you're putting [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=443.6s)]
*  the cart before the horse a little bit, at least historically speaking, because back [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=449.12s)]
*  then you were paying the price of having Palestinian refugees living inside of your boundaries. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=454.90000000000003s)]
*  But the reality of the matter is they would have invaded anyway. Okay. They want it. That's [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=460.1s)]
*  it. You got it. They want it. That's, that's gonna happen. Okay. That's going to happen [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=463.7s)]
*  no matter what. So whether you have some kind of resistance force against it or not doesn't [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=468.82s)]
*  change the reality that it is going to happen. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=475.34000000000003s)]
*  I said, I think you're better than Martin Luther King. I think you are Martin Luther [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=477.86s)]
*  King times two CNN reports that allegedly in some online posts, Robinson actually attacked [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=483.86s)]
*  the slain civil rights hero, Martin Luther King Jr., calling him a communist and using [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=489.78000000000003s)]
*  a racial slur. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=494.04s)]
*  I actually exposed my mom to Kufi and Hagee, the thing how he went to the DC rally recently. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=495.86s)]
*  I posted Christian Zionism is anti-Semitism. She asked me to explain, I explained the whole [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=500.66s)]
*  Megiddo thing. She was mad about how anti-Semitic it was. I then said that exactly why Israel [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=503.78000000000003s)]
*  and Judaism are different. These freaks are pro Holocaust too. And also pro Israel. That's [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=509.06s)]
*  where she ended the combo and asked to stop. That's good. You know, you got to keep pushing [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=513.34s)]
*  for all the Jewish Hassan Abiyeds in the chat. You just got to keep pushing in the, in your, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=518.1s)]
*  in your, you know, real life with people that love you that are willing to listen to you. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=522.34s)]
*  The North Carolina Republican party is standing by their candidate for governor calling the [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=528.7s)]
*  allegations against Robinson a political smear. But the Harris campaign pouncing quick to [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=532.78s)]
*  highlight Trump and Robinson together. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=537.98s)]
*  Let me tell you about my best friend. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=540.42s)]
*  Polls have Vice President Kamala Harris and Donald Trump neck and neck in North Carolina. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=543.38s)]
*  The Trump campaign responding to this news in a statement calls North Carolina vital [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=547.86s)]
*  to their chances of winning the White House in November. That statement does notably not [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=551.8199999999999s)]
*  mention Mark Robinson by name. And this morning there is no word whether Robinson will appear [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=556.1s)]
*  with the former president at that rally in North Carolina this weekend. George. Okay, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=560.46s)]
*  Rachel, thank you. And he's been an unbelievable lieutenant governor, Mark Robinson. For me, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=564.3000000000001s)]
*  there is no compromise on abortion. I think you're better than the pass the bill. So you [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=570.4200000000001s)]
*  can't have them, dude. It's so funny that he said, I think you're better than Martin [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=574.82s)]
*  Luther King. And Mark Robinson took that as a diss dude. And that didn't ring any alarm [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=579.58s)]
*  bells in Trump's head. So much so that he repeated that experience that he had publicly. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=586.66s)]
*  These guys are so goddamn removed from reality, like the way MLK is perceived by even white [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=594.1s)]
*  Americans, unless they are the most right. Like most people think that's good. He's a [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=602.1s)]
*  good guy. He did good things. Okay. You have to be the most delusional person to look at [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=606.5s)]
*  a story like that. Have a guy, a black dude be like, Oh, I take offense to you. Compare [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=612.98s)]
*  me to MLK. He's a godless commie bastard or whatever the, and then turning around and [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=618.74s)]
*  like repeating parts of that story. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=624.1800000000001s)]
*  Like that should have been your first red flag, but Trump is so goddamn invested in [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=626.86s)]
*  like anyone that turns around and says, I love you, sir. I love you more than life itself [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=632.1400000000001s)]
*  that he has no way of analyzing the situation beyond the immediate feedback that he's getting [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=638.5s)]
*  from his sick offense. This is the reason why his political instincts are bunk. This [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=646.46s)]
*  is the reason why his political instincts are broken. This is the reason why he's locked [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=651.62s)]
*  in with psychos like this. Okay. I hate how Islamophobic most people around me, the Netherlands [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=655.66s)]
*  are including my own damn family. They don't understand how a queer trans woman can support [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=662.3s)]
*  Palestine. It's fine. People have been saying this as should have been more of the recent [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=665.58s)]
*  revelations, but I think this one is fine because you can't really say it's mudslinging. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=670.38s)]
*  It's clearly just policy oriented. The other stuff can be kept for ads for the actual governor [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=673.5600000000001s)]
*  raise. Yeah. I mean, he's like bad above board. I would have probably posted a little bit [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=677.58s)]
*  more about the MLK [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=682.5400000000001s)]
*  I'm pushing the North Carolina for any reason abortion in this country. It's about the child [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=683.5400000000001s)]
*  because you aren't responsible enough to keep your skirt down. I've been with him a lot. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=688.74s)]
*  I've gotten to know him and he's outstanding. Donald Trump and Mark Robinson. They're both [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=693.58s)]
*  wrong for North Carolina. I'm Kamala Harris and I approve this message. Yeah. I mean, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=698.34s)]
*  that's like everyone who isn't a bloodless ghoul likes MLK. Hating him is like coming [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=703.5s)]
*  out and saying you hate Mr. Rogers and Jesus. Yeah. Like given the whitewashed way that [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=707.2800000000001s)]
*  people represent the civil rights movement and the way that they like talk about MLK [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=712.98s)]
*  as like the acceptable figurehead, like liberals and Republicans alike concede that MLK was [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=716.98s)]
*  a good guy in some ways, the unhinged MLK haters on the right are more honest about [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=723.46s)]
*  his background. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=728.62s)]
*  I would say for the wrong reasons, right? Well, you got the FBI celebrating MLK man. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=729.62s)]
*  Come on. They literally they may or may not have him. Okay. They certainly were not fond [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=736.02s)]
*  of him. They objectively were trying to get him to himself by blackmailing him and, and [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=741.62s)]
*  complete surveillance to the best of their technological ability at the time. And even [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=749.86s)]
*  the FBI comes out and is like, we love MLK every year. So, you know, that's, that's what [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=755.1s)]
*  you need to understand. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=761.0600000000001s)]
*  I'm okay. History is one revision away from saying they figured out through an ice cream [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=762.0600000000001s)]
*  social. Yeah. Yeah. I saw that Republicans are trying to make Nebraska winner take all [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=766.0600000000001s)]
*  Senator Lindsey Graham skip votes yesterday to go to Nebraska and urge lawmakers there [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=771.42s)]
*  to switch the estate, switch the state's electoral college vote allotment to winner take all [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=774.7s)]
*  this is a, this I think is just desperation for the record from, from the Republicans [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=779.82s)]
*  once again, they're trying to pick up like, like they're trying to pick up any kind of, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=785.34s)]
*  any kind of support they possibly can. Okay. Is North Carolina in play? I mean, look, I [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=790.6600000000001s)]
*  look at the down ballot races and a lot of these places and like a lot of the senators [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=797.4200000000001s)]
*  are in a similar boat to Mark Robinson where they're like running against like first timers [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=801.38s)]
*  a lot of the senators that are in the down ballot races as it stands currently are going [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=808.74s)]
*  up against objectively bad Republican candidates. Okay. And for that reason, they're outperforming [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=815.86s)]
*  the top of the ticket by like sometimes 10 points even, well, not 10 points, but like [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=822.98s)]
*  usually around like 5.6 points, which is pretty significant. Right. And so I don't know what [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=827.54s)]
*  kind of implications this has on the top of the ticket in North Carolina, as it seemingly has had [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=835.62s)]
*  no positive impact on the top of the ticket in other races around the country. So we shall see, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=842.0999999999999s)]
*  especially when the governor race like gubernatorial races are notoriously anti-partisan. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=849.06s)]
*  It's a very personal thing for people. They, they know that people know that like their governor [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=855.86s)]
*  impacts their lives pretty significantly. That's also part of the reason why you have, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=862.26s)]
*  you know, more moderate governors that are still Republican in places like Ohio that are [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=866.58s)]
*  significantly more right-wing or you have someone like Andy Bashar in Kentucky. It's like plus 35 [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=870.74s)]
*  red state. Andy Bashar is a Democrat and a progressive Democrat as a matter of fact, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=877.62s)]
*  and is also one of the most popular governors historically, one of the most popular governors [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=881.86s)]
*  in the nation. So obviously, you know, people analyze the governor's race very differently [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=887.38s)]
*  than they analyze like the presidential race or even their, their Senate races and their races [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=895.3s)]
*  in their districts. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmVBaIwBKQ&t=901.14s)]
