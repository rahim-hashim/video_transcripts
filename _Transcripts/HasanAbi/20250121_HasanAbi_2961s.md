# Trump Loses Control At First White House Briefing | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0)
*  I'm sort of on both sides of the argument. But what I really do [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=0.0s)]
*  feel is that we have to let really competent people great [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2.66s)]
*  people famously there are there aren't matri days in the United [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=6.12s)]
*  States of America. In Somalia, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=9.72s)]
*  sooner on USMCA. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=15.96s)]
*  My man said I use H1B visas for my waiter staff, dude. That's [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=19.44s)]
*  crazy. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=24.0s)]
*  Both of them in Canada very much so. They've allowed millions [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=25.28s)]
*  in. Anyway, Trump is this investment coming into our [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=29.22s)]
*  country. Let's see what he has to say about AI shit. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=36.9s)]
*  Really the fact that I won the race and that they feel [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=39.3s)]
*  confident in their investments. And it's big money and high [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=43.22s)]
*  quality people. So my first day back from from having a nice [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=46.82s)]
*  life. It's my honor to welcome three of the world's leading [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=52.620000000000005s)]
*  technology CEOs and in the case of Larry Larry Ellison, it's [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=56.62s)]
*  well beyond technology sort of CEO of everything. He's an [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=62.099999999999994s)]
*  amazing man, amazing business person. But to announce the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=67.02s)]
*  largest AI infrastructure project by far in history, and [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=72.17999999999999s)]
*  it's all taking place right here in America. As you know, there's [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=76.58s)]
*  great competition for AI and other things and they're coming [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=82.1s)]
*  in at the highest level. We're joined by Oracle Executive [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=87.78s)]
*  Chairman Larry Ellison, SoftBank CEO, my friend Masa, Masa Yoshi [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=91.14s)]
*  son, and CEO of Open AI. And I would say the by far the leading [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=99.38s)]
*  expert based on everything I read, Sam Altman. So that's [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=107.1s)]
*  great that you're coming in together. That's a massive group [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=111.9s)]
*  of talent and money. Together these world leading technology [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=115.54s)]
*  giants are announcing the formation of Stargate. So put [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=119.7s)]
*  that name down in your books, because I think you're going to [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=124.86000000000001s)]
*  hear a lot about it in the future. A new American company [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=127.62s)]
*  that will invest $500 billion, at least in AI infrastructure in [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=131.70000000000002s)]
*  the United States and move and very, very quickly moving very [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=136.82s)]
*  rapidly, creating over 100,000 American jobs almost immediately. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=140.58s)]
*  This monumental undertaking is a resounding declaration of [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=145.78s)]
*  confidence in America's potential under a new president. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=149.38000000000002s)]
*  Let me be a new president. I didn't say it. They did. So I [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=154.78s)]
*  appreciate that fellas, but it'll ensure the future of [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=159.42000000000002s)]
*  technology. What we want to do is we want to keep it in this [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=163.5s)]
*  country. China is a competitor and others are competitors we [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=166.06s)]
*  want. We want it to be in this country and we're making it [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=169.58s)]
*  available. I'm going to help a lot through emergency [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=173.9s)]
*  declarations because we have an emergency. We have to get this [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=178.78s)]
*  stuff built. So they have to produce a lot of electricity and [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=181.58s)]
*  we'll make it possible for them to get that production done very [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=186.46s)]
*  easily at their own plants if they want, where they'll build [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=189.78s)]
*  at the plant, the AI plant, they'll build energy generation. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=194.10000000000002s)]
*  And that will be incredible. But it's technology and artificial [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=199.17999999999998s)]
*  intelligence all made in the USA. Begin immediately Stargate [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=205.34s)]
*  will be building the physical and virtual infrastructure to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=209.82s)]
*  power the next generation of advancements in AI. And this [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=213.66s)]
*  will include the construction of colossal data centers, very, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=217.57999999999998s)]
*  very massive structures. I was in the real estate business. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=221.06s)]
*  These are big, beautiful buildings that are going to [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=225.7s)]
*  employ a lot of people. And physical campuses and locations [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=228.38s)]
*  currently being scouted nationwide. They're making their [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=232.3s)]
*  choices of locations. I think they have their choice. I'd like [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=235.06s)]
*  to ask Larry, Sam and Masa to say a few words and just talk [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=239.14s)]
*  about a little bit about what they're doing. And if you have [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=245.14s)]
*  any questions, and then we'll go into a couple of other subjects [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=248.57999999999998s)]
*  also. But this is to me a very big thing. $500 billion Stargate [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=251.57999999999998s)]
*  project. I think it's going to be something that's very [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=257.82s)]
*  special. It'll lead to something that could be the biggest of [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=260.18s)]
*  all. So Larry, maybe we'll start with you and we'll go down the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=263.53999999999996s)]
*  line. Thank you. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=268.3s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. We certainly couldn't do this [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=274.58s)]
*  without you. It would simply be impossible. AI holds incredible [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=276.7s)]
*  promise for all of us, for every American. We've actually been [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=282.62s)]
*  working with OpenAI for a while and with Masa for a while. The [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=287.94s)]
*  data centers are actually under construction. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=291.78s)]
*  On the one hand, I think the AI stuff is already like a scam and [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=293.82s)]
*  very phony in terms of like the technological capabilities. But [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=297.21999999999997s)]
*  even if it was true, then Donald Trump is signing off on the [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=301.78s)]
*  displacement of the existing American labor force right now to [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=305.18s)]
*  the tune of billions of dollars. How does that work with the [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=308.94s)]
*  whole like I am pro labor [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=312.06s)]
*  charismatic and the ones that I think touches us all is electronic [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=313.78000000000003s)]
*  health records, not just maintaining electronic health [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=319.90000000000003s)]
*  records, but by looking at electronic health records, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=322.98s)]
*  understanding the condition of the AI is not phony, you're so [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=325.54s)]
*  high. Oh my god, sure. And being able to talk about that after [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=329.3s)]
*  that is a challenge. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=333.66s)]
*  I think we have a lot of other things that are much better than [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=334.46s)]
*  the otherwise would be a doctor in Indian River Reservation [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=337.26s)]
*  would be able to see how a doctor at Memorial Sloan Kettering [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=342.26s)]
*  would treat the patient or a doctor at Stanford would treat [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=346.74s)]
*  the patient. We actually provide all of that information, all of [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=351.86s)]
*  that guidance to the doctors, the doctors who are treating [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=355.58s)]
*  cancer patients or or patients that any other kind of disease [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=358.86s)]
*  I'm not going to take a lot of time and I'm going to pass it to [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=363.34s)]
*  Masa, but this is a very exciting program for Oracle to [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=365.58s)]
*  be a part of. Thank you. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=368.38s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=374.34s)]
*  That's good. That's great. I feel taller now. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=377.7s)]
*  Thank you. Well, Mr. President, last last month, I came to [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=384.62s)]
*  celebrate your winning and promised that we will invest 100 [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=393.02s)]
*  billion dollars. And you told me, oh, Masa, go for 200. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=397.9s)]
*  Now I came back with 500. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=404.53999999999996s)]
*  Because because this is the as you say yesterday, this is the [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=408.98s)]
*  beginning of golden age of America. This is one great [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=413.14s)]
*  example, I think. Right? We wouldn't have decided to do [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=418.98s)]
*  this. This is the beginning of golden age. We wouldn't have [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=423.3s)]
*  decided unless you won. And yesterday, we agreed we signed [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=427.21999999999997s)]
*  to make this happen. Because of this. So we would make this [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=433.14s)]
*  happen. We would immediately start deploying 100 billion [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=442.26s)]
*  dollars with the goal of making 500 billion dollars within next [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=446.1s)]
*  four years within your time. Right? Because of your success. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=451.22s)]
*  So we are very, very excited to do this. And our partners, of [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=458.02000000000004s)]
*  course, Softbank, OpenAI, Oracle, and additionally InvestMGX. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=464.58000000000004s)]
*  On top of that, we have the technology partner, NVIDIA. And [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=471.62s)]
*  of course, Microsoft has been very, very supportive to Sam and [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=477.14s)]
*  continue to support all our success. This is not just for [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=481.38s)]
*  business. As Larry said, this will help people's life. This [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=487.86s)]
*  will help solving many, many issues, difficult things that [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=493.38s)]
*  otherwise we could not have solved. With the power of AI. I [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=499.78s)]
*  think AGI is coming very, very soon. And after that, that's not [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=504.98s)]
*  the goal. After that, artificial super intelligence will come to [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=510.53999999999996s)]
*  solve the issues that mankind would never ever have thought [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=516.02s)]
*  that we could solve. Well, this is the beginning of our golden [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=521.02s)]
*  age. Thank you very much. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=527.54s)]
*  I don't have too much to add. But I do want to say I'm thrilled [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=533.5s)]
*  we get to do this in the United States of America. I think this [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=536.18s)]
*  will be the most important project of this era. And as [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=538.66s)]
*  Masa said, for AGI to get built here, to create hundreds of [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=541.4599999999999s)]
*  1000s of jobs to create a new industry centered here. We [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=544.62s)]
*  wouldn't be able to do this without you, Mr. President. And [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=548.18s)]
*  I'm thrilled that we get to. I think it'll be an exciting [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=550.4599999999999s)]
*  project. I think we'll be able to do all of the wonderful [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=553.66s)]
*  things these guys talked about. But the fact that we get to do [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=555.98s)]
*  this in the United States is is, I think, wonderful. So yeah, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=558.86s)]
*  not China very much. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=562.7s)]
*  So many positive things about what it's going to do for [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=566.14s)]
*  medical research and for solving things cancer and all [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=569.7s)]
*  the different problems. How will AI help us with the fight [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=573.14s)]
*  against my dad is walking around talking about the golden agent [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=577.26s)]

*  the work they're doing there. I think they'll jointly be some [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=584.38s)]
*  How does your dad foresee making money off of AI? Just try to [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=587.02s)]
*  get him to walk from step A to step B. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=591.9s)]
*  unprecedented rate. We will be amazed at how quickly we're [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=594.62s)]
*  curing this cancer and that one and heart disease. And what this [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=598.02s)]
*  will do for the ability of to deliver very high quality [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=601.58s)]
*  healthcare that costs but really to cure the diseases at a rapid [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=605.58s)]
*  rapid rate, I think will be among the most important things [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=609.54s)]
*  this technology does. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=613.38s)]
*  So we're currently working on. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=620.62s)]
*  Try step on this. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=623.06s)]
*  All right. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=624.3s)]
*  No, no, no, I'm not. I'm not that I'm not that I'm not that [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=626.3s)]
*  tall. I'm not. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=629.7s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. One of the most exciting things we're [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=634.3s)]
*  working on you again using the tools that that salmon Moss are [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=637.34s)]
*  providing is our cancer vaccine. It's very interesting. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=641.34s)]
*  Early diet. It turns out I'll be quick. All of our cancers, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=647.1800000000001s)]
*  cancer tumors, little fragments of those tumors float around in [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=652.38s)]
*  your blood. So you can do early cancer detection if you can do [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=656.7s)]
*  using AI. You can do early cancer detection with a blood [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=660.98s)]
*  test. And using AI to look at the blood test, you can find a [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=664.62s)]
*  cancer seriously threatening the person so we can again, cancer [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=672.78s)]
*  cancer diagnosis using AI as the promise of just being a simple [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=676.86s)]
*  blood test. Then beyond that, once we gene sequence once we [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=680.7s)]
*  gene sequence that cancer tumor, you can then vaccinate the [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=686.66s)]
*  person, design a vaccine for every individual person to [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=691.54s)]
*  vaccinate them against that cancer. And you can make that [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=696.94s)]
*  activated the trigger where are in a vaccine. You can make that [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=701.5s)]
*  robotically again, using AI and about 48 hours. So imagine early [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=706.34s)]
*  cancer detection, the development of a cancer vaccine [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=710.74s)]
*  for the for your particular cancer aimed at you and have have [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=714.38s)]
*  that vaccine available in 48 hours. This is the promise of AI [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=718.3s)]
*  and the promise of the future. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=722.22s)]
*  Why did he say that? Why did he say that? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=725.3s)]
*  Yeah, just one second. We'll finish up. But you know, these [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=732.22s)]
*  are highly respected guys. I was shocked with Larry because I [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=736.1s)]
*  don't even think Larry does this stuff. He did a very good job [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=739.58s)]
*  for a guy that doesn't do it much, right. But he's so [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=742.5s)]
*  respected and the group and it's it's really an honor. But for [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=745.3399999999999s)]
*  Larry to be here and do this is very unusual because he doesn't [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=751.78s)]
*  do this stuff. He doesn't need it. And you don't need it. Do [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=754.9s)]
*  you? You don't need it. But I just I think it's an honor to [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=758.38s)]
*  the to the country. It's a great honor that this group where [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=763.5s)]
*  these are the top people that they they're going to do it and [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=767.38s)]
*  they're going to do it here and we're going to make it as easy [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=773.78s)]
*  as it can be. 500 million stargate project comes in [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=776.9s)]
*  addition to a separate pledge between 100 and 200 billion [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=782.14s)]
*  dollars from as we know from Masa. We talked about before. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=786.62s)]
*  Also 20 billion from the Mac, which was great. And we have [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=792.02s)]
*  many others that are coming. Some I just say just announced [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=796.14s)]
*  that it's easier. But with some I know him and they're so [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=799.54s)]
*  highly respected. I'd rather do it this way. Many would like to [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=802.86s)]
*  do it this way. But we're letting the world know what's [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=806.46s)]
*  happening. This is money that normally would have gone to [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=810.94s)]
*  China or other countries, but in particular China in total [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=814.2600000000001s)]
*  before the end of my first full business day in Washington and [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=817.86s)]
*  the White House. We've already secured nearly three trillion [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=822.38s)]
*  dollars of new investments in the United States and probably [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=826.74s)]
*  more than a million dollars in the United States. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=830.02s)]
*  And we're going to be able to do that. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=833.0600000000001s)]
*  I think that's going to be six or seven by the end of the week. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=836.1s)]
*  Tremendous amounts of money are coming in for many things other [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=840.1s)]
*  than even AI. AI seems to be very hot. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=844.5s)]
*  It seems to be the thing that a lot of smart people are looking [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=847.5s)]
*  at very strongly. Our country will be prospering [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=851.1s)]
*  like never before. I think that's true and it's [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=854.1s)]
*  a very important day. I think it's a very [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=857.22s)]
*  important day. I think it's a very [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=860.46s)]
*  grand day of any administration and history. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=864.1s)]
*  There's never been a first day like yesterday, as you know. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=867.1s)]
*  I signed a sweeping slate of executive orders to stop the [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=870.1s)]
*  invasion of our borders. I launched a government-wide [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=874.1s)]
*  effort to defeat inflation and bring down the cost of daily [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=877.1s)]
*  life and bring down the cost of energy, magnificently bring it [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=880.1s)]
*  down. We're going to bring down the [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=884.1s)]
*  prices of food and the prices of everything else come down. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=885.1s)]
*  Energy is the big baby. And we declared a national energy [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=888.1s)]
*  emergency to drill baby drill, our term that we use. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=893.1s)]
*  We're going to drill baby drill like never before. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=896.1s)]
*  We ended destructive DEI mandates across the federal [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=899.1s)]
*  government and returned our country to a merit-based system [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=903.1s)]
*  and a common sense system. As you know, the Supreme Court [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=907.1s)]
*  gave us a decision on merit where things in this country can [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=911.1s)]
*  be based on merit now instead of a lot of different rules, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=914.1s)]
*  regulations and things that really put our country at a big [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=917.1s)]
*  disadvantage. We permanently stopped [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=920.1s)]
*  government censorship and restored free speech that was [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=922.1s)]
*  signed yesterday. We renamed the Gulf of Mexico [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=926.1s)]
*  the Gulf of America. Sounds so beautiful. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=930.1s)]
*  The Gulf of America. And returned the name of a great [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=934.1s)]
*  president, William McKinley to Mount McKinley. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=938.1s)]
*  They took off the name. And he was actually a great [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=940.1s)]
*  president. He was a very, very successful [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=944.1s)]
*  businessman. He ran for governor of Ohio. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=948.1s)]
*  He won and did a great job as governor, ran for president and [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=950.1s)]
*  he won. He was assassinated ultimately in [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=954.1s)]
*  the second term, unfortunately. But he was the tariff king. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=957.1s)]
*  And he I don't think he was as bad as I am. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=962.1s)]
*  I think I believe in him even more than him, but he believed [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=965.1s)]
*  in him very strongly. And he raised massive amounts [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=968.1s)]
*  of money. Our country was at its richest [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=971.1s)]
*  from 1870 to 1913. We had the most. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=974.1s)]
*  That was when we were the richest, relatively speaking. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=980.1s)]
*  We were the richest during that period of time. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=982.1s)]
*  That was tariffs from other countries. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=984.1s)]
*  And our administration is moving with unprecedented urgency and [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=987.1s)]
*  speed to confront every single crisis facing us. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=990.1s)]
*  And we'll get the job done. And again, I want to thank Sam and [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=994.1s)]
*  Masa and Larry for being here. It's an honor to have them. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=998.1s)]
*  And we'll take a few questions. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1001.1s)]
*  You would agree that it's never acceptable to assault a police [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1006.1s)]
*  officer, right? Sure. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1009.1s)]
*  So then if I can, among those you pardoned, DJ Rodriguez, he [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1010.1s)]
*  drove a stun gun into the neck of a D.C. police officer who was [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1013.1s)]
*  abducted by the mob that day. He later confessed on video to the [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1016.1s)]
*  FBI and pleaded guilty for his crimes. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1020.1s)]
*  Why does he deserve a pardon? Well, I don't know. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1022.1s)]
*  Is it a pardon? Because we're looking at commutes and we're [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1025.1s)]
*  looking at pardons. Okay, well, we'll take a look at everything. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1027.1s)]
*  But I can say this. Murderers today are not even charged. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1030.1s)]
*  You have murderers that aren't charged all over. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1035.1s)]
*  You take a look at what's gone on in Philadelphia, take a look at [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1039.1s)]
*  what's gone off in L.A. Where people murder people and they don't [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1042.1s)]
*  get charged. These people have already served years in prison. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1046.1s)]
*  They've served in prison for years. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1050.1s)]
*  They've served in prison for years. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1052.1s)]
*  They've served in prison for years. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1054.1s)]
*  They've served in prison for years. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1056.1s)]
*  And they've served them viciously. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1058.1s)]
*  It's a disgusting prison. It's been horrible. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1060.1s)]
*  It's inhumane. It's been a terrible, terrible thing. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1063.1s)]
*  I also say this. You go to Portland where they did [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1066.1s)]
*  where they wrapped police officers, shot police officers, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1070.1s)]
*  nothing happened to anybody. You go to Seattle where they took [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1074.1s)]
*  people to jail. You go to the city of [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1078.1s)]
*  Washington where they shot people. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1080.1s)]
*  You go also take a look at Minneapolis because I was there [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1082.1s)]
*  and I watched it. If I didn't bring in the [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1085.1s)]
*  National Guard, that city wouldn't even exist today. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1087.1s)]
*  People were killed and nobody went to jail. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1090.1s)]
*  So these people have already served a long period of time. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1093.1s)]
*  And I made a decision to give a pardon. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1096.1s)]
*  Joe Biden gave a pardon yesterday to a lot of criminals. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1098.1s)]
*  These are criminals that he gave a pardon to. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1101.1s)]
*  And you should be asking that question. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1104.1s)]
*  Why did he give a pardon to the J6 unsolic committee when they [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1106.1s)]
*  burned and destroyed all documents which showed that they [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1112.1s)]
*  did what was wrong, not me? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1117.1s)]
*  Wait a minute. Why did they give a pardon to all of his [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1119.1s)]
*  relatives, his brother who made millions of dollars to all [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1122.1s)]
*  these different people? He gave pardons. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1126.1s)]
*  That's the question you should be answering. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1129.1s)]
*  You pardon people who like bludgeoned cops. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1131.1s)]
*  You know what I mean? Listen, I'm a radical. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1134.1s)]
*  Okay. And even I think that's a little wild. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1138.1s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like that's crazy. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1142.1s)]
*  That is crazy. Like sure. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1145.1s)]
*  Liberals do overemphasize January 6 being like 9 11 2, but that's [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1148.1s)]
*  insane. That is insane. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1153.1s)]
*  So I think maybe that makes it more one sided. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1156.1s)]
*  The bandwidth that Republicans have to get away with whatever [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1161.1s)]
*  they want is endless. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1165.1s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1167.1s)]
*  Abandoned by the Democrats. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1168.1s)]
*  And I'm going to North Carolina. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1169.1s)]
*  Very importantly, first I'll be there on Friday and then I'm [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1171.1s)]
*  going from there to Los Angeles. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1174.1s)]
*  And then I'm going to Nevada and I'm really going to Nevada to [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1176.1s)]
*  thank them for the vote because we won Nevada overwhelmingly. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1181.1s)]
*  And that's usually a Democrat. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1185.1s)]
*  Not sure if you're a look at the full list, but there are [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1187.1s)]
*  people who are in the last two weeks. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1189.1s)]
*  First term that literally did massive bank fraud yet just [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1191.1s)]
*  donated to his campaign. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1193.1s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, pay for play, baby. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1194.1s)]
*  The leaders of the proud boys and the Oath Keepers were free [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1196.1s)]
*  following their pardons yesterday. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1199.1s)]
*  At the time back in 2021, you urged them to stand back and [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1202.1s)]
*  stand by. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1205.1s)]
*  Is there now a place for them in the political conversation? [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1206.1s)]
*  Well, we have to see they've been given a pardon. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1209.1s)]
*  I thought their sentences were ridiculous and excessive. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1211.1s)]
*  One of the guys took down a flag that was an anti-American [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1214.1s)]
*  flag and he was given years in jail. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1219.1s)]
*  I don't know the exact number, but he was given many years in [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1222.1s)]
*  jail. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1225.1s)]
*  I thought it was very excessive. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1226.1s)]
*  And at least the cases that we looked at, these were people [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1228.1s)]
*  that actually love our country. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1232.1s)]
*  So we thought a pardon would be appropriate. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1234.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1236.1s)]
*  Mr. President, is it also true in your conversation with [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1237.1s)]
*  Republicans today that you asked them to consider recess [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1240.1s)]
*  appointments for cabinet officials? [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1242.1s)]
*  I think, yeah, if it's needed, I don't think it's going to be [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1244.1s)]
*  needed. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1247.1s)]
*  Marco, as you know, got passed overwhelmingly with 99 to [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1248.1s)]
*  nothing, which is pretty amazing. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1253.1s)]
*  Marco is going to do a great job, Secretary of State. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1255.1s)]
*  But he just got, I guess he was the first one and just got [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1259.1s)]
*  approved. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1262.1s)]
*  That's some vote. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1263.1s)]
*  99 to nothing. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1264.1s)]
*  And the nothing was a vote that he would have gotten if we [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1265.1s)]
*  wanted to do it. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1270.1s)]
*  But you know whose vote that was? [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1271.1s)]
*  Who's doing a great job right now as Vice President? [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1273.1s)]
*  Did you also talk about some sort of a trade or a deal involving [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1276.1s)]
*  wildfire relief and extension for a debt system? [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1280.1s)]
*  What I really want to have done, I was talking about this with [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1284.1s)]
*  the guys back in the Oval Office. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1288.1s)]
*  Los Angeles has massive amounts of water available to it. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1292.1s)]
*  All they have to do is turn the valve, and that's the valve [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1296.1s)]
*  coming back from and down from the Pacific Northwest where [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1299.1s)]
*  millions of gallons of water a week and a day even, in many [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1303.1s)]
*  cases, pours into California. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1309.1s)]
*  Goes all through California down to Los Angeles, and they turned [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1313.1s)]
*  it off. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1317.1s)]
*  It's off now. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1318.1s)]
*  The valve goes, it turns toward the Pacific Ocean and all that [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1319.1s)]
*  water goes pouring into the Pacific Ocean. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1322.1s)]
*  If they did what I told them to do, they wouldn't do it because [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1325.1s)]
*  politically they didn't think it was good. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1328.1s)]
*  I think it's great politically. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1330.1s)]
*  I think they're dead politically. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1332.1s)]
*  What they've done, they've destroyed the city. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1333.1s)]
*  What they've done to that city is unbelievable. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1335.1s)]
*  The sprinklers, there are sprinklers in there like these [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1338.1s)]
*  right here that you see. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1340.1s)]
*  None of them had any water in them. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1342.1s)]
*  They didn't have any water. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1344.1s)]
*  The fire hydrants, 40% of them had no water. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1345.1s)]
*  The brush was soaked, was just dry. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1348.1s)]
*  Everything was dry. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1351.1s)]
*  The sprinklers on the lawn weren't allowed to even be used. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1352.1s)]
*  So, you know, everything was dry and it was an inferno. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1355.1s)]
*  They created an inferno. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1359.1s)]
*  So we're demanding that they turn the valve. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1360.1s)]
*  He found it out. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1362.1s)]
*  He figured it out. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1363.1s)]
*  It's because California's woke Libertard policies didn't allow [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1364.1s)]
*  for the brush to be. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1368.1s)]
*  The valve. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1370.1s)]
*  The brush in the fucking forests, dude. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1371.1s)]
*  Times the size of it. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1375.1s)]
*  It's massive. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1377.1s)]
*  The sprinklers in the forest, Chad. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1378.1s)]
*  You don't understand. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1379.1s)]
*  Los Angeles, why aren't they doing it? [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1380.1s)]
*  They either have a death wish, they're stupid, or there's [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1382.1s)]
*  something else going on that we don't understand. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1385.1s)]
*  But we want the water that they're throwing away to be used [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1388.1s)]
*  for California. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1392.1s)]
*  And that includes the farm. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1395.1s)]
*  You drive up north, you see all of the land. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1396.1s)]
*  I couldn't believe it. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1400.1s)]
*  I was with Devin Nunes when he was a congressman and some other [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1401.1s)]
*  congressman from the area and we're driving up and we're on the [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1404.1s)]
*  highway and I keep looking at these farms and the land is bone [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1408.1s)]
*  dry and then you'd see an acre, about an acre or two acres, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1412.1s)]
*  the most beautiful green plants growing in it. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1416.1s)]
*  The most beautiful, it's rich stuff. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1421.1s)]
*  And you look at the soil and it's so rich. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1425.1s)]
*  That soil is almost the equivalent to like Iowa soil. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1428.1s)]
*  It's phenomenal. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1433.1s)]
*  You know what's funny about California soil is that it [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1434.1s)]
*  actually had really dense fauna and then our irrigation for [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1436.1s)]
*  agribusiness kind of ruined it. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1440.1s)]
*  At least historically. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1443.1s)]
*  The reason you have an acre is because they say you can farm [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1444.1s)]
*  one acre but no more. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1446.1s)]
*  Which is ironic because that's what Trump wants to do further. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1447.1s)]
*  He wants to do that. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1450.1s)]
*  He wants to continue damming rivers, dude. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1451.1s)]
*  So we're going to be issuing an executive order demanding that [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1454.1s)]
*  they immediately let that water come down to through California. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1457.1s)]
*  Farmers, even people living in Beverly Hills. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1462.1s)]
*  Now those people have been a lot. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1466.1s)]
*  Welcome to an actual republic. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1467.1s)]
*  Believe it or not. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1469.1s)]
*  Cook to perfection. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1470.1s)]
*  You know they were having restrictions, Larry, you know about this. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1471.1s)]
*  They wanted to restrict you to 38 gallons of water a day. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1474.1s)]
*  That sounds like a lot but it's not. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1477.1s)]
*  When you're a rich person and you like to take a shower, 38 [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1479.1s)]
*  38 38 gallons doesn't last very long and they have all this water and [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1483.1s)]
*  it's really good water up high Pacific Northwest. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1488.1s)]
*  Some comes in from Canada. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1492.1s)]
*  A nice country, by the way, comes in from Canada and it comes all the way [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1495.1s)]
*  through California and they're restricted. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1500.1s)]
*  This is another thing that I tried to remind Democrats when they were like [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1502.1s)]
*  when they were failing to mount a solid counter to Donald Trump was like [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1507.1s)]
*  just how much he lies in general in the in the most smug asshole fashion [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1512.1s)]
*  possible and how much his fan base eats up everything he's saying like he just [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1519.1s)]
*  his starting position is just born out of nothing. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1528.1s)]
*  He'll arrive at like one minor truth in a conversation. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1531.1s)]
*  Okay, to beef up the complete unverifiable lies that he keeps pushing over [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1537.1s)]
*  and over again and then he develops entire rants off of those lies like, oh, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1543.1s)]
*  well, you know, California is doing water mismanagement, which by the way it is [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1548.1s)]
*  but not in the way that Trump thinks it is. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1554.1s)]
*  Okay, because Trump wants to do more water mismanagement. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1556.1s)]
*  Ironically enough, that's his advocacy. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1560.1s)]
*  His real advocacy is actual more water mismanagement to the tune of the what [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1563.1s)]
*  the state has done already. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1568.1s)]
*  And then and then he talks about how like the 100 mile winds are, of course, [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1572.1s)]
*  it'll never say it's climate change. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1578.1s)]
*  Right. But the 100 mile winds are a unique event and that the and that the [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1579.1s)]
*  actual vegetation was dried out because California won't I don't know use [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1584.1s)]
*  valves in its forests like what the fuck no value or has a trillion dollar [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1589.1s)]
*  value. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1594.1s)]
*  It all depends on whether or not the United States gives the permit. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1595.1s)]
*  So what I'm saying is let the United States give the house California [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1598.1s)]
*  mismanaging the water. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1601.1s)]
*  Yasha Levine has a fantastic piece on this specifically about agra agribusiness [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1602.1s)]
*  in California and the Resnick family and how they have basically bought out how [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1607.1s)]
*  they basically bought out all of the natural water supply of California in an [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1615.1s)]
*  effort to continue doing their agricultural business pistachio specifically. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1620.1s)]
*  But I think pomegranate and a couple different fruits as well and that they [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1625.1s)]
*  they virtually have an almonds they have virtually have a a monopoly on the [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1633.1s)]
*  water put in jail for five years because they went after an illegal and I guess [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1638.1s)]
*  something happened where something went wrong and they arrested a wonderful [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1643.1s)]
*  company. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1648.1s)]
*  Offices going after a criminal a rough criminal by the way and I'm actually [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1649.1s)]
*  releasing now I'm the friend of I am the friend of police more than any president [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1654.1s)]
*  that's ever. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1659.1s)]
*  Did you say I'm surprised he hasn't found a way to blame the winds on the criminal [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1660.1s)]
*  aliens. He did. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1663.1s)]
*  Didn't he. Am I crazy. Didn't he initially say that this was the work. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1664.1s)]
*  Oh no that was with the terror attack. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1668.1s)]
*  No no he that was with the with the terror attack initially in Nola. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1670.1s)]
*  He was like oh that's a that's a criminal. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1675.1s)]
*  My they've served years in jail. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1677.1s)]
*  They should not have served. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1679.1s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1681.1s)]
*  And they've served years in jail and murderers don't even go to jail in this country. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1682.1s)]
*  And we had fifteen hundred we have sixteen under review as you know we commuted about [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1688.1s)]
*  sixteen of them because it looks like they could have done things that were not [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1693.1s)]
*  not acceptable for a full pardon. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1698.1s)]
*  But these people have served years of jail and their lives have been ruined and in [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1701.1s)]
*  many and in many cases. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1704.1s)]
*  Listen to me for a second. Stop interrupting. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1706.1s)]
*  They served years in jail. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1709.1s)]
*  And if you look at the American public the American public is tired of it. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1711.1s)]
*  Take a look at the election. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1716.1s)]
*  Just look at the numbers on the election. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1718.1s)]
*  We won this election in a landslide because the American public is tired of people like [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1720.1s)]
*  you that are just one sided horrible people in terms of crime. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1726.1s)]
*  You don't talk about all the people that have been killed and what happens to those [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1730.1s)]
*  murderers murderers get no time. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1735.1s)]
*  You take a look at some of these D.A.s they go after political opponents but they don't [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1738.1s)]
*  go after people that shoot people in the street. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1743.1s)]
*  They're caught. They know where they're living. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1746.1s)]
*  They know everything. They don't even go up to pick them up anymore. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1748.1s)]
*  They just let them live there. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1750.1s)]
*  They know all about it. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1752.1s)]
*  They have their pictures. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1753.1s)]
*  They have the tape of the shooting and they don't even go up and you're talking about [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1754.1s)]
*  this. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1758.1s)]
*  No we pardoned people that were treated unbelievably well. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1759.1s)]
*  Poorly. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1764.1s)]
*  In the history of our country there's never been anything take place like this. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1765.1s)]
*  They're still looking for them but they're not looking for the murderers the people that [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1769.1s)]
*  are killing everybody. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1773.1s)]
*  We are though and we're getting them out of the country. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1774.1s)]
*  We just started that. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1777.1s)]
*  We're getting them out of the country and they're going to be gotten out of the country [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1778.1s)]
*  fast. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1781.1s)]
*  They're going to be taken out of the country illegally from jails and from prisons. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1782.1s)]
*  They killed many people. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1786.1s)]
*  Some of them killed many people. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1787.1s)]
*  About 50% of them killed more than one person. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1789.1s)]
*  They were released into our country. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1793.1s)]
*  That's what we're focused on. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1795.1s)]
*  Not the kind of nonsense you're talking about. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1796.1s)]
*  You've called for a ceasefire in Ukraine. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1798.1s)]
*  If Vladimir Putin doesn't come to the table to negotiate with you will you put additional [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1802.1s)]
*  sanctions on Russia? [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1807.1s)]
*  Sounds likely. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1808.1s)]
*  Do you think that the war should be frozen currently? [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1809.1s)]
*  The war should have never started. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1811.1s)]
*  If you had a competent president which you didn't the war wouldn't have happened. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1813.1s)]
*  The war in Ukraine would have never happened if I were president. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1817.1s)]
*  But that couldn't happen because the election was rigged. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1820.1s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1823.1s)]
*  Mr. President, there's been some debate within your orbit over whether or not to keep or [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1824.1s)]
*  eliminate H1B visas. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1827.1s)]
*  What's your position on that? [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1829.1s)]
*  Do you want to keep H1Bs or do you want to get them out? [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1830.1s)]
*  I like both sides of the argument but I also like very competent people coming into our [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1833.1s)]
*  country even if that involves them training and helping other people that may not have [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1838.1s)]
*  the qualifications they do. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1842.1s)]
*  But I don't want to stop and I'm not just talking about engineers. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1844.1s)]
*  I'm talking about people at all levels. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1848.1s)]
*  We want competent people coming into our country. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1850.1s)]
*  And HB1, I know the program very well. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1853.1s)]
*  I use the program. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1855.1s)]
*  Matridis, wine experts, even waiters, high quality waiters. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1857.1s)]
*  You've got to get the best people. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1866.1s)]
*  Now, then you go into people like Larry and he needs engineers and Masa needs and this [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1868.1s)]
*  gentleman needs engineers like nobody's ever needed engineers, right? [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1873.1s)]
*  So we have to have the quality people coming in. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1877.1s)]
*  Now, by doing that, we're expanding businesses and that takes care of everybody. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1880.1s)]
*  So I'm sort of on both sides of the argument. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1886.1s)]
*  But what I really do feel is that we have to let really competent people, great people come [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1888.1s)]
*  into our country. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1892.1s)]
*  Obviously, there aren't Matridis in the United States of America. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1893.1s)]
*  In Somalia. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1897.1s)]
*  In an effort to force negotiations sooner on USMCA. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1900.1s)]
*  No, it's really. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1904.1s)]
*  My man said I use H1B visas for my waiter staff, dude. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1905.1s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1910.1s)]
*  Both of them. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1911.1s)]
*  Canada very much so. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1913.1s)]
*  They've allowed millions and millions of people to come into our country that shouldn't be [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1914.1s)]
*  here. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1918.1s)]
*  They could have stopped them and they didn't. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1919.1s)]
*  And they've killed 300,000 people last year, my opinion, have been have been destroyed [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1921.1s)]
*  by drugs, by fentanyl. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1928.1s)]
*  This has to make people realize what these guys care. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1930.1s)]
*  Massive. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1935.1s)]
*  And what these guys want the visa program to work for, right? [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1937.1s)]
*  Like, I mean, this is a pretty pretty obvious over admission case for the rest of their [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1941.1s)]
*  lives. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1945.1s)]
*  What did he say? [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1946.1s)]
*  300,000 thought they heal. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1947.1s)]
*  They never heal. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1949.1s)]
*  They say it gets worse with time. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1950.1s)]
*  It gets worse with time. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1952.1s)]
*  They lose their boy. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1953.1s)]
*  They lose their baby. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1954.1s)]
*  They lose their their young daughter to fentanyl poisoning. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1955.1s)]
*  And I had that talk with President Xi the other day, too, of China. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1960.1s)]
*  I said we don't want that crap in our country. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1964.1s)]
*  We got to stop it. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1966.1s)]
*  I had a deal with him where he was going to give the maximum penalty, which in China is [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1967.1s)]
*  the death penalty for drug dealing. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1974.1s)]
*  And he was all said he was going to give the maximum penalty to fentanyl dealers if they [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1976.1s)]
*  send to the United States, they were going to get the death penalty. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1981.1s)]
*  He's like they can send anywhere else. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1984.1s)]
*  Of course, Biden didn't pick that up. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1985.1s)]
*  I had that deal all done. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1986.1s)]
*  It was all wrapped up. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1987.1s)]
*  We're going to have it done. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1988.1s)]
*  And then the election went, let's put it nicely, didn't go the proper way. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1990.1s)]
*  I'm doing I'm trying to be nice about it. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1996.1s)]
*  It was rigged and we had an incompetent president elected. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=1998.1s)]
*  He said the millions of immigrants from Canada that have entered illegally from [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2002.1s)]
*  a thousand people of America has been killed. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2005.1s)]
*  That penalty would be sending fentanyl to Mexico, Canada and other places. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2007.1s)]
*  How much will the tariffs on Chinese? [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2011.1s)]
*  We're thinking about that, too. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2014.1s)]
*  We're talking about a tariff of 10 percent on China based on the fact that they're sending [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2015.1s)]
*  fentanyl to Mexico and Canada. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2020.1s)]
*  How soon on those tariffs? [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2024.1s)]
*  Probably February 1st. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2026.1s)]
*  February 1st. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2028.1s)]
*  For Mexico and China, we're talking about approximately approximately 25 percent. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2030.1s)]
*  We have an update on the Gaza ceasefire. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2037.1s)]
*  Why not give the death penalty for fentanyl in the US? [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2039.1s)]
*  I'm against the death penalty. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2042.1s)]
*  But for his side of the argument, first of all, he has said he wants to do that. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2043.1s)]
*  But secondly, if you actually started killing American fentanyl dealers, you would end up [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2046.1s)]
*  realizing or even the fentanyl traffickers, you would end up killing only American citizens. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2051.1s)]
*  And his job. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2057.1s)]
*  Wait, hold on. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2058.1s)]
*  You know how that happened, right? [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2059.1s)]
*  Did you know that? [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2061.1s)]
*  Talking about Gaza. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2062.1s)]
*  When you find out, you're not going to be too happy because it was terrible. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2063.1s)]
*  But the hostages are starting to come back. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2066.1s)]
*  Oh, if I if I weren't here, they wouldn't be back ever. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2071.1s)]
*  They would have never come back. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2074.1s)]
*  They would have all died. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2075.1s)]
*  If this were done a year earlier, if Biden would have done this deal a year and a half, [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2077.1s)]
*  two years ago, or frankly, it should have never happened. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2082.1s)]
*  October 7th should have never happened. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2086.1s)]
*  No, nobody should be dead. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2088.1s)]
*  But through weakness, they allowed it to happen. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2090.1s)]
*  And then it was a disaster from there. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2092.1s)]
*  But you go back just six months ago, many of these young people were living. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2094.1s)]
*  You know, young people don't die like that. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2098.1s)]
*  They're just dying. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2100.1s)]
*  And young people aren't dying at 22 and 23 years old. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2102.1s)]
*  They don't die. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2106.1s)]
*  But now they're dying. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2107.1s)]
*  And you wonder why they're dying. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2108.1s)]
*  They're being killed. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2110.1s)]
*  And they have been killed. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2111.1s)]
*  But they say six months ago, you would have had 11 more living hostages. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2113.1s)]
*  Think of that six months ago. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2118.1s)]
*  But Biden couldn't get it done. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2120.1s)]
*  And it was only the imposition that I put on it as a deadline that got it done. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2122.1s)]
*  But it's a very sad situation. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2128.1s)]
*  It should have never happened. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2131.1s)]
*  I'll tell you two things should have never happened. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2133.1s)]
*  Three things. Inflation should have never happened. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2135.1s)]
*  It would have never happened, except for what they did to energy and their crazy spending. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2137.1s)]
*  And Ukraine would have never happened. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2141.1s)]
*  Never. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2143.1s)]
*  By the way, Russia never would have gone into Ukraine. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2145.1s)]
*  I had a very strong understanding with Putin that it would have never, ever happened. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2148.1s)]
*  He disrespected Biden. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2153.1s)]
*  Very simple. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2155.1s)]
*  He disrespects people. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2156.1s)]
*  He's smart. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2158.1s)]
*  He understands. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2159.1s)]
*  He disrespected Biden. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2160.1s)]
*  And also the Middle East would have never happened because Iran was broke. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2161.1s)]
*  They had no money. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2166.1s)]
*  They had no money for Hamas. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2167.1s)]
*  They had no money for Hezbollah. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2169.1s)]
*  It would have never happened. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2171.1s)]
*  October 7th would have never happened. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2172.1s)]
*  But it did happen. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2174.1s)]
*  So this is the cards I've been given. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2175.1s)]
*  And we're getting the hostages back. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2177.1s)]
*  That would have never happened under Biden. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2179.1s)]
*  They would have never come back. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2181.1s)]
*  They were just dying versus not that slowly. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2182.1s)]
*  They were dying or being killed. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2185.1s)]
*  But that was what was happening. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2188.1s)]
*  Are you going to keep sending weapons to Ukraine or are you going to turn off the Tapsun? [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2190.1s)]
*  Well, we're looking at that. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2196.1s)]
*  We're talking to Zelensky. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2197.1s)]
*  We're going to be talking with President Putin very soon. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2198.1s)]
*  And we'll see how it all happens. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2202.1s)]
*  We're going to look at it very soon. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2204.1s)]
*  One thing I do feel, the European Union should be paying a lot more than they're paying because under Biden, I mean, we're in there for $200 billion more. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2205.1s)]
*  Now, it affects them more than it affects us. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2214.1s)]
*  We have an ocean in between, right? [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2216.1s)]
*  Little thing called an ocean. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2218.1s)]
*  The European Union should equalize. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2220.1s)]
*  We're in there for $200 billion more than the European Union. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2224.1s)]
*  I mean, what are we, stupid? [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2227.1s)]
*  I guess the answer is yes, because they must think so. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2230.1s)]
*  But the European Union takes advantage of us tremendously on trade. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2234.1s)]
*  And they now take advantage of and always have. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2238.1s)]
*  If I didn't get involved years ago, my first term, one of the first things I noticed was that they're not paying enough. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2241.1s)]
*  They're not paying. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2249.1s)]
*  And a lot of those countries weren't even paying the NATO countries. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2250.1s)]
*  They weren't paying. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2252.1s)]
*  Only seven out of 28 were paying. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2253.1s)]
*  We were one of them. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2255.1s)]
*  And Poland was one. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2257.1s)]
*  And they had a few of them that were paying, and some were paying very proudly. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2258.1s)]
*  Usually the closer to the borderline of Russia they were, the faster they paid, okay? [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2262.1s)]
*  The ones that were further away tended not to pay so fast. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2269.1s)]
*  And one thing on that, I think they should lift their number not to 2 percent, but to 5 percent. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2273.1s)]
*  NATO should be at 5 percent, not at 2 percent. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2278.1s)]
*  2 percent is ridiculous. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2281.1s)]
*  Did you ask President Xi in your conversation about Ukraine, did you ask him to get involved in helping settle that? [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2283.1s)]
*  I did, yeah. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2289.1s)]
*  I said, you ought to get it settled, because he's not done very much on that. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2290.1s)]
*  He's got a lot of power, like we have a lot of power. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2295.1s)]
*  I said, you ought to get it settled. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2299.1s)]
*  We did discuss it. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2300.1s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2301.1s)]
*  Mr. President, you launched a crypto coin the other day. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2302.1s)]
*  Do you intend to continue to sell products that benefit yourself personally while you're president? [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2303.1s)]
*  Well, I don't know if it benefited. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2308.1s)]
*  I don't know where it is. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2309.1s)]
*  I don't know much about it other than I launched it. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2310.1s)]
*  I heard it was very successful. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2312.1s)]
*  I haven't checked it. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2314.1s)]
*  Where is it today? [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2315.1s)]
*  You made a lot of money, sir. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2316.1s)]
*  How much? [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2319.1s)]
*  Several billion dollars, it seems like, in the last several days. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2320.1s)]
*  Several billion? [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2324.1s)]
*  That's peanuts for these guys. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2325.1s)]
*  Will your name and President's address take place here as president? [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2327.1s)]
*  Yeah, he wrote me a nice letter. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2331.1s)]
*  I mean, I did open it last night. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2333.1s)]
*  And I didn't know Peter said, did you get the letter? [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2335.1s)]
*  I said, wait a minute, let's see the letter. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2340.1s)]
*  It's sort of a tradition. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2342.1s)]
*  You put it in the drawer, especially of the beautiful resolute desk, right? [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2343.1s)]
*  And I opened it, and there it was. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2347.1s)]
*  It said to number 47. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2349.1s)]
*  And it was a very nice letter. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2352.1s)]
*  I mean, I could show it because I think it was a nice letter. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2353.1s)]
*  Maybe I will. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2356.1s)]
*  Just basically, it was a little bit of an inspirational type letter. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2358.1s)]
*  I know I called you a fashion boy. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2366.1s)]
*  My bad. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2368.1s)]
*  Important, very important how important the job is. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2369.1s)]
*  But I think it was a nice letter. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2372.1s)]
*  I think I should let people see it because it was a positive for him in writing it. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2375.1s)]
*  I appreciated the letter. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2380.1s)]
*  The girls are fighting. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2381.1s)]
*  Drama. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2382.1s)]
*  And I'm going to get to the next one. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2383.1s)]
*  And then, we have another one. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2384.1s)]
*  We have one more question. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2385.1s)]
*  Were security concerns an old factor when deciding to move your inauguration into the [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2387.1s)]
*  works? [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2390.1s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2391.1s)]
*  No. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2392.1s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2393.1s)]
*  It was just cold. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2394.1s)]
*  Look, if we would have, you know, I just went out to the helicopter, right, to, we said [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2395.1s)]
*  goodbye. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2400.1s)]
*  That's a tradition. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2401.1s)]
*  As long as helicopter, before it used to be a stagecoach. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2402.1s)]
*  And then helicopters came along. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2404.1s)]
*  But that's been a tradition. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2406.1s)]
*  You go out and you do that. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2407.1s)]
*  And we stood there for 10 minutes. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2409.1s)]
*  I'll tell you what. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2411.1s)]
*  People would not have been able to get through that day. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2412.1s)]
*  That was cold. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2414.1s)]
*  It was sort of interesting. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2415.1s)]
*  Don't let the sun fool you. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2416.1s)]
*  Tell me something. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2418.1s)]
*  Sunny days can get very cold, can't they? [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2419.1s)]
*  Because that was so freezing yesterday. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2421.1s)]
*  You couldn't have gotten through it. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2424.1s)]
*  It would have been. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2425.1s)]
*  What? [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2426.1s)]
*  And the answer is no. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2427.1s)]
*  It wasn't security. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2428.1s)]
*  With that being said, I thought the Capitol, the rotunda, was beautiful. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2429.1s)]
*  72 degrees. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2435.1s)]
*  Unbelievable sound. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2437.1s)]
*  It's like being in an opera house. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2440.1s)]
*  I could see people wanting to do it there rather than outside. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2443.1s)]
*  Why did they remove John Bolton's security clearance, sir? [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2447.1s)]
*  Because I think that was enough time. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2450.1s)]
*  We take a job. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2454.1s)]
*  You take a job. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2456.1s)]
*  You want to do a job. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2457.1s)]
*  We're not going to have security on people for the rest of their lives. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2458.1s)]
*  Why should we? [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2461.1s)]
*  I thought he was a very dumb person, but I used him well because every time people saw [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2462.1s)]
*  me come into a meeting with John Bolton standing behind me, they thought that he'd attack [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2468.1s)]
*  them because he was a warmonger. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2474.1s)]
*  He's the one that got us involved along with Cheney and a couple of others convinced Bush, [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2476.1s)]
*  which was a terrible decision, to blow up the Middle East. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2481.1s)]
*  You know, we blew up the Middle East and we left. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2484.1s)]
*  Dude. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2487.1s)]
*  We got nothing out of it except a lot of death. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2488.1s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2490.1s)]
*  Killed a lot of people. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2491.1s)]
*  And John Bolton was in one of those guys. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2492.1s)]
*  Oh my God, he got a side deal with Iran to kill John Bolton. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2494.1s)]
*  John Bolton has been, has gotten assassinated. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2497.1s)]
*  President Zelensky would like to have peace. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2500.1s)]
*  He's told me that very strongly. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2503.1s)]
*  He'd like to have peace, but it takes two to tango. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2505.1s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2507.1s)]
*  When will you meet with President Putin? [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2508.1s)]
*  Anytime they want. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2510.1s)]
*  I'd like to see that end. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2511.1s)]
*  Millions of people are being killed and they're being killed. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2513.1s)]
*  It's a vicious situation. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2516.1s)]
*  And they're now largely soldiers. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2518.1s)]
*  A lot of people's lives are being killed. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2520.1s)]
*  It's a vicious situation. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2522.1s)]
*  And they're now largely soldiers. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2524.1s)]
*  A lot of people have been killed in the cities. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2526.1s)]
*  They look like demolition sites. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2529.1s)]
*  Buildings, massive buildings bombed and coming down. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2531.1s)]
*  The thing with Ukraine is that many more people died than you're reporting. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2535.1s)]
*  You're not reporting the real numbers. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2538.1s)]
*  And I'm not blaming you for that. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2540.1s)]
*  I'm blaming maybe our government for not wanting to release those numbers. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2542.1s)]
*  Many more people died than what you know about. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2545.1s)]
*  When those big buildings come down and they say two people were injured, no, no. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2548.1s)]
*  Many people, thousands of people are being killed. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2552.1s)]
*  But the people, the real killing now is on the war front. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2555.1s)]
*  It's a very flat land. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2558.1s)]
*  And the only thing that stops a bullet is somebody's body. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2560.1s)]
*  And you have young soldiers. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2564.1s)]
*  So Russia's lost about 800,000 soldiers now. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2566.1s)]
*  Ukraine's lost about 600 or 700,000. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2569.1s)]
*  I think the numbers are low that they're giving out. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2572.1s)]
*  But they've lost massive numbers of young soldiers. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2575.1s)]
*  And that war should stop. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2580.1s)]
*  It's very flat. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2583.1s)]
*  It's beautiful farmland. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2585.1s)]
*  And it's flat and really beautiful in a different kind of way. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2587.1s)]
*  But they don't have any protection. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2590.1s)]
*  The only thing that stops a bullet is a body. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2592.1s)]
*  And those bodies are stopping a lot of bullets. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2595.1s)]
*  And they're getting, they're being decimated. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2597.1s)]
*  Both sides. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2599.1s)]
*  What about your conversation with President Xi? [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2601.1s)]
*  What did you tell him in terms of when to expect tariffs? [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2604.1s)]
*  And what can he do to avoid? [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2607.1s)]
*  About which one? [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2609.1s)]
*  Tariff. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2610.1s)]
*  About tariffs? [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2611.1s)]
*  We didn't talk too much about tariffs other than he knows where I stand. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2612.1s)]
*  Look, I put large tariffs on China. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2615.1s)]
*  I've taken in hundreds of billions of dollars. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2618.1s)]
*  Until I was president, China never paid not 10 cents to the United States. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2621.1s)]
*  They paid hundreds of, 600 billion dollars or so or more. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2628.1s)]
*  More than that even. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2632.1s)]
*  Of tariffs. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2634.1s)]
*  And have a steel mill open in the United States right now. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2636.1s)]
*  You wouldn't have one steel mill open in the United States. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2640.1s)]
*  So what I did is I saved the steel industry. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2643.1s)]
*  I saved other industries too with other tariffs. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2646.1s)]
*  Other countries are big abusers also. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2652.1s)]
*  You know, it's not just China. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2655.1s)]
*  China is an abuser, but the European Union is very, very bad to us. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2657.1s)]
*  They treat us very, very badly. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2662.1s)]
*  They don't take our cars. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2664.1s)]
*  They don't take our cars at all. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2666.1s)]
*  They don't take our farm products essentially. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2668.1s)]
*  They don't take very much. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2670.1s)]
*  We have a 350 billion dollar deficit with the European Union. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2672.1s)]
*  They treat us very, very badly. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2676.1s)]
*  So they're going to be in for tariffs. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2678.1s)]
*  Mr. President. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2680.1s)]
*  It's the only way you're going to get back. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2682.1s)]
*  It's the only way you're going to get fairness. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2684.1s)]
*  You can't get fairness unless you do that. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2686.1s)]
*  But the European Union is treating us very badly. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2688.1s)]
*  I love American car manufacturers. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2690.1s)]
*  I love the labor force. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2692.1s)]
*  But our car standards are awful. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2694.1s)]
*  Yes, go ahead. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2696.1s)]
*  They're massive. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2698.1s)]
*  Why would they buy them? [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2700.1s)]
*  Because we've had stupid people doing this. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2702.1s)]
*  I'd like to have these three people negotiate for us. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2704.1s)]
*  They can't even fit in the European roads, man. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2706.1s)]
*  It would be a rich country again, but we'll be rich. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2708.1s)]
*  Mr. President. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2710.1s)]
*  Can you imagine a Humvee in an Italian road? [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2712.1s)]
*  Or an F-150? [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2714.1s)]
*  Will you rescind President Biden's executive order [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2716.1s)]
*  that opens up federal lands for data centers and energy production? [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2718.1s)]
*  No, I wouldn't do that. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2720.1s)]
*  That sounds to me like it's something that I would like. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2722.1s)]
*  I'd like to see federal lands opened up for data centers. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2724.1s)]
*  I think they're going to be very important. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2726.1s)]
*  Again, we have a lot of competition for that. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2728.1s)]
*  So it's an honor to have these three great people. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2730.1s)]
*  Because our cars are obese, too. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2732.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2734.1s)]
*  CEOs and great geniuses, all three. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2736.1s)]
*  It's an honor that they want to come out and talk to us. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2738.1s)]
*  I'm going to go to the next question. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2740.1s)]
*  It's an honor that they want to come to our country. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2742.1s)]
*  But we're going to make it as easy as we can for them. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2744.1s)]
*  Because other countries want them to. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2746.1s)]
*  I'm going to have to go now. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2748.1s)]
*  Thank you all very much. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2750.1s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2752.1s)]
*  Do you have TikTok on your phone? [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2754.1s)]
*  No, but I think I might put it there. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2756.1s)]
*  American cars are fun, though, Mr. Porsche. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2758.1s)]
*  By the way, again, we won the Young Vote. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2760.1s)]
*  I think I won it through TikTok. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2762.1s)]
*  So I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2764.1s)]
*  Okay? [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2766.1s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2768.1s)]
*  I think the UAW is fantastic. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2770.1s)]
*  And I would love... [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2774.1s)]
*  I would love for the American car manufacturers [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2782.1s)]
*  to actually make cars that aren't baby murder machines. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2786.1s)]
*  Jesus Christ, dude. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2800.1s)]
*  Yeah, make normal cars, you know? [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2812.1s)]
*  Make normal cars and it will be good. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2816.1s)]
*  I mean, aside from the trade deficit, like, [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2824.1s)]
*  you probably should make normal cars in general in America, too. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2826.1s)]
*  That would be nice, I think. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2830.1s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFoh5xEmn0&t=2836.1s)]
