# Joe Rogan Called Out Elizabeth Warren | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU)
*  Yeah. RFK junior, according, I mean, Elizabeth Warren called us out and I gave her credit [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=0.0s)]
*  for this as well at the time, but RFK junior is also making money off of pharmaceuticals. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=4.78s)]
*  He literally, he literally has a, like a hotline where he directs clients to lawyers and picks [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=10.16s)]
*  up a fee for directing clients to a vaccine injury lawyers and shit. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=17.32s)]
*  Yeah. Control shift are worked, which is crazy. Everything is garbanzo, dude. Everything is [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=24.84s)]
*  garbage. Everything is broken. Right-wing populists have completed loss of plot as to [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=34.04s)]
*  who the enemy is. Elizabeth Warren does not take any money from healthcare or any lobbyists [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=37.76s)]
*  or CEOs. Look at the average donation. CEOs don't give $30 increments. Use your brains. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  People have 10,000 nurses give you small contributions. That doesn't mean you're in the pocket of [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=44.44s)]
*  big farm. Look, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  I don't know if you saw this, but Elizabeth Warren got confronted and it's on Twitter [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  this morning. She got confronted about the amount of money that she's received from pharmaceutical [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=54.22s)]
*  drug companies. She said she's never received any money from pharmaceutical drug companies [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=60.18s)]
*  and never received any monies from any packs. And then of course, underneath it, community. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=64.1s)]
*  I'm glad you're covering this very nice stuff. It's not even niche. The problem is it's not [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=69.02s)]
*  niche. Okay. It's actually out in the open. A lot of people, a lot of people think this [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=72.86s)]
*  way now. And a lot of people get their notes off of Twitter. It is no longer a niche, like [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=79.8s)]
*  conspiratorial minded attitude that people have. Okay. Joe Rogan. All right. Well, we [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=84.39999999999999s)]
*  have an RFK pro RFK guy who thinks Bernie has taken money from pharmaceutical corporations, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=92.1s)]
*  but also doesn't like Joe Rogan for some reason. I guess you like the holistic medicine aspect [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=97.32s)]
*  of Joe Rogan, but like maybe supporter. I don't know. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=101.44s)]
*  He notes strikes again. And of course she received millions. She's a liar. Well, and [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=104.11999999999999s)]
*  it, you know, it's an arms race, you know, how can pharma cloak the money that it's giving [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=109.44s)]
*  so that there's plausible deniability at the point that, that Elizabeth Warren is confronted [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=113.67999999999999s)]
*  or Bernie Sanders Sanders was hilarious. Only 1.5 billion, only 1.5 million out of 200 million. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=118.12s)]
*  Like this guy went from being a Bernie Glazer, a Bernie bro to shitting on Bernard Sanders. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=125.52s)]
*  How did this happen? Like how does your brain break in this direction in this severe of [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=132.84s)]
*  a fashion? I do not understand truly only 1.5. Yep. That's what I saw as well. Only the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=137.6s)]
*  hardworking people, the hardworking people in this country gave me money. Well, I don't [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=146.44s)]
*  think got enough. You saw RFK junior, according, I mean, Elizabeth Warren called us out and [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  I gave her credit for this as well at the time, but RFK junior is also making money [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=157.36s)]
*  off of pharmaceuticals. He literally, he literally has a, like a hotline where he directs clients [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=161.66s)]
*  to lawyers and picks up a fee for directing clients to vaccine injury lawyers and shit. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=168.82s)]
*  Okay. People figure out ways to grift chatters sometimes in ways that you cannot comprehend. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=176.82s)]
*  I have to fix everything now. All right. Oh, why is he in his brother has been completely [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=182.74s)]
*  laughed out of academia. Rogan literally robs people of the opportunity to learn. I [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=189.18s)]
*  know, but Weinstein, the bruh, why is he in bros have only one method of making money [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=192.98000000000002s)]
*  now and that is suckling on Joe Rogan's incredibly long nipples. Are you ever wrong and admit [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=198.82s)]
*  to it? Yes. And yes, very famously. So even though there is no, there is no benefit to [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=204.42000000000002s)]
*  admitting that you're wrong ever. It's not even remotely beneficial. And people yell [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=211.44s)]
*  at you all the time, regardless the most famous instance of me being wrong about Vladimir [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=217.20000000000002s)]
*  Putin will never invade Ukraine. That's far too insane for him to do. It would be dating. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=222.68s)]
*  Anyway, I think I know what your problem is. Is this the same computer that you brought [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=229.68s)]
*  to Japan? No chatter. This is my normal desktop. Yes. The analysis was sound. The prediction [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=233.04000000000002s)]
*  was off. Sometimes your insults are a bit graphic for my brain. Fair. Another one I [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=238.58s)]
*  think is something I've thought about a lot. It's the, it's the Ukraine stuff and my initial [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=243.92s)]
*  reaction to react gate. I corrected you over something tiny linguistically, but it made [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=250.26s)]
*  a difference and you immediately backtrack respect where respect is due three years of [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=254.64s)]
*  wrong prediction though. What do you mean? I think that I Ukraine and war is three years. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=258.4s)]
*  What do you mean? I'm confused by this. The people who think this about you are clip watchers. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=262.84s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Bernie's healthcare donors are, are people that work in the healthcare sector [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=267.4s)]
*  and people that work in medicine, people that work in the pharmaceutical companies all the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=272.44s)]
*  way down to like, when you are donating to a, when you're donating to a political campaign, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=276.4s)]
*  you say where you work, you write your place of business, like you write your employer. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=282.2s)]
*  Okay. And then it gets logged as being from that sector. You were wrong about closing [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=287.76s)]
*  a pockets with a certain someone with us more of a hindsight, 20, 20, that kind of thing. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=293.64s)]
*  No, that's not [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M2u2DmqAaU&t=297.4s)]
