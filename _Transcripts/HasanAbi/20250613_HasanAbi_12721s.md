# Exposes U.S. Role In Israel’s War With Iran | Hasan Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk)
*  You say every single conversation that's taking place right now about like Iran's capabilities is bullshit. And it's just a just a way to offer cover to Israel striking Iran out of nowhere. And and trying to defend Israel's ridiculous actions here, you have to remember that okay, understand that anytime [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=0.0s)]
*  systems to work effectively, Israel conducted a very sophisticated Israel conducted a very sophisticated campaign internally inside of Iranian territory, where they were able to build drone facilities inside of Iran, and then launch those drones immediately at the anti air, anti air defense systems that Iran had before launching their strong anti air defense systems. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=21.8s)]
*  And that strikes that I think is that right there I think is an indication that right there I think is an indication that that the Iranian the Iranian government, the the Iranian government is unstable, and not able to not able to defend its citizens appropriately. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=51.8s)]
*  I think a part of the reason why a part of the reason why this, this major, this major blow to Iranian security existed or exists is because is because there are collaborators internally inside of Iran as well. Partially, like I said, as a consequence of how easy it is to to take advantage of the economic instability in Iran, but also, it is important to recognize that Iran is a very strong country. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=75.8s)]
*  It is important to recognize that the the fundamentalist attitudes of the Iranian government and its reception by the Iranian population is a matter of national security at this point for Iran, it plays, in my opinion, a major role in instability in Iran beyond even the economic volatility born out of strangling the Iranian economy. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=104.8s)]
*  Okay, like Western power strangling the economy, the Iranian economy could only work if, if the the the population also has resentment towards its government. And it's clear that there is enough resentment. The Iranian government from the Iranian population [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=132.8s)]
*  continues right after this. Iran has no defense against the missiles. No, they did a drone strike. This was not an impressive strike. This was a lot smaller than the salvo last year. I think the Iranian capabilities have been limited by the Israeli attacks. And if this was the entire response, it just shows Iran is weaker than ever. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=152.8s)]
*  Five, seven hits launched compared to 30 to 40 last year. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=167.8s)]
*  Makes the best and most lethal military shared with Marco Rue Mercheimer is talking about first strike by Israel can Iran defeat Israel? Little bro say I don't know again, what should I do instead say yeah based? Wouldn't you rather have me admit things that are beyond my capabilities of knowledge? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=171.8s)]
*  Instead of just like confidently speaking on shit that I don't know, like other political commentators who don't know anything about Iran or Israel and are simply reacting to the images that they're seeing on camera and just going yeah based Trump is based by the story. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=195.8s)]
*  And there is a domestic political part of this to Cedric, which is that there are a lot of people in the MAGA movement who think that this is Israel dragging the United States into a global conflict. And this is not what people who voted for Donald Trump voted for, notably Tucker Carlson, the commentator who spoke at the Republican convention. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=216.8s)]
*  Israeli official CNN at the cabinet meeting to discuss response, the expectations that Israel will escalate further in its next wave of attacks against Iran. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=238.8s)]
*  Of the United States playing whatever role it did. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=245.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's a really interesting juxtaposition of things here that we're dealing with Jake because you know quite frankly, it's in the U.S. national interest to defend Israel. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=247.8s)]
*  And so when you have a situation where Israel goes preemptively and does an attack, conducts an attack on the Iranian nuclear facilities and other aspects of the Iranian command and control structure, you really have in some ways something that the U.S. administration may not have supported at the beginning, but they can take advantage of it now. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=257.8s)]
*  And that's one of the key things that I think is very interesting about this. The other thing is, you know, since it gives us the strategic opening here from a diplomatic and military perspective, you can also look at some of the movements of military personnel involved in this. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=281.8s)]
*  Can we say Turkey stands with Israel? Turkey absolutely stands with Israel. The Turkish population hates Israel. The Turkish government absolutely stands with Israel. It is the same dynamic that exists within the GCC. It is the same dynamic that exists within every single Arab state. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=294.8s)]
*  Okay, the states themselves, the governments themselves are firmly lapdogs to American interests in the region and therefore align with Israel and will defend Israel. Whereas the populations are not, which is why you hear a lot of anti-Israel sentiment from the politicians and the governments of these countries. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=309.8s)]
*  And that is simply to ensure that there is no rebellion against the governments themselves. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=333.8s)]
*  And they're trying to build and try to weaponize a nuclear weapons program. We knew they'd had for a long time this ability to increase the enrichment of uranium. Now they're talking about weaponization. Prime Minister Netanyahu last night on TV said, we've seen evidence of weaponization. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=341.8s)]
*  So he's saying every single conversation that's taking place right now about like Iran's capabilities is bullshit. And it's just a just a way to offer cover to Israel striking Iran out of nowhere. And and trying to defend Israel's ridiculous actions here. You have to remember that. Okay, understand that anytime any dipshit goes on television to say Iran is like two seconds to midnight about to have a nuke something that stupid ass. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=356.8s)]
*  Stupid ass Benjamin and the house been saying since like not in the Israeli says miss A's like 1984 by the way. Okay, and and much louder calls have been coming from Benjamin and you know directly since 1992. Every year they've said this every goddamn year they have repeated this over and over and over again. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=385.8s)]
*  It's bullshit. The reason why they're saying this is to offer covered Israel as to why Israel attacked out of nowhere, like a bunch of violent hyenas. Ehud Barak argues that if Iran is not compelled to agree to the important imposed terms of his program, then for Israel's order to achieve strategic aims, it will have to become an American with the regime change as the goal. Here is Jeffrey Epstein's buddy, former Prime Minister Ehud Barak, speaking to CNN also manufacturing consent. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=402.8s)]
*  In my judgment, it's not a secret that Israel alone cannot delay the program of Iran by a significant time period, probably several weeks, probably a month. But even the US cannot delay them by more than a few months. It doesn't mean that immediately they will have it. Probably they still have to complete certain [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=432.8s)]
*  weaponization or probably create a device to explode it in somewhere in the desert to show the whole world where they are. But it's clear to me in spite of all the impressive achievements until now, we cannot say that we delay them significantly. As you mentioned, fordo is very, it's probably beyond our capacity to really penetrate. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=456.8s)]
*  And the reality is that Rafael Grossi, the head of IEA, said just a few days ago that the most sensitive elements of the Iranian military program are buried hundreds of yards underneath the surface in some remote, deserted mines and so on. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=483.8s)]
*  And because they already have about 400 kilograms of enriched uranium to 60%, which still had to be pushed to 20, to weapon grade, which is over 90. But that's an easy process could take place in any garage with enough advanced. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=502.8s)]
*  All right. So what's the point then, Prime Minister? What is the point then of this mass campaign? What is the point if you're telling me that they can potentially only damage by a month at worst and maybe a couple of weeks? What is the point? What is the strategy? What's the goal? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=525.8s)]
*  It's problematic, but it still has a justification point of view of Israel. Instead of sitting idle, Israel feels, our government feels that they have to do something. Probably together with the Americans, we can do more. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=542.8s)]
*  My judgment is that because Iran is already what's called threshold nuclear power, the only way to block it is either to impose upon it a convincing new agreement or alternatively open a full scale war to topple down the regime. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=563.8s)]
*  That's something that together with the United States we can do. But having said that, I don't believe that any American president, neither Trump or anyone of his predecessors would have decided. America didn't win in Korea. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=581.8s)]
*  My dad just did the mean. He told me to be nice to Israel. Verbatim, shit you now. He sent me a J-post article. I talked about Israel becoming an international priority. He told me to be nice to Israel and say something positive for once. I of course use the Hassan Abil headline and said, no, that country is Satan incarnate. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=603.8s)]
*  Don't say this. The ADL is going to come after me again. He's going to be like Hassan is molding the minds of the Jewish youth in this country into the most anti-Semitic statement, which is of course saying that the fascist nation of Israel is fascist and engaging in a dual suicide death pack alongside the United States of America. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=615.8s)]
*  I don't believe that they're about to open a full scale war over Iran. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=645.8s)]
*  Which really begs the question, Mr. Prime Minister. You've just listed the number of wars that America has not won. Your own country is in a war that it has not won in Gaza. Yes, it's degraded Iran's capabilities. And now it's done this and it's going to go on for a while according to your Prime Minister. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=650.8s)]
*  But it's also taken out the key layer of military leadership. What effect do you think that will have? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=668.8s)]
*  Look, I think that what the Israelis will tell you is that we did our part. We did whatever we can in order to delay, slow them down or coerce them into a more reliable, more convincing agreement. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=680.8s)]
*  And Israel will tell you that the role to complete it is America's, not our own. And that's not simple. America has a major role, even for Israel to continue the war for a longer time, for several months or so, we need the logistic depths of America. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=697.8s)]
*  And if they decide to operate, of course, their operational capabilities, which are much wider than the Israeli capabilities. But, you know, I still bear in mind what happened with the Houthis. America announced a war on the Houthis and after some four or six weeks, they decided to leave. So it's not true. We're entering the first 24 hours. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=714.8s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, he's doing a call to action to bring America into the bring America, dude. Oh my god, look at this. You will see these images as though Israel has not destroyed every single building in Gaza. You will remember that, you know, there are people that live in apartment complexes, it seems. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=738.8s)]
*  All of a sudden, the media will remember that like human beings are capable of living inside of apartments. They won't say that same. They won't have that same kind of attitude when talking about apartments in Tehran. They certainly will not have that same attitude when talking about apartment complexes in Gaza and not in Lebanon. But of course, now it's humans like actual people, real human beings that whose lives have been threatened. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=756.8s)]
*  Yeah, who were in constant contact had multiple phone calls, including before those strikes on Iran. That was news given that we were told by a number of people that the U.S. was not involved. Now, the U.S. still says that they were not involved in the actual strikes that they that Israel acted unilaterally. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=781.8s)]
*  However, this communication timeline obviously changes the idea of the U.S. or Israel informing the U.S. and the U.S. talking Israel through what was happening. Now, there are still a lot of questions about what this means moving forward. Remember, Donald Trump and the administration's really big goal here is to get a deal, an Iranian nuclear deal. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=802.8s)]
*  And there were the six round of talks on Sunday in Oman with the Middle East envoy Steve Wyckoff. We are told that the administration is still hoping for a six round of talks with the Iranians. Now, there are still a lot of U.S. officials who are casting doubt that this can happen given these strikes. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=821.8s)]
*  But you're hearing from Donald Trump repeatedly on social media today and in calls with reporters where he's saying that the Iranians need to come to the table, that everyone has essentially been killed or wiped out and that it's going to be too late if they don't make a deal as soon as possible. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=836.8s)]
*  So he clearly believes the administration believes that this could give them an edge. These strikes could give them an edge in this process. Unclear whether or not that's actually going to play out the way that they want it to. But that is this is what we are seeing unfold, at least from the U.S. side and from the White House side. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=851.8s)]
*  All right, Kristen, stand by for me. I actually want to go straight back to Orrin Lieberman in Tel Aviv because we're getting some updated reporting about the injuries there in Israel. Orrin, what are you learning? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=867.8s)]
*  We just got an updated number from Magandavid Adom. Again, that's effectively Israel's Red Cross and the number of injuries that have come in from the incoming Iranian ballistic missiles. The latest update is there are 17 injured that we know of so far based on Magandavid Adom in Tel Aviv, one moderately injured, three lightly injured and then in a city called Ramat Gan, which is also in the central Israel area. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=880.8s)]
*  I used to believe that Israel was doing something they had to do and I thought it was justified, but this completely changed my opinion. Now I see what you're saying. You're right. Hell yeah. See, every single day there are new people. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=905.8s)]
*  Again, as I had said, the initial number of seven was only the first. Effectively, the first numbers, emergency responders got out there and evaluated the results of these strikes. This is a number that can continue to rise, but we will certainly keep an eye on it. Again, the latest right now that we have from Magandavid Adom. Let me see if I can get you a time on this. This is just 10 minutes ago. Are 17 injured too seriously, a couple moderately and then the others lightly injured. And we will keep an eye on that number as the evening. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=917.8s)]
*  Israel telling settlers to stop posting Iranian strikes. Oh yeah. Iran's positive news agency reports the capture of an Israeli partnership pilot. According to Israeli media, the occupation army urges settlers to not take photos and videos of the sites where Iranian missiles have landed. They did this last time too. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=945.8s)]
*  They did this last time too. They don't want Israelis to take phone photos like any sort of footage of successful Iranian strikes. They worry what this does to the confidence. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=961.8s)]
*  The US is well to shoot down some of the missiles that were incoming. We know the United States deployed a fad missile air defense systems in Israel last year. That was under the Biden administration. And those batteries are indeed operated largely by US forces. They have been active in this air defense effort. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=991.8s)]
*  In addition to that, I'm told that there is some regional cooperation as well from some of the Arab countries in the region. Although we don't yet have full details on what the extent of that cooperation was. We know of course that several of those countries in the region, some overtly, some more covertly, did indeed provide assistance to Israel during the two previous Iranian attacks. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1008.8s)]
*  Not the glaze Israel, but Israel killed many top officials and Iran didn't kill nobody, not even a civilian. I think it's safe to say that the first round goes to Israel. Bro, what are you talking about? Is this in team sports? [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1028.8s)]
*  Average American, average European or American assessment of the situation. It's like one nil Israel, I guess. Sick man. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1037.8s)]
*  Inside of Iran, I'm told that the expectation is that the result of that meeting will be an escalatory step from Israel, meaning not just a tit for tat, but climbing up that you have to also understand in a way that Israeli Israeli society only gets to operate with this level of bloodlust under the banner of Israeli security under the banner of Western security. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1054.8s)]
*  So any kind of penetration of that security umbrella is going to have extreme impact is going to have a much different impact amongst the collective conscience of Israel. Look at post October 7 and the anger and resentment that they had towards Netanyahu. Obviously that swept away with the bloodlust. Bloodlust is always, like I said, the glue that holds Israeli society together. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1080.8s)]
*  But I don't know. I don't know. I don't know where this goes. I just don't think that like I said, there's there's two options either. This is deterrence. Force is the only thing that Israel responds to with restraint. Unfortunately, and this is a reasonable deterrence, depending on what the situation is. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1105.8s)]
*  I don't think that the rest of the strikes look like once they land in Israel, because like there's been a second barrage and a third barrage. I don't think that they've actually made their you know, I don't think they've actually hit Israel yet. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1135.8s)]
*  There's also hold on. Yeah, I told Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Hameini has addressed the nation following the launch of Iran's missile strikes earlier tonight below is the full translated transcript of his speech in which he vows Israel started this and will not escape unscathed. Okay. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1156.8s)]
*  But the reason I was with my dear nation is that they made a grave mistake. A serious error. They made a big mistake. A miscalculation and they will face the consequences of their actions by the grace of God. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1216.8s)]
*  The Iranian nation will not overlook the blood of its honorable martyrs. It will not ignore the violation of its airspace. Our armed forces are ready and the country's officials along with all segments of the population stand firmly behind the armed forces. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1242.8s)]
*  Today, messages of unity have been issued from all political factions and various groups across the country. Everyone feels that we must act decisively against the vile despicable Zionist entity. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1268.8s)]
*  Zionist entity, we must act with strength and God willing, we will act with strength. There will be no leniency with them. Life will become bitter for them. Let them not think for a moment. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1289.8s)]
*  That they can strike and get away with it. They started this and they initiated the war. We will not allow them to escape unscathed from this great crime they have committed. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1318.8s)]
*  Certainly the armed forces of the Islamic Republic will deliver heavy blows to this malicious enemy. The nation is behind us supporting the armed forces and by God's permission the Islamic Republic will prevail over the Zionist regime. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1340.8s)]
*  Know this and be assured, rest easy, knowing that no negligence will occur in this matter. Blessings be upon you. Peace of God be upon you. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1359.8s)]
*  How unified is the Iranian populace behind the Iranian government? I mean, regardless of the unpopularity of the Iranian government through certain segments of Iranian society, in times of military action against the Iranian state, many, many segments of the population that would normally be in the Iranian regime. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1369.8s)]
*  The Iranian government will obviously harden in their opposition to external forces. So it's always a galvanizing factor, which also caused me to think that Israel will also have a similar situation as well. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1388.8s)]
*  But this was the reason why the Iranian revolution took place to begin with. And this was the reason why the Islamist forces were seen as the most anti-West, uncorruptible forces. It was because of external intervention, American and British intervention and the defense of the shah, the brutal shah monarchy rally around the family with a pocketful of shells. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1408.8s)]
*  What does that mean? If this escalates dramatically, would Russia or China not support Iran? How is Russia supposed to support Iran, dude? If anything, this actually, this actually hurts Russia's position in Ukraine, because they rely on the Shahed drones that they get from Iran as well. Oh, it's Rage Against the Machine lyrics. Okay, I didn't know that. I don't listen to music. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1435.8s)]
*  Who said it was a full spectrum blitz? They're still trying to figure out exactly what was impacted here. But based on what they are seeing, there is an indication that there could have been a cyber element to this military attack as well. We're watching to see if that actually plays out if there was a cyber element. But of course, the US trying to figure out what Israel accomplished and of course, what that means for what it'll want to continue doing as they're promising more strikes. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1457.8s)]
*  All right, Kylie Atwood for us. Kylie, thank you very much for that. I want to go now to Natasha Bertran. She's at the Pentagon and Natasha, you've been reporting on the US involvement in trying to thwart these Iranian strikes, this retaliation. What do we know about that is, of course, we seem to be expecting more through the afternoon and evening. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1486.8s)]
*  Yeah, Casey, this had been kind of an open question whether the US would help defend Israel against this Iranian barrage that is widely anticipated in response to these strikes. The answer to that, according to the official officials, is yes. The US is using military assets that it has all across the Middle East really at this point to help take down many of those projectiles. The US has assets in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. They have ships in the Red Sea. They have ships in the Mediterranean Sea. They have ships in the Mediterranean Sea. They have ships in the Mediterranean Sea. They have ships in the Mediterranean Sea. They have ships in the Mediterranean Sea. They have ships in the Mediterranean Sea. They have ships in the Mediterranean Sea. They have ships in the Mediterranean Sea. They have ships in the Mediterranean Sea. They have ships in the Mediterranean Sea. They have ships in the Mediterranean Sea. They have ships in the Mediterranean Sea. They have ships in the Mediterranean Sea. They have ships in the Mediterranean Sea. They have ships in the Mediterranean Sea. They have ships in the Mediterranean Sea [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1503.8s)]
*  as well as in the Eastern Mediterranean. They have Patriot air defense batteries that are stationed across the region. They also have terminal high altitude air defense systems, all of which can help take these missiles and drones down. Now it's unclear at this point the extent to which the US has been helping. All we have from US officials at this point is that the US military is engaging. And of course, the US also has interest in the region as well. There are hundreds of thousands of Americans that live in Israel. There are also a number of very important military assets. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1533.8s)]
*  In the region as well, of course, as US troops. And so the US sees this not only as an imperative to help defend its key ally in the Middle East, but also, of course, to help defend its own troops and its own people. And so it remains to be seen just how many of these missiles and drones the US has actually been able to help take down. But safe to say it is probably a significant number if history is any sign because the US, of course, over the past two times that Iran has hit Israel with ballistic missiles, the US has been able to take down the US. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1563.8s)]
*  The US has been very instrumental in helping take those projectiles down, Casey. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1593.8s)]
*  All right, Natasha Bertrand, Foreign Affairs, Natasha, thank you. I want to bring in Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton. Colonel Leighton, it's always good to see you. Thanks for being here. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1597.3999999999999s)]
*  Can you just help us understand a little bit more about the reporting that Natasha just laid out there for us? What does this say about the US posture going forward? [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1606.2s)]
*  Yeah, Casey, I think that's a really interesting piece that Natasha put together there because what you're talking about is really how much the US has helped with the air defense of Israel, the air and missile defense of Israel. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1618.0s)]
*  And what we're seeing is the based on what happened so far in this particular situation, as well as what happened back in October and before that during the past summer, you have a situation where the Israeli missile and air defense systems, [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1630.8s)]
*  the Iron Dome, David Sling and the Aero systems, they are very good, but they need some help. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1647.1s)]
*  And that help is what we are providing in the form of the Aegis systems that are on board the Navy vessels, as well as Air Force assets and other assets that we have in the region. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1653.3s)]
*  So it's a combination of radar and intelligence support that is being provided to the Israelis. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1663.3s)]
*  Elint News, are you still in the chat if you are? Can you send me like one of these graphics that shows the comprehensive defense capabilities that Israel has? [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1670.5s)]
*  I know you got one of them ready to rip or if anyone else has one of those graphics because I want to show the full extent because Israel has American like Western funded and Western R&D researched [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1679.7s)]
*  defense capabilities that go far beyond Iron Dome, even though it's like colloquially all under the banner of Iron Dome. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1694.8s)]
*  Iron Dome is just simply for like, do you mean OSINT? Elint News is an OSINT account, but is a reliable one. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1702.5s)]
*  And but outside of that, there's still obviously the Western force in the region that are also an additional American weapons that were sent into Israel under the Biden administration. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1708.8s)]
*  That plays a role in the Israeli defenses. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1720.8s)]
*  And then beyond that, you got Jordan. You got defenses inside of Jordan. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1725.0s)]
*  You have defenses all around. Israel has a right to defend itself, guys. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1732.2s)]
*  That's why you have to look at this building, this one building. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1738.2s)]
*  I like that they're only showing this one building and not like potentially a nuclear facility or even orders. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1742.3s)]
*  Like it's interesting that they are not showing any of that shit. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1748.3s)]
*  What is this? [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1751.0s)]

*  Why are we backing this? [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1766.0s)]
*  Like I don't understand. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1767.0s)]
*  They're doing a whole lot of genocide and we're just okay with it. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1767.6s)]
*  Now this right before Trump's big beautiful day and we're going to back them. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1769.5s)]
*  Dude, Trump's big beautiful genocide is what is going on. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1773.7s)]
*  And it was Biden's genocide before it was Trump's genocide. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1780.1000000000001s)]
*  It is America's genocide. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1783.5s)]

*  Okay, you have to understand. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1790.5s)]
*  This isn't Israel's own actions. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1793.4s)]
*  Israel is not a sovereign state. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1798.6000000000001s)]
*  Israel does not do anything without America's go-ahead. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1801.6000000000001s)]
*  Israel cannot do anything without American munitions. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1805.6000000000001s)]
*  Israel cannot do anything without American funds. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1809.0s)]
*  Israel is an extension of America. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1811.7s)]
*  It's not just an unsinkable aircraft carrier in a resource-rich region. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1814.7s)]
*  It is a state. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1821.9s)]
*  I disagree. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1823.8000000000002s)]

*  And you will constantly find yourself duped. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1830.2s)]
*  This is why I kept saying over and over and over again that the whole charade of Donald Trump [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1832.9s)]
*  is at odds with Israel was not going to amount to anything. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1842.3s)]
*  And Donald Trump showed that it was not going to amount to anything with the Edan Alexander deal with Hamas. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1849.2s)]
*  American taxpayers keep spending tens of billions to restock these systems under the completely false premise [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1857.1s)]
*  that they're defensive when they enable Israel to feel like it can strike civilian targets in other countries cost-free. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1861.3s)]
*  Diplomacy is impossible without consequences. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1866.7s)]
*  You would not strike apartment buildings in Tehran if you thought the blowback would be two dozen districts hit on Tel Aviv. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1869.3s)]
*  It's that they think most of the damage will be avoided because of the billions that... [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1874.9s)]
*  because of our billions of weapons systems that emboldens them to act crazy. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1879.1s)]
*  This is 100% correct. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1882.5s)]
*  This is absolutely correct. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1884.8s)]
*  We also need to stop finding the Iron Dome and David Sling interceptor systems that give Israel the leadership [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1886.3s)]
*  in a sense of invulnerability and only function to enable more bellicose and crazy acts of aggression by the IDF, [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1891.0s)]

*  Okay, this is the other side of the story. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1900.3999999999999s)]
*  Without the Iron Dome, without David Sling, without the Aero systems, Israel would not be able to act in this manner. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1905.2s)]
*  This is why I'm saying that even with all of the damage, the IDF is now attempting to claim this kind of damage Tel Aviv was mostly caused by shrapnel. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=1912.8999999999999s)]

*  They can be cast aside. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2132.6s)]
*  Israel is in a different position. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2134.5s)]
*  While those Arab states could be destroyed by Iran and America would never even bat an eye, Israel is in a unique predicament. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2136.6000000000004s)]
*  Though those states are only valuable to America as long as they play ball and defend Israel. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2144.5s)]
*  To take non-essential personnel out of harm's way. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2149.3s)]
*  So there were some signals, but there was supposed to be a next round of negotiations between the Trump administration and the Iranian regime in Oman this Sunday. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2152.5s)]
*  So I don't think from what I know now that there was explicit approval or participation in this attack by the Trump administration. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2163.5s)]
*  I do think that in the last few days, the statement by the board of the IAEA, the world sort of nuclear watchdog that Iran had taken significant steps to increase enrichment [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2175.4s)]
*  and was operating outside of the nonproliferation treaty and the response by Iran to announce a new enrichment facility. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2189.0s)]
*  That moved us into a more dangerous period. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2199.8s)]
*  But I expected that the next thing that was going to happen this weekend would be negotiations in Oman, not an Israeli preemptive strike. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2203.8s)]
*  Yeah, Israeli preemptive strike. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2212.4s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2215.4s)]
*  Israel is playing us a fool again. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2216.0s)]
*  Oh, we're so mad. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2218.9s)]
*  Stop defending Israel. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2220.3s)]
*  He faced the possible stop defending Israel then demand that we cut off defensive capabilities to Israel to force them not just offensive capabilities, [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2221.3s)]
*  defensive capabilities to Israel to force them to the fucking bargaining table to force them to actually implement a real negotiations process. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2230.7000000000003s)]
*  Israel lobbying funds means that Israel has effectively bought support from Congress. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2238.6s)]
*  They've always done this before World War Two funding systems are focused on the British Empire in the 1930s. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2243.5s)]
*  Yes, but Israel the Israel lobby is the same as like I believe if I were to put it on a sliding scale. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2248.0s)]
*  Okay, Merck Sharmer says it's primarily the Israel lobby and Noam Chomsky says there are additional ideological interests at play Zionism specifically, right? [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2258.1s)]
*  It's both. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2269.6s)]
*  It's not one or the other. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2270.4s)]
*  It's both. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2272.1s)]
*  There is the real ideological investment that Christian Zionists have evangelical Christian Zionists have there's the real ideological investment in the the project of Israel the project of Greater Israel from America from the perspective of their ambition in the region to control the region entirely. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2273.2s)]
*  Okay, but then there's also the lobbying now. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2289.2s)]
*  It's both the and that's precisely the reason why it's both is because. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2293.6s)]
*  It's not a separate entity. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2298.7s)]
*  Israel is not a separate entity. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2301.7999999999997s)]
*  Israel is an extension of the United States of America. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2303.2s)]
*  Stop arguing with AUK 2000. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2307.2999999999997s)]
*  Wait this person. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2310.6s)]
*  I don't think I'm not even arguing with this person. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2312.2999999999997s)]

*  I don't know why you guys think this is like that stalker account and calm down. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2316.5s)]
*  Anyway, Israel saying that Israel is even a. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2320.0s)]
*  Saying that Israel would even saying that Israel is a puppet state of America is wrong. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2323.2s)]
*  Israel is just an extension of America. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2330.7999999999997s)]
*  Israel is an expression of America in the region. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2332.7999999999997s)]
*  Israel is just a state. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2336.3999999999996s)]
*  Okay, Israel is that American state so both the the influence peddling and the lobbying works hand-in-hand, but the but the way that the lobbying works in this country. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2338.7999999999997s)]
*  In the United States of America is not dissimilar to the NRA. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2353.2s)]
*  The NRA plays a role in making sure that politicians act in a way. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2357.0s)]
*  Act in a way where they when push comes to shove and there's a lot of political pressure from the public to to make changes to gun laws. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2367.2s)]
*  The NRA is paying constantly their politicians to ensure that they do not that they do not step out of line. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2375.5s)]
*  This is the same thing that the Israeli lobby does right? [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2384.0s)]
*  These people are already organically pro-Israel. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2387.9s)]
*  But when there's tremendous pressure from the constituents to not be pro-Israel, that's influence plays a big role that and also. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2391.9s)]
*  You know quietly trying to craft legislation as they have done successfully like the anti-BDS legislation where you have to do a loyalty pledge to Israel all the stuff Israel definitely has greater influence in US politics in the US doesn't Israel. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2401.8s)]
*  You're absolutely wrong about that point. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2413.8s)]
*  The United States has full control over Israel. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2416.6s)]
*  It does not matter none of these countries are real democracies. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2422.2000000000003s)]
*  These are theoretical democracies. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2425.8s)]
*  The United States is a theoretical democracy and so is Israel. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2427.6s)]
*  Okay, if the United States were to turn around and say it's no longer in our best interest for you to continue doing a genocide in Gaza Israel would be forced to stop tomorrow. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2431.2000000000003s)]
*  If the United States said do not strike Iran, we are very serious about our nuclear negotiations. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2442.9s)]
*  They need to do the denuclearization agreement that we have with Iran. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2449.7000000000003s)]
*  We don't want you to fat up. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2454.5s)]
*  Israel would never strike Iran never in terms of like. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2456.6s)]
*  Influence does the US have influence over what the Israeli society thinks maybe not but they don't need to they don't need to influence Israeli society. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2460.9s)]
*  Israel on the other hand does need to influence American society because they don't want the level of pressure that currently exists against Israel to exist at all. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2471.4s)]
*  That is the reason why there is a incredibly sophisticated incredibly pervasive influence peddling campaign in the Western world. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2484.1s)]
*  That's the reason why Benjamin Netanyahu who is an American dual citizen by the way who also worked with the American intelligence in the past a person from Philadelphia who grew up in Philadelphia who went to MIT. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2493.1s)]
*  Okay. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2505.8s)]
*  Is the leader of Israel almost in perpetuity at this point and will deliver speeches in English his first speech that he delivered after striking Iran was in English. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2507.2000000000003s)]
*  Why did he do that Israel speaks Hebrew? [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2518.2000000000003s)]
*  They understand the importance of trying to change the dynamic change the narrative and massage the narrative and contextualize why these violent and belligerent actions have to take place and feed the American population with the appropriate contextualization better than you do. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2520.6s)]
*  I think Israel is an extension of the US. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2537.5s)]
*  I'm saying direct control is an exaggeration. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2540.4s)]
*  No America has direct control over Israel. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2542.4s)]
*  It's just ridiculous to suggest that that is not the case without America right now. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2544.4s)]
*  You see those interceptors you see this this missile right there intercepting those missiles would not be intercepting shit. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2550.4s)]
*  Those missiles would not be intercepting shit. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2557.4s)]
*  Perhaps drone and cruise missile attacks as well. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2560.3s)]
*  But that's just scratch. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2562.3s)]
*  How is it in America's interest to genocide Gaza? [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2564.3s)]
*  Very simple. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2566.3s)]
*  The greater Israeli project is part ideological for a lot of Zionists and part ending the disruptive force of the Israeli government. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2568.3s)]
*  The greater Israeli project is part ideological for a lot of Zionists and part ending the disruptive force that is a constant pressure on Israel's complete conquest in the region. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2578.2000000000003s)]
*  It's the same as the Houthis is the same as his bull. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2595.2000000000003s)]
*  These are these are pressure points that can cause at times penalties to Israeli society. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2602.1s)]
*  Message to the nation. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2619.1s)]
*  He said that the military was prepared to counterattack. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2620.1s)]
*  He said don't think that they hit and it's over. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2623.1s)]
*  He said they started the work and started the war. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2626.1s)]
*  He went on to say that he will not allow them to escape safely from his great crime they committed. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2630.0s)]
*  And that's what Haman is saying. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2633.0s)]
*  Morgan. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2635.0s)]
*  All right, Lily, let's bring you back in. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2637.0s)]
*  Because what are US assets currently in the region or what type of assets are currently in the region? [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2639.0s)]
*  What steps might the Pentagon take next from here? [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2643.0s)]
*  Right, Morgan, we have 40,000 US military troops in the entire region. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2645.0s)]
*  Many of them on large bases in areas like Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2651.0s)]
*  And it's some, of course, the 2,500 troops in Baghdad and other parts of Iraq and about 1,500 now inside of Syria. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2657.9s)]
*  But there are also nine US Navy ships in the Mediterranean, excuse me, in the Middle East region. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2665.9s)]
*  And we've just learned that earlier today, two additional Navy vessels capable of shooting down incoming ballistic missiles, [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2670.9s)]
*  as happened last year that the United States provided assistance to Israel in shooting down some of those barrages of missiles coming from Iran, [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2678.9s)]
*  that two of those ships are now in the Eastern Mediterranean, obviously closer to Israel than they had been yet last night, [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2686.8s)]
*  and that this move was done by US European command as a precautionary move in light of Israel's attack against Iran. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2692.8s)]
*  And I think part of that is the thinking that Iran was going to retaliate with missile barrages like they did last year. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2700.8s)]
*  Now, those nine other ships that we're talking about in the Middle East are three of them here in the Red Sea. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2706.8s)]
*  Okay, everyone wants me to show my food. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2712.8s)]

*  35% off, by the way. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2742.6s)]
*  Santark Bloom, thank you for the 20 gifted. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2744.6s)]
*  Large military presence in the region and in terms of assets that could be used potentially to shoot down any incoming barrage of Iranian missiles. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2746.6s)]
*  We have ships that are capable of doing that. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2754.6s)]
*  We have the THAAD that Dennis Blocker was talking about, and we also have Patriot missiles there. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2756.6s)]
*  And in the past when Iran has fired drones, launched barrages of drones, American fighter aircraft were also involved in shooting down them. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2763.5s)]
*  We don't have any indication right so far today that that has happened, but at least we know that there has been US assistance in shooting down some of the Iranian ballistic missiles that were fired at Iran. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2769.5s)]
*  Excuse me, at Israel. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2777.5s)]
*  All right, let's bring in Javik because Javik, we know that you're a great journalist. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2779.5s)]
*  I think we're going to start with the question of how might this attack embolden Iran's proxies? [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2784.4s)]
*  And what would that mean for the region in addition to the United States as Louis was talking about all of the resources that are spread out across the mid-east? [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2790.4s)]
*  So looking at Iran's axis of resistance, that web of grids that Iran has in the region, that's where the greatest threat that Iran has is. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2796.4s)]
*  And that is the threat that Iran has in the region. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2806.4s)]
*  So looking at Iran's axis of resistance, that web of groups and organizations that Iran had supported for decades, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in the Gaza Strip, Iran's relationship with the Houthis, at least a decade. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2809.3s)]
*  So I don't think actually the resistance partners are going to do much for Iran right now because they've been so degraded. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2829.3s)]
*  I think the threat is more directly from Iran. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2835.3s)]
*  All right, let's go back to Lama Hassan. Lama, give us a state of play here. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2838.2000000000003s)]
*  You know, we're seeing the video come in. We talked about the Iron Dome. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2842.2000000000003s)]
*  We talked about just the resources that are in the area. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2844.2000000000003s)]
*  But we also know that this comes in advance of nuclear talks. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2847.2000000000003s)]
*  Where does that stand and how does all of this impact those potential talks? [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2851.2000000000003s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2855.2000000000003s)]
*  I think right at this point, I think it's unlikely that those talks will go ahead given what's going on. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2857.2000000000003s)]
*  And now we have to see how Israel is going to retaliate and what is going to happen as we've been reporting all night tonight that this could go on for days or weeks. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2866.1s)]
*  So I think it will be interesting to see the next steps, what Israel does and how this will impact these talks. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2875.1s)]
*  But I think at this point, it's probably safe to say that we can expect them not to go ahead. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2882.1s)]
*  The only way to fund and support the broadcast is by subscribing. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2889.1s)]
*  Those are on or off the table. Lama, Louie, Matt, Darrell and Javid. As always, thank you both. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2892.0s)]
*  All right, and we'll have much more breaking news coverage just ahead of Iran launching another barrage of missiles out as Israel. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2897.0s)]
*  As tensions soar across the region, you're watching ABC News Live Reports. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2903.0s)]
*  What about the Suez crisis went against the Eisenhower administration which Israel takes sovereign nation unprovoked and the U.S. was against it? [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2907.0s)]
*  This doesn't mean Israel doesn't step out of line every now and then, chatter. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2914.0s)]
*  But Israel gets to step out of line every now and then because of its importance. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2918.9s)]
*  Israel gets to step out of line and even do USS Liberty, for example, and kill a bunch of American Navy members for the crime of spying on Israel. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2922.9s)]
*  Also, basic common conscience, any damage to these facilities leads to catastrophic radiological consequences that would not be confined to Iran but could spread across the region and beyond. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2948.9s)]
*  Only a regime devoid of humanity and responsibility would endanger millions of lives in pursuit of its destruction. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2967.9s)]
*  What is happening? It's okay. Frame dropping, frame drops, drop top. It wasn't a big F. It was a mini F. We're back. We're back. We're back. We're back. We're back. We're back. We're back. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2978.8s)]
*  The Geneva Convention and multiple Security Council and IAEA General Conference resolutions, all of which prohibit attacks or threats against nuclear facilities under safeguards. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=2989.7000000000003s)]
*  Above all, this aggression is a grave breach of the United Nations Charter, particularly Article 2, paragraph 4, which prohibit the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any member state. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3004.6s)]
*  Israel also violated Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The permanent mission of Iraq today formally protested and condemned this violation of its territorial integrity in a letter to the Security Council and the Secretary General. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3021.5s)]
*  Madam President, those who support this regime with the United States at the forefront must understand that they are complicit by aiding and enabling these crimes by their shared full responsibility for the consequences supporting Israel today, supporting war crimes, crimes against humanity, and deliberate undermining of global peace and security. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3038.4s)]
*  The Israeli regime's long-standing crimes against the oppressed Palestinian people, its repeated violation of the sovereignty of regional countries, and its possessions of undeclared weapons of mass destruction have made the Middle East [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3067.3s)]
*  a cauldron of chronic instability since its creation. It is long overdue for the international community to act. This regime must be disarmed of all weapons of mass destruction, placed under international supervision, and held fully accountable. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3083.7000000000003s)]
*  Madam President, this is not a regional issue. This is not merely an attack on one country. This is a direct assault on the international order, an attack on the charter of the United Nations, the UN system, the global nuclear nonproliferation regime, as well as the authority of the IAEA. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3102.6s)]
*  Israeli leadership, including its criminal prime minister, has shamelessly and publicly claimed responsibility for these heinous acts. Israeli officials say that this aggression aims to wreck nuclear talks. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3123.5s)]
*  This confession alone is enough to reveal the real motive behind the attack to kill diplomacy, to sabotage negotiation, and to drag the region into wider conflict. This leaves no room for denial. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3138.4s)]
*  Furthermore, the aggression was intentional, coordinated, and fully backed by a permanent member of this council, the United States. The United States' complicity in this terrorist attack is beyond doubt. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3155.3s)]
*  The officials of the United States have expressly and presently confessed their willful aid and assistance in the crimes and gross violations that the Israeli regime committed, as of last night, including the deliberate transfer of arms. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3170.2000000000003s)]
*  We will not forget that our people lost their lives as a result of the Israeli attacks with American weapons. These actions amount to a declaration of war. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3188.1s)]
*  They are the latest in a long and well-documented pattern of lawless destabilizing and aggressive behavior by the Israeli regime, a regime that acts with impunity because it is shielded by powerful allies. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3199.0s)]
*  This must end. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3216.0s)]
*  Madam President, the Security Council must act now, firmly and decisively. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3219.0s)]
*  In 1981, this very council responded unanimously to the Israeli military attack on Iraqi Osirak nuclear reactor by adopting resolution 487, which unequivocally condemned the aggression as a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3223.9s)]
*  The council also called on this criminal regime to refrain from any such acts or threats in the future. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3238.8s)]
*  Had the council enforced that resolution and held Israel accountable at that time, this regime would not have been emboldened to continue this attack. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3255.8s)]
*  The current aggression is a direct consequence of the case of inaction on double standards. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3268.8s)]
*  By the way, NewsWire is reporting that there are new strikes in Iran. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3281.8s)]
*  Israel is now going back to pummeling Iran again in retaliation for the retaliation by Iran. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3287.8s)]
*  The Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said that the Trump administration was fully aware of what he was going to do before he did it, what his government was going to do. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3292.7000000000003s)]
*  Do you believe him? [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3305.7000000000003s)]
*  Yes. No Israeli government would launch this type of attack without first coordinating and alerting the American government, regardless of who the Prime Minister and President is. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3308.7000000000003s)]
*  And do you know, is there anything you can tell us about this attack? [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3315.7000000000003s)]
*  I mean, what is your understanding of their posture when this was all set to unfold? [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3318.6s)]
*  I can't, and candidly, I'm not confident that there was a coherent response from the American government. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3325.6s)]
*  I mean, think about who we have on our side of the table right now. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3329.6s)]
*  You've got Ambassador Huckabee, who is entirely focused on issues in the West Bank and is quite extreme on those issues. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3333.6s)]
*  You've got the President of the United States, who is very much concerned about the situation in the United States. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3338.6s)]
*  You've got the President of the United States, who is very much concerned about the situation in the United States. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3343.6s)]
*  You've got the President of the United States, who is very much concerned about the situation in the United States. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3346.5s)]
*  You've got Donald Trump, who says a different thing every 12 hours about Gaza and the West Bank and Iran. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3351.5s)]
*  There's a deal, there's not a deal. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3355.5s)]
*  You've got Pete Hegseth and Tulsi Gabbard, who are not exactly wired tight on national security issues, as anybody who's watched their congressional testimony will tell you. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3358.5s)]
*  So it's just not clear to me that there was a coherent response from the American government when this alert was given. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3365.5s)]
*  And I'm not saying that in a partisan capacity. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3369.5s)]
*  It doesn't make me happy to say that. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3373.5s)]
*  But again, what I want to see, regardless of whether it's a Democrat or Republican in the Oval Office, is strong, bold leadership of the free world. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3376.5s)]
*  The kind of leadership that George H.W. Bush would have offered, the kind of leadership that Joe Biden offers from Ukraine. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3383.5s)]
*  This is a Democrat. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3389.5s)]
*  So both parties can do it, it's just that this guy is not. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3392.5s)]
*  Congressman, one person you didn't mention there is Steve Jobs, who has been a personal envoy and has actually been in these rooms. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3395.5s)]
*  I think I got a sense of what you think of him. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3403.5s)]
*  I think you're going to talk to him there based on your reaction. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3406.5s)]
*  But what role do you think he's playing here, and is it productive? [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3409.5s)]
*  He was part of the hostage negotiations that got an American home from Gaza. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3413.5s)]
*  So I compliment and appreciate that work. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3417.5s)]
*  And to the extent that he can credibly speak on behalf of the President of the United States to both Iranian and Israeli political interests, that can be helpful. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3421.5s)]
*  I mean, that is one of the roles of the United States right now, is to de-escalate while ensuring that the United States is not going to be a threat to the United States. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3433.5s)]
*  Oh yeah, totally. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3436.5s)]
*  And so if he can play that role, then someone's got to. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3439.5s)]
*  But he's not someone whose track record inspires a lot of confidence. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3443.5s)]
*  It's so funny that people still try to act as though there is no uniparty position on Israel and American foreign policy. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3449.5s)]
*  Every Democrat is coming out to be like, hey, I think the real problem here is Trump's aesthetics. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3458.5s)]
*  Like he is just all over the place. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3461.4s)]
*  We would show a unified front and defend Israel harder than Trump. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3464.4s)]
*  Psychotic. Like, psychotic. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3468.4s)]
*  This is psychotic. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3471.4s)]
*  This is utterly insane. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3474.4s)]
*  Oh my God, I'll die if I listen to Danny Denon right now defend this shit. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3476.4s)]

*  U.S. diplomats in Tel Aviv had to request assistance from the Marine Corps because so much of the local guard force has been activated by the IDF per diplomatic cable leaked to me. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3503.4s)]

*  I mean, I think the whole world's barred because they were just pushed to this final solution by Israel. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3548.3s)]
*  It turns out this is a pre-planned military operation. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3553.3s)]

*  Tucker Carlson spells out a list of conservatives who are pressing Trump to dedicate more US military resources and personnel. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3602.2000000000003s)]
*  To Israel, except Tucker Carlson himself also plays a role in this, okay? [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3608.2000000000003s)]
*  Do not make the mistake of assuming that he is an independent actor here or that he is in any way, shape, or form against this kind of war. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3612.2000000000003s)]
*  He's not. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3620.2000000000003s)]
*  Okay, he absolutely is not. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3622.2000000000003s)]
*  Israel has opened up this massive front with Iran. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3624.2000000000003s)]
*  They are still fighting in Gaza. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3628.2000000000003s)]
*  What do you think the Israeli people will tolerate here? [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3632.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, Casey, look, the Israeli people will tolerate. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3635.1s)]
*  What do you think the Israeli people will tolerate? [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3637.1s)]
*  Without a doubt. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3639.1s)]
*  Coming up now on almost two years of military action in Gaza. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3641.1s)]
*  Consistent mobilizations of the reserves, and the reserves are the population. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3645.1s)]
*  So there's exhaustion there. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3649.1s)]
*  But you know, this really was the most daring military gamble that Israel has taken since the Six Day War in 1967. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3651.1s)]
*  And the dice are still rolling. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3659.1s)]
*  So we don't know how this is going to unfold. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3661.1s)]
*  And I think for the Israeli people, there is a deep fear and concern and trepidation about Iran. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3664.0s)]
*  Oh no. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3669.0s)]
*  They look at where Iran has been going, what it's been supporting along Israel's borders. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3671.0s)]
*  This advancement of the nuclear program. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3675.0s)]
*  And I think to David's point, there's going to be a lot of unity of support for these strikes. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3677.0s)]
*  Certainly in the near term. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3681.0s)]
*  But if it continues to drag, it's really going to burn out the population. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3683.0s)]
*  It's so daring. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3687.0s)]
*  Yeah, the real concern is... [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3689.0s)]
*  Just as you were finishing your thought there, Joel, we just got net-fused in. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3691.0s)]
*  How much appetite Israeli population has for going back to kill children in Gaza. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3693.9s)]
*  Oh no. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3699.9s)]
*  You know, David Sanger, I will say, it's very rare for us to see physical damage in Israel's reports of injuries. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3701.9s)]
*  We are watching full-scope. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3707.9s)]
*  Because of course of the air protection system that they have. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3709.9s)]
*  Were you surprised to see that? [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3713.9s)]
*  And what implications do you think it has for the next phase of this conflict? [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3715.9s)]
*  Well, I think certainly when there were the missile exchanges last year, the United States... [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3719.9s)]
*  We have full spectrum coverage on every single mainstream media outlet right now. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3722.8s)]
*  Not a single one is talking in a way where they're like, Israel is so belligerent, Israel is so insane. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3738.8s)]
*  How is Israel planning to bring America into this war? [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3746.8s)]
*  No one is saying this. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3749.7000000000003s)]
*  Everyone is talking about how Israel is a victim. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3751.7000000000003s)]
*  How Israel had to do this incredible military campaign. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3755.7000000000003s)]
*  All of this shit. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3759.7000000000003s)]
*  Incredible stuff. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3761.7000000000003s)]
*  Joel Rubin, David Sanger, thank you both very much for your time and your expertise today. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3763.7000000000003s)]

*  Don't go anywhere. CNN's breaking news coverage continues. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3771.7000000000003s)]
*  Have you noticed that? [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3773.7000000000003s)]
*  Have you noticed that no one is calling out Israel's behavior? [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3775.7000000000003s)]
*  It's ridiculous actions here. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3778.6s)]
*  They deliberately targeted civilians. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3780.6s)]
*  Here's that animal, Danny Danon. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3782.6s)]
*  The destruction of these missile systems is a moral imperative. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3784.6s)]
*  These are weapons with the capacity to reach thousands of kilometers. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3790.6s)]
*  Leaving them in the hands of a radical regime, one that openly dreamed of wiping our nation off the map, was not an option. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3795.6s)]
*  We will not hesitate. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3805.6s)]
*  We will not relent. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3808.6s)]
*  And we will not allow a genocidal regime to endanger our people. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3810.6s)]
*  Third, we struck the core of the nuclear program. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3815.6s)]
*  The underground enrichment facilities at Natanz. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3819.6s)]
*  This facility was operating at a military-grade capacity. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3823.6s)]
*  Intelligence confirmed that within days Iran could have produced enough material to... [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3827.6s)]
*  It's so crazy hearing Israel say genocidal regime. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3835.6s)]
*  And not refer to itself. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3838.5s)]
*  And how dangerous and belligerent another country in the region is. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3840.5s)]
*  This operation was carried out because the alternative was unthinkable. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3844.5s)]
*  How long did the world expect us to wait? [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3852.5s)]
*  How long? [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3856.5s)]
*  Let's talk and think about it. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3858.5s)]
*  Until they assembled the bomb? [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3860.5s)]
*  Until they mounted it on a Shahab missile? [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3862.5s)]
*  Until it was on route to Tel Aviv or Jerusalem? [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3868.5s)]
*  Like the more than 100 missiles that they sent an hour ago? [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3872.5s)]
*  How long should we wait? [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3876.5s)]
*  And if anyone in this chamber still believes that Iran would never use such a weapon, [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3881.5s)]
*  I invite you to remember October 7th. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3887.5s)]
*  On that day we saw that Hamas was capable of... [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3891.5s)]
*  Everyone remember that day. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3895.5s)]
*  They did it with grenades. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3898.5s)]
*  They butchered families. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3901.5s)]
*  They burned children alive. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3903.5s)]
*  They mutilated women. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3905.5s)]
*  Remember October 7th. That's why we have to do what we have to do. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3907.5s)]
*  Remember October 7th. Remember the Holocaust. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3909.5s)]
*  That's why we have to do a Holocaust right now. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3911.5s)]
*  Every time, bro. Every time. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3913.5s)]
*  To that end, we uncovered intelligence revealing a multi-front plan [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3917.5s)]
*  directed by Iran, Hezbollah, and Hamas. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3921.5s)]
*  For a future assault on Israel. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3926.4s)]
*  This one would be far more sophisticated than October 7th. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3929.4s)]
*  It envisioned mass missile launches. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3933.4s)]
*  First from Iran, then from Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Yemen. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3937.4s)]
*  Followed by coordinated infiltrations of our borders. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3944.4s)]
*  The plan was not aspirational. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3949.4s)]
*  It was operational. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3952.4s)]
*  And it was nearing execution. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3955.3s)]
*  This council has convened countless times in recent months. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3960.3s)]
*  You have passed resolutions, called for restraint, demanded ceasefire. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3964.3s)]
*  You met in emergency sessions when Hamas was under threat. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3969.3s)]
*  But when Iran marched toward nuclear capability, you said nothing. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3973.3s)]
*  When they crossed line after line, you drew none of your own. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3979.3s)]
*  So we acted. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3984.2000000000003s)]
*  We acted to ensure our people live. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3986.2000000000003s)]
*  We acted so that Jewish children in Jerusalem will not wake up [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3989.2000000000003s)]
*  to the sound of air raid sirens triggered by a nuclear launch. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=3994.2000000000003s)]
*  We acted so that Iranian missiles will not carry radioactive payloads [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4000.2000000000003s)]
*  into civilian neighborhoods. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4007.2000000000003s)]
*  We acted because history has taught us silence is complicity [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4011.1s)]
*  and hesitation is fatal. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4021.1s)]
*  We acted because 80 years ago, the Jewish people made a promise to ourselves [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4026.1s)]
*  never again. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4036.0s)]
*  Hamas supplies to a nuclear holocaust as well. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4039.0s)]
*  This was an act of national preservation. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4043.0s)]
*  It was one we undertook alone. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4054.0s)]
*  Not because we wanted to, but because we were left no other option. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4059.0s)]
*  We now turn to this Council, not for permission, but for recognition. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4066.0s)]
*  Recognition that Israel did what the world should have done. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4072.0s)]
*  Recognition that the Iranian regime violated every obligation they ever undertook. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4076.0s)]
*  Recognition that Israel had the undeniable right to defend its people from extermination. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4081.0s)]
*  We urge the Council to condemn Iran's nuclear violations. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4089.0s)]
*  We urge the Council to finally acknowledge the existential threat Iran poses to the world. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4093.9s)]
*  We urge the Council to join us in our commitment to prevent their genocidal dreams [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4099.9s)]
*  from becoming a reality. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4105.9s)]
*  But we also expect something even more basic. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4108.9s)]
*  Moral clarity. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4111.9s)]
*  Stop equating aggressors with defenders. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4114.9s)]
*  Stop tweeting a genocidal regime and a democracy under siege as two sides of the same coin. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4117.799999999999s)]
*  The Iranian regime was preparing for war. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4128.799999999999s)]
*  This war would have stretched across the Middle East, to Europe, to Asia, to the Americas. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4132.799999999999s)]
*  It would have been against the international order. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4139.799999999999s)]
*  There we go, we're back. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4142.7s)]
*  I give the floor now to the representative of Iraq. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4144.7s)]
*  Man, shut up. I did that on purpose so the chat would no longer be delayed. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4157.7s)]
*  Shut up. Yes, I don't know how many times I have to describe to you guys that I'm literally hitting a refresh. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4162.7s)]
*  Iraq expresses its deep concern and condemnation of the dangerous military aggression [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4168.599999999999s)]
*  committed by the Israeli entity against the territories of the Islamic Republic of Iran, [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4174.599999999999s)]
*  including their blatant violation of Iraq's sovereignty and the inviolability of its airspace. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4180.599999999999s)]
*  We just heard that the Israeli representative addressing the UN Security Council [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4186.599999999999s)]
*  this evening on Israel's attack on Iran and their subsequent retaliation. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4192.5s)]
*  He began by saying as we speak, hundreds of ballistic missiles are striking Israel's cities, neighborhoods and communities. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4198.5s)]
*  They're striking population centers, not military bases, not air force bases. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4206.5s)]
*  And he ended by saying the Iranian... [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4212.5s)]
*  Oh my God, bro. Excuse me. Israel is using its civilian population as a human shield. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4215.4s)]
*  They literally are hitting the IDF headquarters. What the fuck are you talking about? [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4223.4s)]
*  It's a threat to the entire world. It acted because the UN Security Council didn't. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4227.4s)]
*  It acted because it waited for diplomacy to work. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4232.4s)]
*  And how long, he asked, did the world expect Israel to keep waiting? [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4236.4s)]
*  Hello, good evening. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4240.299999999999s)]
*  I think we have two speeches there from the Iranian representative, the head of delegation, the Israeli one. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4244.299999999999s)]
*  And we know this event is still fresh. It's less than 24 hours old. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4252.299999999999s)]
*  And there is no sign of any of the sides ready to climb down. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4258.299999999999s)]
*  I think the other head of delegations there, the ambassador, tried to de-escalate [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4262.299999999999s)]
*  or at least start talking about the escalation of something which is probably one of the most serious events [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4268.2s)]
*  in the Middle East for many decades. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4274.2s)]
*  And if it won't be de-escalated, then we might face weeks of this kind of exchange of attacks. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4277.2s)]
*  We see what Israel has done in the last less than 24 hours. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4286.2s)]
*  And also the retaliation from Iran that we saw buildings hit within the center of Israel. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4290.2s)]
*  At least 40 people injured, some of them critically. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4298.2s)]
*  And the question, yes, if you ask about the mood in Israel, whether I agree or not, [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4301.2s)]
*  is that, you know, and this is not new, in the last 20 plus years in Israel [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4307.2s)]
*  the general mood that Iran poses existential threat, especially if it possesses nuclear weapons [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4313.2s)]
*  and it was prepared to basically to this moment. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4320.2s)]
*  Some of us thought that the JCPOA actually worked and could avoid this. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4324.099999999999s)]
*  But now we are in the middle of this event and we need to see how it's going to evolve. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4330.099999999999s)]
*  How does it get de-escalated? [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4336.099999999999s)]
*  I think it's up to, again, we saw the United Nations, the United States, [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4341.099999999999s)]
*  its other forces, Russia and China, put pressure basically on both sides to ensure that this doesn't get out of hand. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4347.0s)]
*  The implications are not only for Iran and Israel, the implications are far beyond in the region internationally. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4355.0s)]
*  It affects the economy, it can deteriorate even to escalation in other places. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4363.0s)]
*  We all know that Iran is its weakest position as a result of what happened to the so-called axis of resistance. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4368.9s)]
*  But still, as we saw just in the last few hours, it can hit Israel. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4376.9s)]
*  And in Israel right now, many of the reports there, this was painful. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4382.9s)]
*  On the other hand, we said that Israel still is capable of keeping hitting Iran. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4389.9s)]
*  And if this escalates, it will get to a point of all-out war between two of the major powers in the region. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4395.799999999999s)]
*  Again, we have far-reaching implications to go well beyond this country. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4405.799999999999s)]
*  And this is for the international community, for region powers to put pressure. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4410.799999999999s)]
*  It's probably at least going to last another few days, but ensuring that it doesn't go beyond that. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4415.799999999999s)]
*  Israel says it's facing an existential threat, that it is forced to act against Iran. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4421.7s)]
*  If given the opportunity to use nukes, Iran would not nuke Israel. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4428.7s)]
*  Israel already has nukes, and it's not nuking Iran. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4434.7s)]
*  The entire purpose of nukes at this point, nuclear proliferation at this point, is for sovereignty. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4438.7s)]
*  Israel has nukes. Israel has the highest density of nukes per capita than any other country on the planet. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4444.599999999999s)]
*  Israel has the highest nukes per population density. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4454.599999999999s)]
*  Okay? [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4459.599999999999s)]
*  Iran will 100% use nukes on Israel? No, it wouldn't. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4461.599999999999s)]
*  No, it wouldn't. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4465.599999999999s)]
*  The idea that any country that has nukes is going to use it is so stupid. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4468.599999999999s)]
*  Deeply in a corruption trial, discredited because what happened in October 7, [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4473.5s)]
*  the inability to defend the people of Israel then, [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4479.5s)]
*  the hostages are still in Gaza. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4483.5s)]
*  Israel has nukes, why is it not using it in Iran? [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4486.5s)]
*  As a result, what happened in Gaza. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4489.5s)]
*  Useful information this morning. Iran has zero nuclear weapons. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4491.5s)]
*  Israel has up to 500 nuclear weapons. Iran has signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4495.5s)]
*  Israel refuses to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4500.4s)]
*  Iran has welcomed the IAEA International Observers to inspect its nuclear program. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4503.4s)]
*  Israel has IAEA oversight. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4508.4s)]
*  How far do you think that support is going to go? [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4511.4s)]
*  Because it's uncertain, isn't it, just how much President Donald Trump is in support of Prime Minister Netanyahu's aggression in the region. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4515.4s)]
*  You sound exactly like you sounded before the Russian invasion. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4522.4s)]
*  I think it's... [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4525.299999999999s)]
*  Dog. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4527.299999999999s)]
*  Israel has nukes. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4528.299999999999s)]
*  Up until this moment, it is yet to use nukes. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4530.299999999999s)]
*  The purpose of nukes is sovereignty and being a part of the mutually assured destruction policy. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4533.299999999999s)]
*  Israel would not be able to nuke Iran or even strike Iran in the way that it did if Iran actually had nukes by now. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4540.299999999999s)]
*  The only country on the planet that has deployed a nuke on a civilian population with a state that it was in war with is the United States of America. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4547.2s)]
*  No other country has ever before or after deployed nuclear weapons. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4560.2s)]
*  That's it. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4566.2s)]
*  If there is one country that has a ton of nukes that have actually shown their interest in using it, it's us. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4568.2s)]
*  Israel... [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4576.099999999999s)]
*  Oh, AP has a new death count for Israelis? [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4577.099999999999s)]
*  No, Israel hit by missiles. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4579.099999999999s)]
*  They only showed the Iranian death count, which is 78. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4581.099999999999s)]
*  The ambassador says 78 people were killed and over 320 injured in the Israeli attacks. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4588.099999999999s)]
*  This is in Iran. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4593.099999999999s)]
*  How long do you think these attacks from Israel will last? [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4595.099999999999s)]
*  I mean, America is backing Israel, so it just entirely depends on what kind of runway America has. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4599.099999999999s)]
*  To continue pummeling Iran. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4605.0s)]
*  That's what it's about here. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4607.0s)]
*  You hit it, you had evidence of it, you knew it was coming, and so you jumped ahead of that attack. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4609.0s)]
*  By the way, as we're speaking, as there is the next... [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4614.0s)]
*  I thought that there was another salvo of Iranian attacks that were expected in Israel. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4618.0s)]
*  I don't know how many hours it's going to take. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4624.0s)]
*  Barrage two and three. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4626.0s)]
*  They haven't reached Israel yet. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4630.0s)]
*  In fact, the Israelis in 1967, that's the classic... [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4631.9s)]
*  Iran has been getting bombed. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4637.9s)]
*  Iran's been getting bombed by Israel already. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4641.9s)]
*  But in international law and international tradition, you always want to say that you're preempting, because that's the much more acceptable... [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4644.9s)]
*  Yes, also the courts sided with the Trump administration in keeping Mahmoud Khalil detained. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4650.9s)]
*  Courts sided with last minute Trump admin effort to deny Mahmoud Khalil's release. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4657.799999999999s)]
*  Admin argued he could be detained for a frivolous charge they gave him after his arrest, and the judge agreed. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4660.799999999999s)]
*  I covered this earlier, or I tweeted about this in the morning. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4665.799999999999s)]
*  The post hoc claim that the admin slapped on here is that Mahmoud was a part of student organizing and worked at UNRWA, [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4670.799999999999s)]
*  and didn't disclose his while getting his green card. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4676.799999999999s)]
*  Neither of these things would have stopped him from receiving his legal permanent residency status. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4678.799999999999s)]
*  And they added it after the fact to continue his detention. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4682.799999999999s)]
*  The administration is actively doing the arrest first and then sorted out later policies here. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4687.799999999999s)]
*  A nation missile program that could be an ICBM program eventually. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4693.799999999999s)]
*  They still had nuclear scientists that they were not allowing for inspectors to have access to. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4697.799999999999s)]
*  Oh, they're showing the Iran. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4703.799999999999s)]
*  The Israeli officials say the IDF damaged a key nuclear facility early this morning. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4705.799999999999s)]
*  Oh wait, never mind, they're not showing it anymore. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4710.799999999999s)]

*  Just one day after the strikes targeted Iran's nuclear sites and military command, [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4721.7s)]
*  Israeli army radio has confirmed that Israel is once again striking targets inside of Iran. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4725.7s)]

*  I find it strange that you would not tell anyone in fact that Iran is Hamas. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4779.599999999999s)]
*  No, no, Iran itself. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4783.599999999999s)]
*  Iran itself is even more. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4785.599999999999s)]
*  Iran itself is more Hamas than Hamas. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4789.599999999999s)]
*  Iran is the ultimate Hamas. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4792.599999999999s)]
*  So you don't have to say Iran is Hamas. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4794.599999999999s)]
*  You can simply say Iran is all of it. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4797.599999999999s)]
*  Hamas is Iran, if anything. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4801.599999999999s)]
*  Remember, Iran in and of itself is the ultimate enemy here in the eyes of the Western world. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4803.599999999999s)]
*  Well, right now, maybe it may be more defined, but ultimately the goal, I think, for Israel [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4812.599999999999s)]
*  and I think for the United States as well is to present Iranian leaders with a choice. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4818.599999999999s)]
*  Either they remain in power or they give up their enrichment facilities. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4822.599999999999s)]
*  You can't have both ways. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4826.599999999999s)]
*  And I think we are, today was a first good step toward realizing that goal. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4828.5s)]
*  Oh, Michael, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirms more retaliatory attacks are coming to Iran. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4834.5s)]
*  European leaders are calling for a de-escalation between the two countries. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4840.5s)]
*  Is that possible at this point? [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4844.5s)]
*  It would be possible. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4846.5s)]
*  I don't think it's likely. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4848.5s)]
*  I think Israel has opened a corridor from Western Iran into central Iran. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4850.5s)]
*  The goal of many of the bombing raids today was to eliminate all of Iran's anti-aerial defense systems [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4854.4s)]
*  and Israel now operates almost with impunity against these targets. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4860.4s)]
*  Israel has a tremendous advantage. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4865.4s)]
*  And this is not just about the nuclear program. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4867.4s)]
*  To keep in mind that this is a regime which for the last 46 years has pledged weekly, if not daily, to destroy us [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4869.4s)]
*  and has not just said those words, has acted on it. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4875.4s)]
*  It has killed thousands of Israelis directly or through its proxies, through terrorist acts [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4879.4s)]
*  both in Israel and against Israeli and Jewish targets abroad. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4883.299999999999s)]
*  This is a regime that's deeply, deeply committed to our destruction. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4886.299999999999s)]
*  And Israel has, of course, every right and indeed a duty to defend ourselves against this threat. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4890.299999999999s)]
*  And I think that at this point, having really displayed tremendous forbearance over the years vis-a-vis Iran, [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4895.299999999999s)]
*  there's an opportunity now to make a regional change. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4903.299999999999s)]
*  The stakes here, Morgan, is really truly a Middle East, a new Middle East, [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4905.299999999999s)]
*  where Israel could have peace with Lebanon, peace with Syria, peace with Saudi Arabia. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4909.2s)]
*  I hear some people making fun of his naturally occurring Levant, Levantine accent. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4913.2s)]
*  Excuse me. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4921.2s)]
*  That's racist and anti-Semitic. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4923.2s)]
*  This is an organic accent that you can find in the MENA region and in the Levant in particular. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4925.2s)]
*  Well, it's not just the Iron Dome, as I mentioned, it's these other systems as well. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4935.099999999999s)]
*  And who knows, maybe the United States is contributing too. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4939.099999999999s)]
*  They have three very advanced systems, the Aegis system, the Patriot system, and the THAAD system, [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4941.099999999999s)]
*  as well as American aircraft that shoot down drones and shoot down rockets. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4946.099999999999s)]
*  It is pretty crazy though, like, the major media is just full-tilt, like, [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4950.099999999999s)]
*  Israel has a right to defend itself, Israel was unjustifiably attacked. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4954.099999999999s)]
*  It's like, Israel is the one who attacked Iran. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4957.099999999999s)]
*  They killed all, they have like 400 casualties in the last year. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4960.099999999999s)]
*  They killed almost 100 people. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4965.099999999999s)]
*  And it's so wild, like, they're making it seem as though even when Israel attacks, Israel's still the victim. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4967.099999999999s)]
*  That's not enough just to take down my building, it's enough to take down my neighborhood. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4973.099999999999s)]
*  So I am confident, but I'm not calm. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4978.099999999999s)]
*  Confident, but not calm. Michael Oren, thank you for joining us. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4982.099999999999s)]
*  Thank you very much, Morgan. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4986.099999999999s)]
*  And we'll have much more breaking news coverage just ahead. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4988.099999999999s)]
*  Hassan not even commenting that America is the one actively destroying the Middle East. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4990.099999999999s)]
*  This is lazy commentary. You're right. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4995.099999999999s)]
*  I've been repeating it over and over again. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=4997.099999999999s)]
*  And you're right. It bears repeating once again. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5000.099999999999s)]
*  This is not just Israel destroying the Middle East. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5002.099999999999s)]
*  It is America destroying the Middle East. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5006.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. What do you expect when these are the commentators? [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5009.099999999999s)]
*  CNN's diverse table of commentators tonight. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5012.099999999999s)]
*  Danny Dunn on my Jonathan conk uncrease retired lieutenant lieutenant colonel Jonathan conk uncrease. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5015.099999999999s)]
*  Almost Yadlin former head of Israeli military intelligence. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5025.099999999999s)]
*  Danny Dunn on again. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5028.099999999999s)]
*  These get more play and more airtime on US news than they do in Israeli television, dude. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5030.099999999999s)]
*  Immediately the permanent contextualization begins, you know. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5037.099999999999s)]
*  Iran last night. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5043.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Jake, and it was in the early morning hours of this morning in the overnight hours that people in Iran started telling us that they were hearing loud explosions in Tehran. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5046.099999999999s)]
*  It really seems as though the first wave of these attacks that the Israelis carried out, most of them were actually apparently carried out by F 35 jets with obviously stealth capabilities. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5055.099999999999s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5065.099999999999s)]
*  For the Iranian air defenses to detect those jets. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5067.099999999999s)]
*  But another thing that we've also since learned from the Israelis is that they apparently had Mossad operatives on the ground clandestinely acting there and essentially putting together an entire drone base or drone bases with which they then attacked some of these Iranian air defenses. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5069.099999999999s)]
*  Wait, you think they actually successfully took down F 35s then? [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5084.0s)]
*  Holy shit. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5088.0s)]
*  The Israelis later came out and they showed some footage allegedly showing these operatives on the ground operating somewhere south of Tehran near an Iranian base and allegedly taking out an Iranian missile system but also taking out an air defense system of the Iranians as well. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5090.0s)]
*  F 35s are so fucking ass. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5106.0s)]
*  How is the latest gen fighter so ass? [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5108.0s)]
*  How can it be taken out already? [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5111.9s)]
*  Like I said, when I saw, when I heard one of hundreds of F 35s, no, no, no, no. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5113.9s)]
*  There is no world where any F 35 should be getting taken out. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5122.9s)]
*  Like not even one. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5126.9s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5128.9s)]
*  It's the entire purpose of the next generation. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5130.9s)]
*  It's the whole point. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5132.9s)]
*  It's the whole point. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5134.9s)]
*  It's supposed to not be targeted by existing defense weapons chatters. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5136.799999999999s)]
*  Why do you think they go, this is the fifth generation fighting jet? [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5144.799999999999s)]
*  The whole purpose of the generation is so that none of the existing targeting systems are capable of bringing it down. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5148.799999999999s)]
*  It's supposed to be air superiority, air to air combat superiority and also air superiority over surface to air missiles. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5158.7s)]
*  If Iran is of taking down the F 35s, this soon after its utilization, it's over. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5167.7s)]
*  There is no fucking air superiority. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5176.7s)]
*  Superiority does not equal invincibility. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5178.7s)]
*  That's not what I mean. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5181.7s)]
*  I don't believe that. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5183.7s)]
*  The wrong F 35 system was built to be cheaper than the F 22 while remaining passable. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5185.599999999999s)]
*  It's like, I was already shocked. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5189.599999999999s)]
*  It was already shocking enough when I found out that the New York Times reporting showed that even the Houthis were able to strike near an F 35 and almost take one down. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5192.599999999999s)]
*  That's incredible. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5203.599999999999s)]
*  That was an incredible admission. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5205.599999999999s)]
*  That means that Russia, China and Iran can, you know, take out F 35s. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5207.599999999999s)]
*  It's nothing. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5213.5s)]
*  The Iraqis, excuse me, the Iranians have refused to attend the sessions scheduled for this weekend in Oman. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5215.5s)]
*  And so now we're back into potentially a regional conflict of war which is going to be very difficult to end. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5223.5s)]
*  Well, you said that President Trump was pushing this negotiation, this process to stop Iran's nuclear weapons program. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5233.5s)]
*  Axios reports that a couple Israeli officials told them that Israel had a clear U.S. green light to attack Iran and that Trump's statements expressing concern about a potential strike was basically part of a deception campaign to lull the Iranians into a false sense of security. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5242.4s)]
*  Do you not believe that? [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5263.4s)]
*  Well, I think there's a great deal of confusion about what the President was up to, but he was publicly saying that there should be time for further negotiations. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5265.299999999999s)]
*  What is this audio, man? [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5277.299999999999s)]
*  We scheduled another meeting with our special envoy Sunday in Oman. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5279.299999999999s)]
*  We were still prepared to go. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5283.299999999999s)]
*  So I don't think this was part of a deception activity. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5286.299999999999s)]
*  I think this was generally on the part of the United States an attempt to see if there was a way forward diplomatically. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5291.2s)]
*  At this point now, I think they might be revising the story, suggesting that, oh, we were with you all the time and this is a great victory. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5299.2s)]
*  Not unusual for the President to seize on someone else's victory and claim it as his own. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5311.2s)]
*  So I know you don't approve, obviously, of the Israeli strikes against Iran last night. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5318.099999999999s)]
*  There are voices out there, both on the left and right, that say that the United States should not be participating in the defense of Israel. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5324.099999999999s)]
*  As you know, the U.S. military has confirmed that they are helping Israel's missile defense, not the offensive strikes against Iran, but trying to stop the Iranian missiles before they hit Israel. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5333.099999999999s)]
*  Do you think that the U.S. should stop helping Israel when it comes to missile defense? [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5344.0s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5349.0s)]
*  I think the integration of the U.S. forces, we have our destroyer now off the coast in the Mediterranean to integrate our Aegis fires with their fires, is that I think we have a solid obligation to defend the people of Israel. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5352.0s)]
*  I think at the same time, we have an obligation to speak, as they say, truth to power. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5368.9s)]
*  If we object to some of their approaches and tactics, we have to make that clear. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5375.9s)]
*  That's what I've tried to do. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5379.9s)]
*  But no, we have to defend the state of Israel. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5381.9s)]
*  Well, let me just ask you a hypothetical. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5384.9s)]
*  If Mexico had said that its goal was to rid the world of the United States, and they had a nuclear weapons program, and the CIA believed that it was within a year of weaponizing enriched uranium and putting it on a ballistic missile capable of killing Americans, do you think the United States would hesitate to do what Israel just did? [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5386.799999999999s)]
*  I don't think any would, but I think the hypothetical is concrete to any of the things that they've said. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5410.799999999999s)]
*  These gays are a fucking animal. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5414.7s)]
*  How is this any different than what Marjorie Taylor Greene says? [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5416.7s)]
*  This is literally developing justification for why Israel was allowed, why Israel should be allowed to fucking strike Iran. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5420.7s)]
*  And also simultaneously, once again, uniparty, uniparty, uniparty, American foreign policy is uniparty. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5428.7s)]
*  The mainstream media's sole purpose here is to justify American foreign policy. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5433.7s)]
*  Israel's actions are not outside of the boundaries of what America wanted. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5440.599999999999s)]
*  It is exactly what America wanted. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5444.599999999999s)]
*  This right here is manufacturing consent. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5446.599999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5448.599999999999s)]
*  These guys are not even hitting the anti-Trump slant. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5450.599999999999s)]
*  Notice how they are not hitting the anti-Trump slant. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5452.599999999999s)]
*  Fake WMD allegations, this time nukes. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5454.599999999999s)]
*  Israel agitating to go to war, begging to go to war. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5460.599999999999s)]
*  The mainstream outlets in unison saying the exact same things. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5464.599999999999s)]
*  Welcome back, 2001. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5468.5s)]
*  We are so back. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5470.5s)]
*  Welcome back, 2003. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5472.5s)]
*  We are back, baby. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5474.5s)]
*  Fake WMD justifications, war with Iran. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5476.5s)]
*  We are so fucking back. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5480.5s)]
*  The media is unified and supporting military conquests in the region. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5482.5s)]
*  I'm telling you, this is exactly like the Iraq War. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5488.5s)]
*  We are back to the Iraq War days, dude. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5492.5s)]
*  Make no mistake, if you cannot fucking see this, if you cannot recognize exactly what's happening here, [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5496.4s)]
*  I don't know what to tell you. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5502.4s)]
*  Oh, it's a dangerous regime. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5504.4s)]
*  Even if they didn't have nukes, it's good to decapitate the regime. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5506.4s)]
*  We have to do regime change. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5510.4s)]
*  It is literally the same shit. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5512.4s)]
*  And ten years down the line, a lot of fucking libshits will turn around and be like, [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5514.4s)]
*  Oh, how are we duped? Oh, I can't believe it. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5519.4s)]
*  While they salivated at the prospect of sending American troops into the region to defend Israel. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5521.299999999999s)]
*  Okay, to defend Israel's interest, to defend America's interest, [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5528.299999999999s)]
*  to wage war with a foreign sovereign nation, a regional power. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5532.299999999999s)]
*  Holy shit, dude. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5538.299999999999s)]
*  It is literally the same. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5540.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Johnny Harris will make a video about this five years later. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5542.299999999999s)]
*  They'll be like, how could we have been so duped? [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5546.299999999999s)]
*  How could we have been so duped? [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5548.299999999999s)]
*  Hmm, I wonder how. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5550.2s)]
*  Perhaps it is because we are salivating at the prospect and mainstream media is playing its fucking role. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5552.2s)]
*  Its role is to agitate, its role is to manufacture consent for this war. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5558.2s)]
*  It turns out that the American task force that DropSite News intercepted and revealed is already in play here. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5563.2s)]
*  You are watching it unfold. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5573.2s)]
*  Altitudes. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5575.099999999999s)]
*  Also, there were two US Navy destroyers in the eastern Mediterranean that were already deployed there. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5577.099999999999s)]
*  And they both are equipped with missile defense systems that are capable of also bringing down long range ballistic missiles. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5581.099999999999s)]
*  Now, this is exactly what happened last year when Iran launched those barrages against Israel. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5588.099999999999s)]
*  Those Navy ships that were there at the time were able to intercept some of those incoming Iranian missiles. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5593.099999999999s)]
*  So that's what we know right now. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5599.099999999999s)]
*  We're working to get confirmation that that is exactly the case in regards to the FAD missile system. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5601.0s)]
*  But more than likely that is what happened because there are two of those systems inside of Israel right now. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5607.0s)]
*  Louis, hang with me for a second because I want to go to Matthew because we're going to stay in this lane of just interception and defense. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5612.0s)]
*  Matthew, what do we know about the Iron Dome and its capabilities in deterring these kinds of strikes? [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5617.0s)]
*  Just a second ago we were seeing this video that looks to be that Iron Dome in action. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5623.0s)]
*  You see that explosion, you see the missile, but how does this work and how much longer can it hold up with all of these missiles coming in? [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5628.9s)]
*  Great question. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5637.9s)]
*  Sure, great question. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5639.9s)]
*  I don't have a lot of technical insight into the current status of Iron Dome. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5641.9s)]
*  It's a system that has been wildly effective for many years. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5649.9s)]
*  The Iranians so far have fired off fewer rockets than they did the last time we had this kind of exchange, which could be, they want to keep something in the tank depending on how long this goes. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5653.799999999999s)]
*  But as good as the Iron Dome has been, obviously it's got some vulnerabilities. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5665.799999999999s)]
*  It's not going to be 100% effective. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5673.799999999999s)]
*  I'm not sure it's realistic to expect something like that. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5676.799999999999s)]
*  Some missiles have gotten through, some more missiles are going to get through. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5679.7s)]
*  But as far as sustainability goes, I think there starts to be a resource stress in that system. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5683.7s)]
*  I think you'll see the US step in with whatever it can to bear it up or to complement it with some of the other systems that Luis was just talking about. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5689.7s)]
*  Absolutely. Marcus, let me bring you in here because what are you hearing from Israeli officials and what might come next within the next few hours? [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5697.7s)]
*  Please, 22 people arrested on suspicion of planning to take out a congradulatory convoy of vehicles in Umm al-Fam in solidarity with the rocket barrage towards Israel tonight. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5705.599999999999s)]
*  Nice democracy, man. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5713.599999999999s)]
*  They have said that the airstrikes that they started on Iran earlier this morning, that it would have multiple phases and that this wasn't the end of that. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5715.599999999999s)]
*  We anticipate that Israel might launch another strike or multiple strikes in Iran. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5727.5s)]
*  We'll have to wait to see if indeed that happens. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5733.5s)]
*  And one thing is certain, they have said that they expect more from Iran. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5736.5s)]
*  So we anticipate that this is far from over. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5742.5s)]
*  Israel is preparing for that and one of the things they told the public is for the public to be prepared. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5747.5s)]
*  The prime minister said that they anticipate that Iran's retaliation will include quote severe waves of airstrikes and that's a bit of what we have seen tonight here in Tel Aviv, Morgan. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5753.4s)]
*  Yeah, and certainly some scary hours ahead. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5765.4s)]
*  Selena, the president told you yesterday that an attack on Iran could very well happen, but that he didn't think it was imminent. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5767.4s)]
*  Do we know when the White House learned of Israel's decision to strike Iran early this morning, local time, kind of rewind and take us through how we got here in the first place? [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5773.4s)]
*  Yeah, Morgan, well we know that the U.S. was aware. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5783.4s)]
*  We don't know the exact timing before the attack. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5785.4s)]
*  The U.S. had already started to pull some personnel from the Middle East. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5787.4s)]
*  The president had said days before that the region could become very dangerous, but that's right. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5791.4s)]
*  Yesterday I asked the president just how imminent this attack could be and the president said he didn't think it was imminent, but that it very well could happen. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5796.4s)]
*  Yeah, by the way, it's like Israel is currently striking Tehran. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5804.4s)]
*  The difference between last night and right now, however, is that the anti-air missiles are working now. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5811.299999999999s)]
*  The anti-air defense systems are now working, at least the ones that haven't been fucking destroyed by drone strikes. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5823.299999999999s)]
*  And of course, the media is not even fucking covering it. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5829.299999999999s)]
*  The media is not covering it at all. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5832.299999999999s)]
*  There has been no mention thus far of the Israeli retaliation because we're too busy manufacturing consent for how we must defend Israel, [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5834.2s)]
*  why we must defend Israel, how Israel is the biggest victim in all of this, and how, you know, we have to go to war with Iran. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5842.2s)]
*  They just, you know, this is Israel did the right thing here. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5850.2s)]
*  Who wouldn't have actually struck Iran? [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5852.2s)]
*  We should have struck Iran before this. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5855.2s)]
*  Iran's in Tehran, including one with a Houthi banner applaud and cheer as they watch Iranian air defenses fend off Israeli attacks in the sky tonight. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5857.2s)]
*  Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar! [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5863.099999999999s)]
*  Do you think this will spiral out of control? [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5888.099999999999s)]
*  What do you mean? It is already spiraled out of control. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5891.0s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5894.0s)]
*  Israel has officially announced, Israel's officially announced its final ambition. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5896.0s)]
*  This is the crown jewel. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5904.0s)]
*  Iran has always been the biggest ambition for Israel. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5906.0s)]
*  It's the most powerful regional power against Israel. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5912.0s)]
*  And now, right at the precipice of the Knesset dissolving, like the controlling, [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5915.9s)]
*  the controlling parties basically falling apart and ripping Benjamin Netanyahu away from power and potentially destabilizing Israeli politics for a little bit. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5921.9s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu had to strike at the last moment that he could to kickstart the final conquest, [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5933.9s)]
*  the final ambition, the final solution to the Arab problem in the Arab Peninsula. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5941.799999999999s)]
*  The Muslim problem. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=5949.799999999999s)]

*  Typically you would not hear something like this from Iran, but in this case the information is being made public probably just because... [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=6087.299999999999s)]

*  The people that voted for Donald Trump started realizing that maybe this isn't the best possible thing to do. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=6673.7s)]
*  Maybe we're not going after the rapist criminal migrants. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=6678.599999999999s)]
*  And the same goes for a war with Iran. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=6682.7s)]
*  Okay. Americans do not have any appetite for a war with Iran. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=6687.599999999999s)]
*  They do not. Right now, it's like 12%. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=6692.2s)]
*  It's a 90-10 issue. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=6696.4s)]
*  Republicans do not have an appetite to go to war with Iran. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=6698.9s)]
*  This is especially because of the way that they are framing this as like a defense of Israel, [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=6702.8s)]
*  even though it's technically America's own ambition in the region. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=6708.6s)]
*  Americans do not want to go to war with Iran. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=6713.1s)]
*  So in the absence of a 9-11 style situation that universalizes the pain and makes every American fearful of like Iran, [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=6715.6s)]
*  there will be no justification to go to war with Iran. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=6724.7s)]
*  And Donald Trump's already lowering approval rating will be in the fucking shitter [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=6729.1s)]
*  as opposed to George W. Bush having a high approval rating in the aftermath of 9-11, [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=6735.400000000001s)]

*  Another call to tell me that another friend of mine was killed in battle. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=6744.1s)]

*  I'm 23 and they're even younger than me. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=6764.9s)]

*  No, no, not the Nazis that wanted to fucking do a genocide. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=6787.599999999999s)]
*  Not the 23-year-old kids who joined the Nazi forces to do a genocide in fucking Gaza [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=6794.7s)]
*  or to do unlimited death and destruction in Lebanon, getting killed in the process. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=6803.7s)]
*  What the fuck? The horror. The horror. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=6809.6s)]
*  Why won't anybody think about the 25-year-old rear admiral general that died [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=6813.4s)]
*  because he was dressed up, died after invading the homes of Lebanese women [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=6819.6s)]
*  that they had massacred, wearing their underwear, as Hezbollah sniped them [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=6824.7s)]
*  because they love standing next to window stills while smoking cigarettes. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=6830.7s)]
*  Think about these brave, beautiful 25-year-old commando admiral generals [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=6834.8s)]
*  that are children and also hostages. Why? [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=6842.5s)]
*  This was an innocent child general of the Israeli Nazi force. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=6847.1s)]
*  That's crazy. I am so sad. I am saddened. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=6851.8s)]
*  Yeah, you all laugh. You all laugh. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=6856.6s)]

*  a tank that just got done crushing the skulls of Palestinian orphans? [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=6871.200000000001s)]
*  Will you laugh? Kahlil, no! That's what I say. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=6875.6s)]
*  Not so funny, is it? When you think about a general that was kidnapped from a tank, [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=6879.400000000001s)]
*  a poor hostage. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=6888.1s)]

*  but then he realized that there would be a process of discovery where the courts would have access to his... [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=6955.3s)]
*  Well, I mean videos that he's posted while also access to his hard drives, [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=6962.5s)]

*  And Iran now says it will not join nuclear talks set for this Sunday, [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=6993.2s)]
*  but Steve Witkoff, President Trump's Mideast envoy, is still expected to go to Oman, at least for now. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=6997.099999999999s)]
*  Iran's supreme leader has vowed severe punishment and its military said that Iran would exact a heavy price on Israel [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7003.0s)]

*  Biker broadcasting service Israeli military put out a statement just a few moments ago saying the IDF identified missiles launched from Iran toward the territory of the state of Israel. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7333.6s)]
*  Sirens were going off in Jerusalem behind us. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7343.8s)]
*  I don't know if Mike is picking up on it, but it sounds like those sirens were so loud. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7346.7s)]
*  They set off car alarms in the area and even after they stopped here for a moment, you can hear them in neighboring towns. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7349.9s)]
*  This is the area you should avoid course of the past probably two minutes or so. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7356.6s)]
*  God damn like four or five almost the entire year exceptions, but also possibly inner. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7360.8s)]
*  So but also possibly impacts. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7366.3s)]
*  We're not sure about that yet. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7368.8s)]
*  And as I sit here talking to you the red alerts keep coming in for areas all around Jerusalem. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7370.7s)]
*  Shoresh for example is just west of us a number of other locations in the area. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7376.9s)]
*  So this appears to be from what we're seeing here the third round of Iranian ballistic missile fire incoming at Israel again. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7384.0s)]
*  The sirens went off here for quite some time and then they continued in areas around Jerusalem and we heard a number of intersips. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7392.1s)]
*  Let me stop talking for just a minute here. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7398.6s)]
*  I doubt the microphone can pick it up, but I can hear red alert sirens in the distance. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7403.1s)]
*  Essentially west of where we're sitting right now that is towards Tel Aviv. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7409.0s)]
*  And it looks like sirens or red alerts are also going off in the West Bank in places like Shilo as well. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7415.0s)]
*  So it's not clear if this is all across the country, but it certainly looks like it is around Jerusalem and potentially central parts of the country as well with what is the third round of incoming ballistic missile fire. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7420.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, my cameraman here looking behind me. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7433.299999999999s)]
*  Are you seeing? [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7437.8s)]
*  Yeah, we're seeing it. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7442.3s)]
*  We're seeing a flame of some sort behind us, whether that's a down. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7443.0s)]
*  So yeah, we're seeing some images right now from Jerusalem and also some from tell them that's Tel Aviv right now. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7446.2s)]
*  We're seeing images and and what for folks not used to seeing this. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7451.5s)]
*  Some of them are missiles and some of them are just so hard right behind us. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7455.900000000001s)]
*  Anti missiles. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7459.5s)]
*  Yeah, we just heard you might even still be able to hear it in the background. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7460.900000000001s)]
*  We just saw an interceptor launched off from pretty much right behind us that was headed up right behind our shot here. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7463.8s)]
*  We might be able to roll that back a little later, but I think that's the first time at least interceptor fired from most of the incoming had been towards Tel Aviv, some towards northern Israel. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7470.099999999999s)]
*  But now it seems this missile fire at least a portion of it headed towards Jerusalem itself obviously goes without saying this is where the Prime Minister's office is. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7482.8s)]
*  This is where the Knesset is. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7490.9s)]
*  No, not the Prime Minister's office. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7492.9s)]
*  And as I say this just heard what sounded like an interception might have been able to see it over my left shoulder here. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7494.799999999999s)]
*  Another one potentially a third one. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7501.9s)]
*  So this looks like and I'm still hearing them. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7504.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the flashes in the sky for those watching the flash. [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7507.599999999999s)]
*  This guy, this sounds like our missiles being exploded by the interceptors when they when the missiles get through the flashes are on the ground when the missiles hit. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7510.4s)]
*  It is quite a thing to be in Israel prayers for Scott Jennings, which is not in Jennings who is in Jerusalem for some weird reason. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7521.6s)]

*  While they were under attack? [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7548.7s)]
*  We see more behind us as well. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7549.8s)]

*  We have obviously we have a diplomatic presence. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7589.0s)]

*  We have a THAAD system, a terminal high altitude area area defense system. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7593.8s)]
*  That system is a missile defense system. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7598.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, why? [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7600.0s)]
*  Why? [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7600.5s)]
*  Why do we have that there? [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7600.8s)]
*  We should have that there. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7601.900000000001s)]
*  We know already that the military equipment that the Israelis use in their defense is paid for by US taxpayers to the tune of billions annually. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7603.1s)]
*  But now we know in terms of positioning assets as well as the existing assets of the US military in the region that there has been at least some role played by the US military. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7613.6s)]
*  With regard to having the ability to defend Israel against some of these Iranian attacks. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7626.200000000001s)]
*  What we're being told is not only are two destroyers that are capable of deflecting both cruise and ballistic missiles headed towards the Eastern Mediterranean, [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7632.2s)]
*  but we know already in the presence in the region is the USS Sullivan, the USS Ashley Burke. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7644.0s)]
*  And we also know that there is in fact a number of other naval vessels as well. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7650.8s)]
*  According to the US Navy, the USS Carl Vinson is in the Arabian Sea. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7658.8s)]
*  And that's important to note because that is a ship that is there well off the coast of Oman because there is a need with those potential for talks in Oman, those indirect talks, a sixth round. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7662.7s)]
*  That that was something that was necessary for the commander in chief to US president to make sure was there. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7676.3s)]
*  And finally, we should also tell you that according to what we've been hearing here in Washington, [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7683.1s)]
*  the US Army has also employed the THAAD missile defense system again in an effort to try and defend Israel against the attacks, [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7688.3s)]
*  the retaliatory attacks, which we understand has been in three waves of missiles from Iran. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7698.0s)]
*  Very interesting indeed. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7704.0s)]
*  Okay, Kimberly Harkett bringing us the latest there, reminding us that the US THAAD missile system is being deployed also in Israel as well as the... [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7705.3s)]
*  Wait, I thought we weren't defending Israel. I thought we weren't collaborating with Israel. What's going on? [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7714.3s)]
*  I'm hearing reports that American THAAD missile systems are defending the genocidal Nazi state. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7720.1s)]
*  Strange developments all around. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7731.9s)]

*  Outside the Natanz site has remained unchanged. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7748.4s)]
*  USS Ashley Babbitt and USS Berger has moved in the direction of Israel in an effort to defend it. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7754.2s)]
*  USS Ashley Babbitt. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7766.2s)]
*  USS Kyle Rittenhouse. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7769.0s)]

*  Meanwhile, the US has warned Iran that it should not target American infrastructure in the region. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7789.0s)]
*  The United States was informed of the strikes ahead of time, but was not militarily involved in these strikes. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7796.5s)]

*  Are the super fast ones the Khyber missiles that they were talking about? [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7815.3s)]
*  Because maybe Iran isn't wrong and it is actually shockingly fast. [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7819.3s)]
*  I need all the missile autists to come to the front. Stand up. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7823.1s)]
*  Wait, oh, what the fuck? Oh, that one hit. That was we just saw that one that that hit, right? [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7830.1s)]
*  That's I saw that up up top right corner in the region. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7837.900000000001s)]
*  Or these are the consequences for Iran would be dire. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7842.1s)]
*  Well, Gavir Huzzonde is at the UN headquarters in New York. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7846.900000000001s)]
*  And Gabe, what more have we heard from the UN there tonight? [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7850.0s)]
*  Yeah, that meeting from the Security Council lasted about two and a half hours. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7852.9s)]
*  We heard from the two main players. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7857.5s)]
*  Let's get to that straight away. Iran and Israel, the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations, [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7859.5s)]
*  calling Israel's attack on his country and his words barbaric, criminal and essentially an act of war. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7865.7s)]
*  He went on to say that the killing of military personnel and others in Iran were targeted assassinations. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7872.299999999999s)]
*  And he said Iran will reserve the right and does reserve the right to respond even more at the time and place of its choosing. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7881.5s)]
*  But said it will do it in the context of self-defense. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7890.099999999999s)]
*  Now, Israel's ambassador to the UN basically laid out the case in his view and in his country's view that they were taking action in his view of self-preservation for the Israeli states, [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7894.099999999999s)]
*  claiming that they uncovered plans for Iran to strike Israel and also said that his country waited for diplomacy to try to work, [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7905.6s)]
*  but they could not wait any longer. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7918.0s)]
*  Of course, this flies in the face of the fact that there were talks scheduled, as Kimberly Halkett mentioned, [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7919.8s)]
*  this weekend between Iran and the United States. Those talks now very much in doubt, to put it mildly. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7926.6s)]
*  Just briefly though, I'll also mention several other Security Council members spoke. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7933.3s)]
*  Pakistan's ambassador said that Israel's attack on Iran was morally repugnant ahead of the Iran nuclear talks over the weekend. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7938.6s)]
*  China urged Israel to immediately cease all of its, in their words, military adventurism. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7948.2s)]
*  And Russia's ambassador to the UN also condemned Israel's actions as well. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7955.8s)]
*  That's old footage. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7963.0s)]
*  Well, sheltering underground, large explosions throughout the Tel Aviv suburbs. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7970.0s)]
*  It was a Kaibarsh Akhan missile hitting Tel Aviv moments ago. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7981.799999999999s)]
*  There was something actually that the Iranian ambassador brought up saying that the United States is directly involved in this [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=7993.0s)]
*  because of Israel's use of American weapons. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8000.799999999999s)]
*  And he said that's something that Iran will not forget and really pointed the finger at the United States. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8004.799999999999s)]
*  But clearly, for the most part, the world really points the finger at Israel for starting this. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8010.799999999999s)]
*  And that's why we saw so many condemnations of Israel's actions. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8019.400000000001s)]
*  But now you're sensing, at least on the Security Council, everyone saying take a step back because this could escalate. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8023.0s)]
*  A map posted by Israel Defense Forces currently shows Jammu and Kashmir as part of Pakistan. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8031.0s)]
*  A map of India is wrong. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8038.0s)]
*  Now you understand why India remains neutral. [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8040.0s)]
*  Not much we agree on, but very forward thinking to correctly show Jammu and Kashmir as a part of Pakistan. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8043.7s)]
*  India no longer lying in defense of Israel. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8056.7s)]
*  Another round of nuclear talks between the United States and Iran were scheduled to take place. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8073.7s)]
*  US Marine deployed to Los Angeles carried out the first known detention of a civilian. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8078.7s)]
*  This served multiple purposes, if you will, for Israel. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8081.7s)]
*  As the Israeli ambassador said, it took out military leaders, military infrastructure, and the core of the nuclear program of Iran, [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8085.7s)]
*  according to the Israeli ambassador. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8093.7s)]
*  But it also potentially now derails. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8095.7s)]
*  I call on everyone to join me in unison to demand that Caitlyn Jenner drive around the streets of Tel Aviv right now. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8099.4s)]
*  Okay. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8107.4s)]
*  I think in order to fully show her support, she should be driving unrestricted on the streets of Tel Aviv, [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8109.4s)]
*  maybe in the vicinity of the Knesset building or wherever the Israeli defense forces are. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8120.099999999999s)]
*  This could be, I think this would really show how much Caitlyn Jenner wants to save the beautiful nation state, [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8132.099999999999s)]
*  the most moral nation state of Israel. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8142.099999999999s)]
*  Okay. I think she should be doing that. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8147.8s)]
*  This is the best way to celebrate Pride Month in Tel Aviv is what they're telling me. [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8149.8s)]
*  That's what I've heard. I've heard that this is the only way. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8155.8s)]
*  Damage of Iran's largest uranium enrichment site, Natanz, Israel says it also attacked a facility near Isfahan. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8158.8s)]
*  Giorgio Cafiero is the chief executive. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8165.8s)]
*  Perfect time for her to start driving right after a couple glasses of weenoo. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8167.8s)]
*  Okay. That's nobody take away her keys. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8175.5s)]
*  Everybody stop. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8177.5s)]
*  Nobody take away her keys. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8179.5s)]
*  It's very clear to everyone in the neighborhood and really everyone around the world that waging such strikes against Iran, [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8181.5s)]
*  killing civilians in Tehran and other parts of the country, [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8191.5s)]
*  this is conduct that will result in very serious consequences. [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8195.5s)]
*  And I think the Iranian supreme leader is very serious when he says that his country is committed to making Israel suffer [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8201.2s)]
*  as a consequence of this aggression against Iran. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8210.2s)]
*  However, we should also keep in mind that Israel, especially with all this support from the United States [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8214.2s)]
*  and other Western countries, has the ability to make Iran suffer a lot too. [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8220.2s)]
*  And I fear that we are at the beginning of what could be a drawn out country. [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8225.2s)]
*  With a tremendous amount of death and destruction that has yet to come. [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8230.900000000001s)]
*  The trouble is both sides have been threatening this kind of action for years. [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8234.900000000001s)]
*  I mean, they've had ample time to prepare their responses. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8239.900000000001s)]
*  Yes, you know, as I'm sure all your viewers are aware for many years, [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8246.900000000001s)]
*  these two countries were confronting each other in what so many called really a shadow war. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8250.900000000001s)]
*  I didn't see anything. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8257.6s)]
*  By visual confirmation, Haqqida has been hit. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8269.6s)]
*  Israel is most heavily dependent, most digital military base. [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8272.6s)]
*  I mean, we know that it's been hit. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8275.6s)]
*  I think it is positive that Russia has offered to mediate. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8287.6s)]
*  I think it's positive that President Trump had a conversation with the Emir of Qatar. [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8290.6s)]
*  The Qataris have always tried to play a backchannel role between different countries in the region, [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8295.6s)]
*  different countries around the world, including between the U.S. and Iran. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8300.6s)]
*  And I hope that some of these backchannels will be able to play a role in the future. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8305.6s)]
*  I think it's positive that Russia has offered to mediate. [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8310.6s)]
*  And I hope that some of these backchannels can create an opportunity for some dialogue and some diplomacy [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8314.300000000001s)]
*  with the aim of deescalating the hostilities. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8321.300000000001s)]
*  But to repeat, I'm not very optimistic about any deescalation right now. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8325.300000000001s)]
*  No, because one would wonder why Netanyahu would want to deescalate [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8330.300000000001s)]
*  when there was a channel for discussions and dialogue on the table already. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8335.300000000001s)]
*  I mean on Sunday there was supposed to be the sixth round of talks between the US and [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8341.3s)]
*  About the nuclear program the very nuclear program that netanyahu is professing to want to destroy [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8347.939999999999s)]
*  Well, yeah, you know the whole idea of the US and Iran engaging each other diplomatically on the nuclear file [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8353.179999999998s)]
*  also on [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8361.019999999999s)]
*  profiles the idea of tensions between the West in Iran decreasing the idea of [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8362.3s)]
*  Sanctions on Iran being lifted as a result of diplomacy [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8369.18s)]
*  all of that [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8373.3s)]
*  constituted a nightmare scenario from the [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8375.18s)]
*  Perspective and I think one of the [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8378.54s)]
*  motivations the key motivations [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8381.98s)]
*  That the Netanyahu government had for starting this war was to completely [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8384.1s)]
*  Kill any hope for diplomacy between Iran and the West [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8390.3s)]
*  Hey how some Democratic candidates have actually been calling out Israel's genocide in Gaza are now saying it's both Israel and Iran are attacking [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8394.82s)]
*  Each other super disappointing. Yeah, I saw that cat [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8399.98s)]
*  was I like had a take about it where she was like [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8403.54s)]
*  Israel attacking Iran is fucked up. And so is Iran attacking Israel and it's like [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8407.22s)]
*  I'm sorry. There's no parody here. You know what? I mean, there's literally no parody [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8412.1s)]
*  It is a fucking sovereign nation-state it is a sovereign nation-state that was attacked by [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8417.62s)]
*  America's attack dog [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8425.3s)]
*  While it is in the fucking process of doing a cleansing campaign [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8428.18s)]
*  It's ridiculous [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8433.9s)]
*  Completely unprovoked attack amidst [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8436.98s)]
*  Iran's best attempts to try and negotiate with the fucking animals [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8440.5s)]
*  That are the American government and the fucking animals that are the Israeli government [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8445.42s)]
*  It completely ridiculous there is no defense for this and [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8451.019999999999s)]
*  you will never unfortunately it is an indefensible position for Israel and yet as [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8455.859999999999s)]
*  Expected the American media is giving full-throated defense to Israel [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8461.74s)]
*  Okay [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8467.98s)]
*  It's crazy in you to try and get through our defenses [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8469.14s)]
*  But a startling moment frankly changed dynamics in the region Jake highly [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8472.58s)]
*  President Trump says that Iran needs to make a deal with the US quote before nothing is left [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8477.02s)]
*  He also told CNN's Dana Batch that Iran should have listened to him on April 12th when he gave the 60-day warning to make [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8481.5s)]

*  It's crazy because once again Iran doesn't have the same precise targeting capabilities that Israel has [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8566.3s)]
*  Because Iran doesn't have access to the airspace near Israel in the way that Israel has access to the airspace [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8572.539999999999s)]
*  above Iran [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8580.46s)]
*  So when Iran is launching missiles, they're launching it from Iran [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8582.34s)]
*  Okay, when Israel is launching attacks on Tehran it's launching attacks [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8586.460000000001s)]
*  directly with [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8594.300000000001s)]

*  When they take down an entire apartment complex like that's unique, but then you'll see sometimes [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8599.7s)]
*  Strikes that take out just the one floor, right? [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8607.18s)]
*  This is part of the reason why [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8611.9s)]
*  This is part of the reason why [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8614.06s)]
*  Iran is just like targeting wherever it can in Tel Aviv and they will call out and then use [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8615.859999999999s)]

*  100% are you fucking joking though? Like do you do you have any number of smoke for for Israel at all? [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8634.26s)]

*  Then and then in the process [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8649.86s)]
*  Expect no retaliation. Like what are we talking about? Is this anti-semit anti-semitism again? Is that what it is? [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8652.140000000001s)]

*  This death is in the hands of the Israeli state [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8691.26s)]

*  Sorry, if this is completely lived uptake, but why does Iran get to defend itself? But Israel doesn't I'm obviously with Iran on this one [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8728.98s)]
*  But it's a confusing perspective [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8734.06s)]
*  Israel has no legal right to defend itself against a population of Palestinians that it is the belligerent occupier of [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8735.9s)]
*  As opposed to the Palestinians that have a legal right and responsibility to engage in the act of a spontaneous militia [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8744.060000000001s)]

*  Okay [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8761.02s)]
*  Nation states have a right to defend themselves [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8762.300000000001s)]
*  Israel had a right to defend itself on October 7 for example [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8765.380000000001s)]
*  Inside of the inside of the boundaries inside of the green line of Israel, okay Israel had the right to do that [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8769.74s)]
*  under international law Israel had the right to defend itself on October 7 within the boundaries of [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8778.14s)]
*  Israel proper [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8785.42s)]
*  Okay, Israel had no right to attack and violate Iranian sovereignty on numerous occasions though [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8787.78s)]
*  Israel had no right to violate Iranian sovereignty when it bombed the Iranian soil technically Iranian soil [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8794.86s)]
*  When it bombed the embassy compound in Damascus, which obviously created a response [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8801.38s)]
*  From Iran that was the first time when they sent the drone swarms [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8807.94s)]
*  Israel had no right to violate Iranian sovereignty by [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8812.98s)]
*  assassinating Ismail Haniyeh the Hamas Politburo chief the civilian [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8817.619999999999s)]
*  That they killed [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8823.380000000001s)]
*  Okay that they were they were in negotiations with in Tehran [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8825.5s)]
*  Violating Iranian sovereignty, which was the second time Iran retaliated against Israel [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8829.66s)]
*  Okay, and Israel did not have a right to quote unquote defend itself by preemptively attacking Iran [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8836.26s)]
*  yesterday last night [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8845.220000000001s)]
*  Israel attacking Iran [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8848.900000000001s)]
*  Actually illegally attacking Iran gives Iran the legal opportunity to strike back in retaliation [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8851.699999999999s)]
*  What are we doing here? [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8859.06s)]
*  America's problem post 9-eleven was not that it looked to attack other countries [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8860.859999999999s)]
*  That were responsible for 9-eleven America's issue after 9-eleven was that it attacked countries that had nothing to do with [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8867.859999999999s)]
*  Do you understand yeah preemptive attack is just an attack you're right. I'm sorry. I just [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8876.599999999999s)]
*  Like attacked Iran out of fucking nowhere Iran on the other hand does have a right to defend itself [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8882.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah preemptive strike is is unprovoked [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8889.08s)]
*  That is what Israel did [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8892.039999999999s)]
*  Safety I think what's more important if I may Jake and I know this is very very intriguing [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8896.039999999999s)]
*  Of course, but I think what's more important is to understand [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8901.0s)]
*  The selection of the targets at this point and I've heard the previous set [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8904.919999999998s)]
*  Speaking about the nuclearization of Iran whether I hear I'll give you a very easy to understand example [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8911.96s)]
*  Okay, if you walk down the street and see someone that you consider looks scary [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8918.279999999999s)]
*  Okay, like a brown person and you punch them in the face. You can't tell the cops that you engaged in a a [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8925.0s)]
*  preemptive [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8934.439999999999s)]
*  first strike [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8936.119999999999s)]
*  Against them because you were fearful that they were going to strike you [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8938.279999999999s)]
*  Okay, that's not how this works. No one and if that person hits you back after you push them in the face [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8943.359999999999s)]

*  You can't literally there you can do that if they're pointing a gun at you [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8958.32s)]
*  Iran is not pointing a gun at Israel if anything Israel is pointing a gun at Iran and shooting Iran [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8961.86s)]
*  What the fuck are you talking about? [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8967.26s)]
*  You can't fantasize about things that did not happen just because the Israeli state said it could possibly happen in the future [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8968.980000000001s)]
*  In the process of fucking attacking around what is a missile in this context who shot the first missile at Iran? [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8976.5s)]
*  Not 24 hours ago. Literally it happened less than 24 hours ago [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8983.94s)]
*  Who was it in the process of a denuclearization agreement that's taking place with America and Iran [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=8988.7s)]

*  The real nuclear threat is the country with nukes that is doing an ethnic cleansing campaign [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9055.44s)]
*  And it is not Iran you fucking moron your fears that Iran may get a nuke tomorrow [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9061.4s)]

*  So that dumb fucks know what to say to piss other people off or to defend the American forum policy in the region [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9088.92s)]

*  Those nukes would have given it the sovereignty that it needs. Why do they give them up? [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9136.62s)]
*  they didn't have the launch codes Russia had the launch codes and [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9142.02s)]

*  As long as possible and eventually maybe even join in the fight [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9204.78s)]
*  I think the the objective is obviously way beyond just defanging Iran's nuclear program [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9210.960000000001s)]
*  It is aimed at destabilizing the Iranian regime in the best-case scenario [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9217.68s)]
*  It would result in the collapse of the Iranian regime and its replacement with a political order [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9222.04s)]
*  That is not hostile to Israel, but even in a worst-case scenario [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9229.12s)]
*  It would result in internal chaos maybe civil strife in Iran [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9232.960000000001s)]
*  Let's remember that Iran has all the fault lines that existed in Syria in Yemen and Libya and Lebanon [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9237.04s)]
*  in Iraq that led to [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9243.960000000001s)]
*  internal conflict and so Iran is vulnerable to that if [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9246.2s)]
*  if the central government is weakened and given the degree of [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9250.92s)]
*  mismanagement and [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9254.76s)]
*  Its minorities [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9258.6s)]
*  The irony is if Iran was like Israel they would double tap that's what Israel does [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9267.84s)]
*  They blow up a building [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9274.92s)]
*  Okay, they blow up a building and when the fucking first responders get to the building they strike it again and kill the first responders [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9276.960000000001s)]
*  Of course Iran can't do that. It doesn't have the capabilities of doing that [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9284.36s)]
*  But just understand that to understand the true depravity of Israel [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9288.240000000002s)]
*  Let's use this existing example where Israel is for once [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9292.12s)]
*  In the crosshairs of the bombing and not doing the bombing itself [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9297.04s)]
*  Well here Alonzo [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9302.640000000001s)]
*  Time for my regular scheduled unpopular opinion regarding Israel Iran is a warfare once Israel's aggression is over an Iranian armed retaliation [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9304.640000000001s)]
*  Unconnected to the original attack is equally unlawful [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9311.160000000002s)]
*  What? [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9314.76s)]
*  Notice here unconnected with an attack though if Iran attacks the Israeli Defense Ministry as a means the cripple Israel's capacity to launch further [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9315.800000000001s)]
*  Strikes that would be legal, but they have to say it. No, that is what they said [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9321.36s)]
*  No, he's he's he's right [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9325.24s)]
*  That is what they said and for the record it doesn't even fucking matter because Israel didn't actually [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9328.2s)]
*  Israel didn't actually limit its striking capabilities to like military targets anyway, and Israel doesn't have a right to fucking target [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9335.2s)]
*  Israel does not have a legal right to target [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9344.52s)]
*  Iranian soil out of fucking nowhere [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9349.12s)]
*  Okay, not that international law matters at all obviously because if it did the global [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9352.16s)]
*  Every country on the planet right now would be putting together a coalition of the willing to invade [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9358.96s)]
*  Tel Aviv okay if international law [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9365.76s)]

*  the the guiding directive [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9375.84s)]
*  We would have invaded Tel Aviv [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9378.2s)]
*  We would have invaded Tel Aviv months ago [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9380.56s)]
*  Every nation on the planet every Western liberal democracy instead of funding [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9383.36s)]
*  Israel's genocide would be invading Israel to stop it militarily, but of course international law means nothing [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9388.32s)]
*  Make sure that they actually clamp down if you want to understand why it's dangerous that international law means nothing [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9396.36s)]
*  Look no further than what Russia is doing in Ukraine where there is someone outside of the field of [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9403.320000000002s)]

*  Okay, that's what happens and it's even [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9418.2s)]
*  even even Iran a bombing Israel relentlessly would be a [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9422.0s)]
*  If they had the capability which they don't but if they had the capability [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9428.84s)]
*  that would be one of the other reasons why collapsing international law is a [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9433.08s)]
*  Dangerous predicament the only reason why the West can stand ten toes down and say fuck international law [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9438.880000000001s)]
*  Who gives a shit is because they know their enemies [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9446.08s)]

*  In the region are getting so many of Iran's military leaders Saudi Arabia literally uses the Iran [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9501.0s)]
*  nuclearization program [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9507.16s)]
*  In the same exact way that Israel does to justify getting nuclear arms themselves [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9509.04s)]
*  Saudi Arabia is not only an American asset, but Saudi Arabia itself is literally demanding to [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9514.84s)]
*  engage in nuclear proliferation [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9521.96s)]

*  You know, we're saying they don't have them already don't attack us and then they're also quietly [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9529.32s)]

*  It seems to me is like the Hassan Aboubaka is in a nutshell. I didn't just bomb the nuclear [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9570.12s)]

*  Tell us something [[02:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9844.419999999998s)]
*  It seems like it seems like this shouldn't happen we are we're attempting fate here [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9848.9s)]
*  How long will this last by your estimations Israeli officials think two weeks [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9858.9s)]
*  Yeah, as I said last night when Israel says two weeks that means it's fucking permanent [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9863.14s)]
*  Okay, that means it is going I mean they said that about Hamas after October 7 [[02:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9868.18s)]
*  Russia said that about Ukraine [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9874.5s)]
*  It was supposed to be a two-week long [[02:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9877.539999999999s)]
*  Military campaign American officials under the Trump administration said that about covid [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9879.94s)]
*  So whenever someone says oh, it's just gonna last two weeks about two weeks know that it's gonna be a lot longer [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9884.58s)]
*  Than fucking two weeks, okay [[02:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9890.58s)]
*  You know various places have various numbers here [[02:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9893.06s)]
*  But we can tell you this the top ranking military officer in Iran and the head of the revolutionary ghar core are among those killed [[02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9896.18s)]
*  Israel also says it also struck two of Iran's nuclear facilities themselves as Fahman and Natanz [[02:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9904.26s)]
*  Natanz is the site at the heart of Iran's nuclear ambitions. We saw massive flames there [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9909.06s)]
*  The head of the IAEA says Israel destroyed Iran's above ground [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9914.58s)]
*  Enrichment plan to the site. Of course a lot of the [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9918.5s)]
*  Facilities there are so deep underground that you can understand why this is going to continue [[02:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9922.82s)]
*  If annihilation of the nuclear facilities is the goal Israeli spy agency the massade [[02:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9928.58s)]
*  Releasing this video of what they say are their agents smuggling weapons into Iran well ahead of the attacks which would show obviously [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9934.34s)]
*  Meticulous planning and forethought [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9941.22s)]
*  We've got much more on that part the covert operation that went into this ahead a special report [[02:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9943.22s)]
*  But at one point the IDF posted on its social media site today all of israel is under fire as iran retaliated [[02:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9948.099999999999s)]
*  Iran claims this is just the beginning of what it says will be a crushing response [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9955.14s)]
*  I don't know if this is an F35 [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9960.179999999998s)]
*  That's fake [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9962.179999999998s)]
*  Although Marco Rubio has taken great pains to signal to Iran that the united states did not assist [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9964.179999999998s)]
*  Something iran has made clear it doesn't look real chatters on the ground in jerusalem [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9968.98s)]
*  To begin our coverage and then I say begin more in the midst of an ongoing [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9974.42s)]
*  Developing situation missiles coming in just moments ago to where you are. What is the latest you're learning? [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9980.1s)]
*  Well, we were sitting here just about a half an hour ago when the sirens were going off not only in jerusalem [[02:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9989.46s)]
*  But in the entire surrounding area and based on the red alerts we kept on getting into our phones across much of the country [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=9994.82s)]
*  We saw red alerts in in tel aviv in berseva [[02:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10000.42s)]
*  In in the north as well in some places as well as the occupied west bank [[02:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10003.86s)]
*  With the idf saying just moments ago that there were dozens of missiles that had been launched from iran toward the state of israel [[02:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10007.539999999999s)]
*  Some quote some of the missiles were intercepted [[02:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10014.18s)]
*  We saw interceptors fired off from right behind us here where we sit in jerusalem [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10017.94s)]
*  I should note that what we look out on which is generally [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10021.94s)]
*  Southward facing from where we sit is israel's kneset [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10025.78s)]
*  We saw both interceptors launched close enough that it was quite loud here behind us as well as what appeared to be [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10029.78s)]
*  Interceptions themselves and then falling falling shrapnel [[02:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10036.34s)]
*  It's unclear if any of the missiles that we were able to see got through but over the course of several minutes we heard [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10039.62s)]
*  The loud explosions of several interceptors [[02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10045.78s)]
*  We heard red alerts the siren warning going off [[02:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10049.14s)]
*  West from where we're sitting right now and that extended for a period of several minutes [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10052.58s)]
*  It wasn't all that long before the israeli military gave the heads up that people could leave shelters and that the [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10058.34s)]
*  The warning to be right next to shelters had been lifted [[02:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10064.1s)]
*  It was quite dramatic what played out in the skies not only behind us but also in the skies over tel aviv [[02:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10066.74s)]
*  We're waiting for reports from israel's magenta viva [[02:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10072.98s)]

*  The reason why the media is covering it in real time like this is also once again something that I described [[02:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10115.220000000001s)]
*  Yes, it's because we are trying to entertain the media [[02:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10122.1s)]
*  Yes, it's because we are trying to entertain a war with iran and in order to justify invading iran [[02:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10126.58s)]
*  We have to [[02:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10136.9s)]
*  Make americans feel like we got [[02:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10139.54s)]
*  Uh ample cause to go to war with iran [[02:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10142.34s)]
*  And with you of course this is ongoing as those sirens come on and missiles come in and [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10146.34s)]
*  Back and forth obviously as you say certainly a war of the air oran. Thank you very much live in jerusalem tonight [[02:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10151.539999999999s)]

*  Here we go saturday [[02:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10166.74s)]
*  We understand there's been just another wave of missiles launched from iran against israel iran promising a long night [[02:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10168.42s)]
*  And of course where you are, it is only two o'clock in the morning. So [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10173.86s)]
*  Do you expect? [[02:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10177.22s)]
*  From what you can see [[02:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10179.699999999999s)]
*  Many more missile barrages from iran through these next few hours [[02:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10182.099999999999s)]
*  Uh, well hello, erin and thank you for having me. Yes, uh, we understand when we are approaching iran and the reyna regime [[02:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10188.66s)]

*  Really? [[02:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10202.179999999998s)]
*  What the fuck? [[02:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10203.14s)]
*  Do we have another link for cnn chatters? [[02:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10204.74s)]
*  targeting not only [[02:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10208.82s)]
*  Residential areas they are targeting military installations [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10210.66s)]
*  And this is expected to escalate because they have advanced missiles [[02:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10214.18s)]
*  We have seen them provide the russians with these very missiles that they are using against ukraine now [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10218.82s)]
*  They are using these advanced ballistic missiles to target israel [[02:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10224.18s)]
*  And again, it's not perfect even when it's 80 or 90 percent of the missiles are coming over that still means there's going to be hits [[02:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10227.7s)]
*  uh, but we're [[02:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10233.94s)]
*  But but we're doing it because we have to we're not doing it because we didn't think there's going to be any retaliation [[02:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10235.86s)]
*  We're doing it because we have to because we don't see any other way to stop. There's no other way [[02:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10241.380000000001s)]
*  There's simply no other way. We have to do a little bit more, uh violence. All right, fuck it [[02:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10245.86s)]
*  I rather listen to treyings and as the missiles kept slipping past the the air defense [[02:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10249.78s)]
*  They started to use smaller systems in an attempt to shoot them down and we saw missiles slamming into the ground [[02:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10254.74s)]
*  Causing significant damage and killing at least one person [[02:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10260.58s)]
*  And so as we move forward here [[02:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10264.099999999999s)]
*  It is very clear that the conflict that is erupting now between israel and iran is different than anything [[02:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10265.939999999999s)]
*  That the region has seen [[02:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10271.46s)]
*  And it is substantially different from the conflict that has been ongoing for more than 600 days between israel and hamas [[02:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10273.38s)]
*  Inside gaza these ballistic missiles make the rockets that were being fired from gaza look like toys [[02:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10279.06s)]
*  It is causing significant damage wiping entire apartment blocks off of the map [[02:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10285.38s)]

*  All right as iranian missiles do rain down on israel, how will israel respond? [[02:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10297.38s)]
*  And will the united states be forced to get even more involved here with me now is christian whiten [[02:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10302.74s)]
*  Former senior advisor at the state department under bush 43 and trump and ambassador nathan sale former coordinator for counterterrorism under trump [[02:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10307.539999999999s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, let's start with you. I don't believe this. What would be the catalyst? [[02:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10315.38s)]
*  For the united states to get more involved. We're obviously offering support [[02:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10320.259999999998s)]
*  We have our ships in the region [[02:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10325.699999999999s)]
*  And what would that response look like? [[02:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10327.859999999999s)]
*  Well laura, I think the united states is [[02:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10332.74s)]
*  Playing a supporting role right now for israel. We're helping them [[02:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10335.699999999999s)]
*  Take down as many of these incoming munitions as possible [[02:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10339.38s)]
*  But this is a war between israel and iran with the united states playing a supporting role [[02:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10343.06s)]
*  And we want to keep it that way president trump has been very clear [[02:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10347.94s)]
*  He wants to preserve a path to a negotiated settlement. I don't see the united states deciding to intervene [[02:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10351.78s)]
*  On our own now what could change the calculus is if iran does something really stupid and decides to start taking shots [[02:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10359.300000000001s)]
*  And american diplomats or american soldiers in the region the supreme leader would have to be [[02:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10366.58s)]
*  Catastrophically dumb to make a decision like that because donald trump is not going to sit idly by [[02:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10372.259999999998s)]

*  Most people have been observing this nightmare in iran and getting closer and closer to nuclear capabilities christian is [[02:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10385.699999999999s)]
*  How much will this have attacked by israel multiple attacks? [[02:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10393.46s)]
*  How much will it have degraded iran's capabilities obviously the leadership military leadership [[02:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10398.259999999998s)]
*  But the actual nuts and bolts of its nuclear program [[02:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10404.82s)]
*  What are your thoughts tonight? [[02:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10409.14s)]
*  That's the that's the key question israel previously wiped two nuclear weapons programs off the map in the middle east [[02:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10410.74s)]
*  In iraq in 1981 and in syria in 2007 both timed by destroying single [[02:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10417.46s)]
*  Nuclear reactors around system is much more diffused from a lot of more facilities [[02:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10423.06s)]
*  That's why the united states may have to get involved. We are essentially at war with iran already [[02:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10428.1s)]
*  They killed a bunch of americans their proxies did [[02:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10433.22s)]
*  In israel, we're shooting down their missiles right now and hopefully israel has the targeting capabilities [[02:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10436.18s)]
*  The persistence to get through this and do everything they need to do to really destroy all of the centrifuges [[02:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10441.94s)]
*  Go after all of the engineers all the people involved in this to really set back this program indefinitely [[02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10447.72s)]
*  But if they can't do it alone, I think we need to realize the united states [[02:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10453.96s)]
*  I mean iran thinks they've been fighting us since 1979. It might be time we get around to recognizing that fact [[02:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10457.0s)]
*  If this turns into a war of attrition could this not backfire in israel? Yes, it absolutely would [[02:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10463.16s)]
*  At the point of a war of attrition israel loses iran is much larger [[02:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10468.279999999999s)]
*  Iran has tremendous capabilities [[02:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10472.84s)]
*  Uh israel does too, but a war of attrition [[02:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10476.22s)]
*  Uh will not happen without america entering the fight because without the united states of america [[02:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10479.98s)]
*  It's over who these spokesmen giving advice to iran to adopt something similar to the yemeni strategy [[02:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10485.42s)]
*  Limited but continuous strikes against israel to deny its people a sense of security and keep them inside shelters in perpetuity [[02:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10489.82s)]
*  Exploiting its aversion to casualties design as entity has a great capacity to withstand material losses [[02:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10495.42s)]
*  If it does not suffer human losses due to its concern for providing shelters [[02:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10500.62s)]
*  Therefore iran must adopt the tactic of limited and continuous strikes to keep them in shelters and deprive them a sense of security [[02:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10504.539999999999s)]
*  Of course yemen doesn't have these concerns iran does though [[02:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10510.22s)]
*  That's the difference yemen doesn't have these concerns because when you bomb yemen, they're like, oh, it's another fucking tuesday [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10513.9s)]
*  But when you bomb iran iran does have those concerns iran [[02:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10521.9s)]
*  Uh iranians are not. Um iranians don't have the same comforts that the israeli society has [[02:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10525.82s)]
*  But iran does have the same iran has the comforts of a normal societal existence [[02:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10532.699999999999s)]
*  They're not like the yemeni population that is only known death and destruction. That's called terror tactics. Yeah fucking no shit [[02:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10538.539999999999s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[02:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10546.14s)]
*  Terror tactics, okay. That's literally what israel has been doing [[02:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10548.859999999999s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[02:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10553.66s)]
*  Like do you think it's only terrorism when it's fucking people that you have declared as human beings [[02:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10556.06s)]
*  Is that what it is? No at that point. It's not terror tactics is fucking war [[02:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10561.74s)]
*  Where there is a glaringly obvious asymmetry between all of the most powerful nations on the fucking planet in unison attacking a country that is [[02:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10566.460000000001s)]
*  declared a foreign adversary [[02:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10574.7s)]
*  Yeah [[02:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10576.7s)]
*  Asymmetrical warfare is what you consider to be terror [[02:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10577.880000000001s)]
*  Ironically enough ironically enough the countries that are not in the periphery the countries that are outside of [[02:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10581.56s)]
*  The western scope of influence are the ones that are infinitely more restrained because they have to be [[02:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10588.939999999999s)]
*  Israel has no restraint as demonstrated by the fact that they fucking attacked iran [[02:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10595.099999999999s)]
*  Is crazy because while this is happening on us soil us marines have carried out first known detention of civilian in los angeles [[02:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10600.859999999999s)]
*  Here's the photo [[02:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10607.82s)]
*  Isn't that insane [[02:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10613.099999999999s)]
*  Like everything sucks stop both domestically and in our foreign policy everything is messed up and now there's reports coming out say stating that [[02:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10615.82s)]
*  Yeah, something big has been targeted in tehran with the strike reported the coast of the mahabad international airport [[02:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10627.02s)]
*  Yeah, I saw the I saw the burning as well [[02:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10632.7s)]
*  I've heard from multiple sources that ice is now going from park to park in los angeles arresting caregivers some who are legal residents [[02:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10636.06s)]
*  And separating them from the american children they're caring for kids are being thrown into the back of a van until their parents are located [[02:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10641.02s)]
*  what [[02:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10646.380000000001s)]
*  I haven't seen this. I don't know how [[02:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10647.66s)]
*  I don't know what the veracity of that is of that claim is first marine [[02:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10650.94s)]
*  Also tomorrow we have [[02:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10656.54s)]
*  what [[02:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10659.02s)]
*  People think turn turn the other cheek is such an effective strat. You should use it when literally getting fucking new. It's so stupid [[02:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10660.460000000001s)]
*  It's not dude [[02:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10666.380000000001s)]
*  Iran is technically turning the other cheek [[02:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10668.46s)]
*  by not even fucking [[02:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10671.82s)]
*  Striking as aggressively as israel has struck in retaliation to israel's first strike [[02:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10673.9s)]
*  So iran's retaliation is also either because they don't have the capacity to [[02:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10679.66s)]
*  Or because they're I don't know holding out for some other reason [[02:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10684.619999999999s)]
*  fairly restrained [[02:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10688.06s)]
*  Iron dome its nuclear program has been thoroughly penetrated [[02:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10690.939999999999s)]
*  And it's it's led by an 85 year old supreme leader who doesn't really have the physical [[02:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10695.119999999999s)]
*  Or cognitive acumen to be fighting this very high tech war [[02:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10701.119999999999s)]
*  So, you know this is as other guests have said that probably the most vulnerable the iranian regime has has been in many many years [[02:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10705.92s)]
*  Uh and interesting that you mentioned also the cognitive situation which I want to ask you about because you know the supreme leader is the [[02:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10714.16s)]
*  You know at a moment like this what a country [[02:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10720.4s)]
*  Where they turn to obviously the revolutionary guard chief is is assassinated and so many other leaders colonel latin retired air force [[02:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10722.64s)]
*  Colonel also with us now so colonel latin, you know israel saying that in its response iran has crossed a red line [[02:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10730.56s)]
*  Because it's some of its missiles were aimed at population centers saying that iranians will pay a heavy price for this [[02:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10738.72s)]
*  Now I understand, you know the the idf colonel [[02:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10745.52s)]
*  They're taking pains [[02:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10747.76s)]
*  Twice to say that this was about the leadership of iran and not the people of iran in fact identifying himself as an iranian jew [[02:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10749.44s)]
*  Okay, but all of that being said [[02:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10755.92s)]
*  When they're saying iranians are going to be a heavy price for this and they're pointing to civilian targets in israel [[02:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10758.56s)]
*  What does that mean for what israel is going to do to iran? [[02:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10762.960000000001s)]
*  Well, I think what it means erin is they're going to try to not only eviscerate the leadership structure [[02:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10766.08s)]
*  But there's a possibility that they might go in and try to go for economic targets [[02:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10771.52s)]
*  Uh, that could mean uh port installations along the persian gulf [[02:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10776.64s)]
*  It could mean a possible response if the iranians decide to do something drastic like close the straits of four moose [[02:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10780.56s)]
*  I I don't think that's going to happen at least at this stage of the game [[02:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10787.84s)]
*  But it could and that would then possibly risk the drawing in of of the u.s [[02:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10791.119999999999s)]
*  Into something like that because we couldn't allow [[02:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10795.6s)]
*  Uh that area to have its maritime traffic stopped [[02:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10798.16s)]
*  And uh, and that would be I think a key a key element there [[03:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10802.56s)]
*  So that would be I think one of the critical aspects to come alexander [[03:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10805.6s)]
*  I know you're you're standing outside and I know that you know as you stand there [[03:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10809.84s)]
*  You've said it feels different to you. This feels different from the last time iran launched ballistic missiles against israel [[03:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10815.44s)]
*  You know which which they did, you know in in in shock and awe, right? [[03:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10821.36s)]
*  And then we could all come in shock and not in retaliation for israel [[03:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10826.0s)]
*  uh striking [[03:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10830.4s)]
*  iranian soil [[03:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10832.56s)]
*  Did in the moment you think this feels different? [[03:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10834.56s)]
*  I I do I mean and last october did to a certain degree feel performative and [[03:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10837.84s)]
*  Now it's as I mentioned before it's a it's a lot of uncertainty [[03:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10842.32s)]
*  Israel has said that it will be attacking iran for several days. It is committed to this operation and iran has vowed retaliation [[03:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10846.08s)]
*  uh [[03:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10854.08s)]
*  Who who is someone going to blink first? [[03:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10855.28s)]
*  How does either side step down from where we are and if this escalates further, what does that mean? [[03:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10857.2s)]
*  I think there's a lot of unanswered questions and I think the next coming days are a little unclear [[03:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10862.480000000001s)]
*  Seth among those unsung answer questions is what's going to happen to the united states [[03:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10868.480000000001s)]
*  Is iran envoy to the un just spoke out and said the united states is complicit in this attack [[03:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10872.240000000002s)]
*  And that the u.s will face consequences for it. He said oh well the u.s didn't help [[03:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10877.44s)]
*  But then trump said he knew everything about it [[03:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10881.52s)]
*  Everything and he knew the day, you know sort of uh sent a very different message [[03:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10883.76s)]
*  But I am wondering seth whether you believe at this time that iran has the ability [[03:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10888.16s)]
*  And the will to conduct real attacks against american interests [[03:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10893.52s)]
*  Well, erin, I think there are two types of threats the iranians pose the one is probably less of a [[03:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10899.2s)]
*  Uh is a lower probability and that is a direct iranian attack [[03:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10904.960000000001s)]
*  Against the u.s whether it's in the homeland or an iranian attack against a u.s base [[03:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10909.279999999999s)]
*  The other which is a higher probability. I think is uh an iranian partner force the houthis in yemen [[03:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10914.16s)]
*  for example popular mobilization forces in iraq [[03:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10921.039999999999s)]
*  conducting attacks against uh the uh the u.s or u.s interests in the middle east and what's what's been interesting erin [[03:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10924.56s)]
*  Is that there are other powers that have facilitated the houthis one of the things [[03:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10932.4s)]
*  That we've seen over the last six months is both russian and chinese [[03:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10936.64s)]
*  Assistance to the houthis for intelligence satellite imagery as well as components for weapon systems including drones [[03:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10940.46s)]
*  So there are other powers and and it's it's worth remembering that the iranians were very helpful to the russians including with drones [[03:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10948.56s)]
*  And their war in ukraine. Yeah, I suspect they'll be asking for help now [[03:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10955.36s)]
*  Yeah, and those shahid drones that have been so ubiquitous by the russians [[03:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10959.279999999999s)]
*  So kareem [[03:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10963.119999999999s)]
*  You know when we look at the attack of the nuclear facilities we understand at least in the fog of this moment [[03:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10964.4s)]
*  Two crucial nuclear facilities have been struck by israel and above ground [[03:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10969.439999999999s)]
*  Above ground enrichment was taken out successfully in the tons [[03:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10974.0s)]
*  But obviously the iranians have known the israelis could do this for a long time [[03:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10978.48s)]
*  And that is why they have put so much of their crucial nuclear infrastructure deep underground as deep underground as they could to withstand this [[03:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=10982.72s)]

*  about [[03:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=11947.84s)]
*  israel and iran when [[03:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=11949.04s)]
*  Danny talks about the threat from iran. Do you recognize that language? How big a threat in your view is iran to israel today? [[03:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=11951.6s)]
*  Iran [[03:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=11961.04s)]
*  Is not an existential threat to israel, but it is a strategic threat [[03:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=11962.480000000001s)]
*  Now let's compare the records of these two countries [[03:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=11969.12s)]
*  Iran has never attacked a neighbor. Israel has repeatedly attacked its neighbors iran [[03:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=11973.12s)]
*  Signed the non-proliferation treaty [[03:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=11979.68s)]
*  Israel has refused to sign iran submits to inspection, but they by the international nuclear energy [[03:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=11982.880000000001s)]
*  Agency israel's refuses to submit [[03:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=11990.78s)]
*  Iran has no nuclear weapons [[03:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=11994.16s)]
*  Israel has between 75 and 400 nuclear weapons [[03:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=11996.400000000001s)]
*  So israel poses an existential threat to iran [[03:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=12001.2s)]
*  now [[03:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=12006.08s)]
*  Okay briefly and then I have one more point to make for the last 40 years [[03:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=12009.28s)]
*  Israel has conducted a systematic [[03:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=12014.560000000001s)]
*  campaign of this information about iran [[03:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=12018.16s)]

*  75 to 400 is a pretty rough estimate. The reason why is because [[03:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=12027.52s)]
*  israel [[03:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=12032.380000000001s)]
*  Does not even admit that it has nukes [[03:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=12033.68s)]
*  Let alone allow the the international atomic energy commission to to [[03:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=12036.88s)]
*  investigate its [[03:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=12043.1s)]
*  nukes at all [[03:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=12044.88s)]
*  The reason why that estimate is crazy is because [[03:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRNfVGYNwk&t=12047.28s)]
