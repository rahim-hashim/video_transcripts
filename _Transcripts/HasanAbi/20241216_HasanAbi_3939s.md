# School Safety Is Spiraling Out Of Control | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [December 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI)
*  like for more trouble saying depressed equals can't defend themselves. No, that is no, you're wrong. Okay, you're fucking [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=0.0s)]
*  wrong. Here's why you're wrong. The notion that guns are necessary for self defense is already a fucking notion. Okay, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=10.08s)]
*  you have eaten that propaganda hook line and sinker. This country will be infinitely, infinitely less violent, and [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=20.32s)]
*  infinitely more safe if we just wiped out all the guns. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=27.44s)]
*  The day ended well, and then everyone else was safe. So with that being said, I'll go ahead and start my remarks. Today truly [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=37.84s)]
*  is a sad day for Madison and for our country. It is a day that I believe will live in our collective minds for a very, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  long time. Here are the details today at 10 57 a.m. Our team was called to the abundant life christian school in reference to [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=54.2s)]
*  an active. We know that three people are dead, including the suspect. We know that the suspect was a teenage student who [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=63.32s)]
*  attended the school. At this time, we're not releasing the age or gender of the student or any other identifying remarks [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=73.52s)]
*  about the student. Two other people have died that died were a teacher and a teenage student. Six other people were [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=82.8s)]
*  injured. Two students are now in critical condition in the hospital, and these injuries are considered life threatening [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=91.36s)]
*  injuries. Four students are also at other area hospitals with non life threatening injuries. But these are just the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=100.8s)]
*  physical injuries that we know about. We know that this was the middle of the day of a school day, and so there will be [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=109.28s)]
*  other injuries that we'll have to face for a very, very long time. We're gonna do everything we can as a community to heal [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=116.12s)]
*  those injuries as well. Many of you have asked me about the why of this. Why did this happen? What do we know? What was [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=123.68s)]
*  the motivation? I do not know, but I will tell you this. Our detectives are working hard in the investigative process to find [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=132.44s)]
*  out as many answers as we can so that we can further prevent these things from happening not only in this community, but in [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=141.16s)]
*  other communities around our country. I think we can all agree that enough is enough, and we have to come together to do [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=149.52s)]
*  everything we can to support our students to prevent press conferences like these from happening again and again and again. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=158.12s)]
*  The school building itself is clear. We have cleared the school. There's no other threats or danger to the community. We're in [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=167.76s)]
*  the process now of what we call reunification. And what that simply means is making sure that every student that was in the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=176.4s)]
*  school is present and accounted for and returned to their loved ones. This usually takes a while, but we have practice, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=183.56s)]
*  unfortunately, and practice and practice. And that's why we're able to reunify students with their parents within hours of a [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=192.0s)]
*  school. The reunification is taking place at the Dean Clinton on Stoughton Road, and I certainly thank them for their help. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=200.56s)]
*  Again, we need our public to find an alternate route. If that is your normal way home as we get closer to the end of the day, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=208.84s)]
*  please be patient or find another route home. We're currently processing the scene. We're interviewing those who may have been [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=216.88s)]
*  witnesses, and we're obtaining search warrants to get additional information. And lastly, I want to just say thank you to [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=224.84s)]
*  everyone who's standing behind me, the organizations and agencies that they represent, the men and women of the Madison [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=233.35999999999999s)]
*  I want to remind everybody that America is the only country where the police do not advocate for more gun control. Just something to [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=241.0s)]
*  consider. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=249.12s)]
*  America is the only nation on the planet where police coalitions do not advocate for more gun control, but less gun control. They [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=250.48s)]
*  either never mention it or are directly antagonistic to gun control. Every other country in every other nation, cops are [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=260.20000000000005s)]
*  oftentimes at the forefront of advocacy for gun control. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  To do everything possible to ensure that it's not only a special place, but a safe place as well. And we're going to continue to do [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=275.24s)]
*  that. So we ask for your patience as information is coming in. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=283.88s)]
*  That's how busted that's how busted American minds are. That's how busted we are as a nation. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=288.36s)]
*  But we want to make sure that gun control is not a leftist position. Working people cannot be disarmed. Yeah, man, shut the [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=293.36s)]
*  fuck up on this particular incident. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=298.15999999999997s)]
*  You're an idiot. Okay. America is already in the throes of fascism and your mass is over here being like, oh, gun control is not a [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=300.32s)]
*  gun control is not a leftist position. Yes, it is. Okay. Yes, it is. Reasonable gun safety measures is absolutely a normal [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=308.2s)]
*  position. It's not left or right. It's just common sense. You're fantasizing about a fucking that is never going to happen. Shut the [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=316.96s)]
*  fuck up. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=323.28s)]
*  The fire department is a part of this community. Much like all the folks standing up here with me today. Our hearts are with and [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=324.12s)]
*  our arms are around everybody impacted today and everybody within our community. With that, I won't repeat the details. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=332.0s)]
*  Yeah, they think common sense is disarming the working class activity for today, much like chief Barnes. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=339.56s)]
*  Like if you're I'm sorry, dude, if you're a psychotic person, like if you're depressed, if you're a chronically depressed person, you [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=344.04s)]
*  shouldn't be able to have a gun. Okay, straight up. You could call me ableist all day every day. I'm the most ableist mother on the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=350.44s)]
*  planet. Okay. If you are a person who routinely experiences mental health episodes, you should not be able to have a gun because you [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=356.24s)]
*  will use that gun either on yourself or on others. Okay. It is incredibly likely. Sorry, it's just the truth. And I find [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=364.08s)]
*  it very strange that you can't even you can't even talk about this. Like there are still there's this this broken understanding is so [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=373.98s)]
*  embedded in the minds of every dumb Amerifat that like you even find this supposedly Marxist position on know the the working class [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=385.42s)]
*  must be armed to the gills like to the arm to the teeth. Meanwhile, the American government's response to now I believe the [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=396.18s)]
*  numbers like 14 veterans killing themselves every single day is basically telling them like here we'll give you a free lock on [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=407.58s)]
*  your gun safe and put a photo of your family in that gun safe too. So you don't kill yourself in the last moments like you look at [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=414.1s)]
*  that. And there's like one extra hurdle that you need to overcome in the moment. That's how up the situation is. I don't [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=421.94s)]
*  understand. I say this as someone who enjoys shooting guns. Okay. I say this as someone who enjoys shooting guns. The notion [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=433.74s)]
*  that like guns are anything but a fun hobby is ridiculous. The idea that like we are more safe because we have more guns is [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=442.34s)]
*  demonstrably false. And yet people still make this argument. It is so shocking. Especially in the eve of yet another mass shooting at [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=452.9s)]
*  another school is crazy. That encourages depressed people to keep it to themselves though. I wouldn't associate depressed people with [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=463.02s)]
*  mentally deranged mass shooters. What are you talking about? 50% of the gun violence that happens in this country happens [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=471.38s)]
*  because people kill themselves with guns. The fuck? What are you talking about? Yes, dude, if you have suicidal ideation, you [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=478.38s)]
*  shouldn't have a gun. It literally makes the process easier. Okay. I'm not saying suicidal people go and like do mass shootings. It's not [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=490.62s)]
*  what I'm saying at all. But they do sometimes kill themselves with their guns. And the governor and others in the federal government [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=502.9s)]
*  and how do you enforce laws on a subjective medical diagnosis? You make it you force it by law at the federal level you say if you want a [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=510.14s)]
*  gun, you need to not only get a inadequate fucking take yo for propagating a stigma that you're not at all qualified to talk about [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=517.94s)]
*  idiot. I love this dude. I love this. I love when dumbass Amerifats come in here and fucking chirp at me about how you don't [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=528.1400000000001s)]
*  understand you're actually stigmatizing mental illness by saying people who are chronically depressed should not be able to have [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=540.7s)]
*  guns. Because I believe that the primary purpose of government is to protect its citizenry. Okay, sometimes that means requiring [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=547.78s)]
*  to wear seatbelts when they're too stupid not to wear seatbelts. Sometimes it's to require is not to drink and drive when they're too [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=558.98s)]
*  stupid to drink and drive. You will not be able to outwoke me on this context by being like, Excuse me, sweetie. Excuse me, sweetie. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=566.9399999999999s)]
*  You're actually being quite ableist. You're stigmatizing people with mental health. Yeah, dude. The overwhelming majority of people who are [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=576.3000000000001s)]
*  chronically depressed or have bipolar, bipolar disorder or many, any number of different mental health complications in the community [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=582.98s)]
*  understand that reality. Okay, being depressed doesn't mean you can't decide your life is not worth living. You can value your own life [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=590.1800000000001s)]
*  while being depressed. I give you for more gun control by saying depressed equals can't defend themselves. No, that is no, you're wrong. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=595.58s)]
*  Okay, you're wrong. Here's why you're wrong. The notion that guns are necessary for self defense is already a notion. Okay, you have [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=604.5s)]
*  eaten that propaganda hook line and sinker. This country will be infinitely, infinitely less violent and infinitely more safe. If we [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=617.34s)]
*  just wiped out all the guns. Now you can say that's not going to happen. We can never do that. Everybody there's too many guns, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=625.6999999999999s)]
*  there's more guns in circulation than there are people. And that's fine. I understand that. But you cannot argue against that reality. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=632.34s)]
*  America out of all of the other comparable OECD nations is the one that has an overwhelming amount of gun violence. I wonder why I [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=640.74s)]
*  wonder what the reason is. They have the same rates of mental illness. Okay, we have the same we have comparable rates of mental health [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=648.34s)]
*  complications in this country. Why do we have significantly more gun violence? Because we have more guns, that's it. And we have no [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=655.66s)]
*  restrictions on who can have those guns. And it is unironically a direct byproduct of the interest, the for profit interest of gun [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=664.06s)]
*  manufacturers, which is why it blows my mind. There's so many quote unquote lefties will eat that propaganda hook line and sinker, not [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=676.18s)]
*  realizing that you are serving the the interests of gun manufacturers so they can turn profits. It's so stupid. America is literally the [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=686.3399999999999s)]
*  only place on the planet this exists in Australia. I cannot simply comprehend someone like my dad with bipolar and depression with [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=697.9399999999999s)]
*  diagnosed cancer saying, Hey, my son, check out this new gun I bought from Walmart. Yeah. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=702.82s)]
*  Gun for me, but not guns for the head as no guns for nobody. Or if you're gonna have a gun, it should be heavily restricted. That's it. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=711.38s)]
*  The primary purpose of a weapon is to end life. Okay, that's it. That's the primary purpose of a weapon. It's fun to shoot it. I get it. I [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=721.3000000000001s)]
*  enjoy it. But people should be able to demonstrate the responsibility of owning a weapon like that. People should have to at least [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=731.86s)]
*  identify themselves when they are purchasing a weapon. People should be able to go through rigorous background checks and mental health [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=739.9399999999999s)]
*  checks before being able to purchase a weapon with the primary purpose of ending your life or ending other people's lives. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=747.7s)]
*  Saying that everybody should be able to get a gun is basically saying like, everyone should be able to, you know, everyone should be able to [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=753.22s)]
*  get a fucking driver's license. Like we have restrictions and cars are a necessity for commerce. Cars are a necessity to be able to [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=762.38s)]
*  function in a car relying infrastructure. Guns are not a necessity in the same vein. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=771.46s)]
*  It blows my mind that people still make these arguments every time there's another mass shooting. Okay. Why is restricting murder [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=775.06s)]
*  machines such a fucking issue? It should be more regulated than cars than anything else. I know. Jesus bro's just talking and not [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=784.7399999999999s)]
*  explaining why I was wrong. Wait, what you said I'm wrong and that you're telling me to do that. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=793.0999999999999s)]
*  talking and not explaining why I was wrong. Wait, what you said I'm wrong and that you're telling me and then they claim I'm an [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=800.94s)]
*  irracial. What? I think I demonstrated why you're wrong. Okay. Guns are for self-defense. Not a hobby is a falsehood that the [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=806.1800000000001s)]
*  gun lobby and the gun manufacturers have concocted the likelihood that you will accidentally discharge or use the gun [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=817.5s)]
*  inappropriately is infinitely higher than you actually using it to intercept a situation where your life is in threat. Okay. There are a [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=827.3000000000001s)]
*  million, there are a million studies on this. So the notion that guns are for self-defense is already fucking stupid. It's [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=840.82s)]
*  completely made up. It is. But it's one that is so pervasive. It is a narrative that is so pervasive that has unironically created a [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=848.5799999999999s)]
*  need for guns because everybody has a gun. So you got to have a gun as well. It's literally, it's just so stupid. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=860.8199999999999s)]
*  In so many, in so many instances of mass shootings and whatnot. Okay. The overwhelming majority of mass shootings or [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=878.5799999999999s)]
*  overwhelming majority of shooters are actually apprehended and stopped by unarmed law abiding citizens. Okay. They swarm. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=888.38s)]
*  And that is after the killer usually ends up shooting a bunch of people. This is why you have a gun problem. This is crazy [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=896.42s)]
*  chatters. Yeah, this is a community that's supposed to be like super progressive. And yet even in a community of like super [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=902.2199999999999s)]
*  progressive like minded individuals, there's still going to be a shit ton of people who are just like, I love guns. I think [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=908.66s)]
*  you're a pussy. I love guns. And I think like everyone should be able to have them. I love guns. And I'm going to overthrow a [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=914.0999999999999s)]
*  tyrannical government in the immediate aftermath of yet another mass shooting that occurred at another school, another [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=919.6199999999999s)]
*  school shooting. It's like, it is, I think, one of the most obvious problems, one of the most obvious problems, problems in [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=927.06s)]
*  modern American society is the mass availability of weapons, mass availability of weapons and how much that is very [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=935.38s)]
*  clearly increased gun violence. Do you think these guys will be there with their guns over the the tyrannical government when [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=945.54s)]
*  Donald Trump refuses to relinquish control? No, of course not. They're going to be there. They're going to be there. They're [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=950.54s)]
*  going to be there. No, of course not. Of course not. I do not have an issue with people having guns. Okay. Although I believe [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=955.78s)]
*  that we would be living in an infinitely better society. If you know, nobody had guns. Having said that, however, having said [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=964.7s)]
*  that, however, okay, and this is something that I've covered a million times over. At the very least, we need common sense gun [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=973.14s)]
*  violence prevention methods, and that requires regulation and restriction. And the relatively modern interpretation, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=980.86s)]
*  relatively modern false interpretation of the Second Amendment that plays a massive role in Americans politicizing their [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=990.26s)]
*  commodity fetish has caused this ginormous collapse in in and is a endless hurdle against this sort of thing. Everything [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=999.38s)]
*  if we're going to talk about this from the perspective of like cultural signifiers, like things that we associate with our [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1010.98s)]
*  identity guns, just like every other commodity is not just a thing that you own for a purpose. It's not like your pan. Okay. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1016.5s)]
*  It's not like it's not a replaceable commodity. It becomes something more than that. When you own a gun, you become a gun [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1028.6200000000001s)]
*  guy. You know, you have a gun, you like guns, you know, the different kinds of bullets, you learn more about guns. There's an [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1036.94s)]
*  endless sea of information out there on YouTube and on social media where you can just like get, you know, you can get gun [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1044.3400000000001s)]
*  magazines, you become a gun sexual, it becomes a part of your life. It becomes a part of your identity. And not only is it a [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1051.5s)]
*  part of your identity, even though it's basically just like a fucking no different than like purchasing Gucci bags or some [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1057.46s)]
*  shit. Okay. And that's like your hyper fixation that you like fashion or whatever. And you like, you know, Gucci bags. So [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1064.54s)]
*  you just buy a bunch of Gucci bags. It's not as though you live on this topic. No, I'm not. And if you think if you're if [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1071.62s)]
*  you're mistaken common sense with liberalism, then that's your fault. Okay. Yeah, I'm such a lib on this topic. People [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1077.46s)]
*  love China. Okay, people talk about like how dope China is. Okay, and how socialist China is. What are the Chinese gun [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1083.7s)]
*  laws then? [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1092.38s)]
*  See my hot deck is a gun pervert. I think firearms also reflect like an ego thing. I see firearms is cool, but not [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1094.5s)]
*  different than like a really cool power tool. Not as a flex type thing because people will take selfies with their [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1107.46s)]
*  air routines. But I've never seen someone take a selfie with a Milwaukee impact driver. Yeah, no, that you're absolutely [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1112.14s)]
*  right about that. You're absolutely right about that. Anyway, people are like paternalism is bad when it comes to [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1118.82s)]
*  guns and then advocate for universal health care. Yeah, no, all every all matter of all matter of government action [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1126.98s)]
*  is paternalistic. You are supposed to write rules and restrictions and regulations for the dumbest person in society. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1132.9399999999998s)]
*  That's how you protect people both from themselves and potentially from others as well. That's what is that's in the [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1139.06s)]
*  most reductive terms. That's what governance is about. Okay, anyway here, let's continue. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1146.7s)]
*  Yes, obviously, once we have identified, we have initiated search, but we think that search is either ongoing now or that [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1152.94s)]
*  search may be concluded. Of course, it's about safety. That's the first thing. Making sure people are safe. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1162.26s)]
*  Oh, so mentally ill people are the dumbest people in society. I don't know, but you might be an incredibly dumb person [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1169.26s)]
*  if you think that that's the only people that shouldn't have guns is what I'm saying. If that's what you derived out of this [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1175.62s)]
*  commentary, then you might be both mentally ill and also one of the most intellectually disabled people I've ever [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1181.06s)]
*  encountered on this website. And there's plenty is a target rich environment. Some of your patients. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1187.5s)]
*  Are you aware of the school had any prior threats and then just jumping off of that, do you know if the shooter had had any prior [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1194.54s)]
*  contact with law enforcement? We do not know that the shooter had any prior contact with law enforcement, but I did do a [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1200.6999999999998s)]
*  check of the school. There were some calls, but they were like 911 hang ups, things of that nature. There was nothing that [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1206.9399999999998s)]
*  suggested that the school was a place that violence would occur. Chief, I know that you mentioned that the shooter died of a [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1214.3s)]
*  self inflicted gun. Did that happen before officers arrived at the school or when the shooter saw officers coming into the [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1220.7s)]
*  school? Yeah, so let me say that the cause and manner in which the shooter died will be determined by the enemy. But what I [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1226.46s)]
*  can tell you is the shooter was dead upon our arrival, police department arrival and no officers fired their weapons. Okay, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1235.06s)]
*  what are these search? Oh, look at that. Yet another. Look at that. Yet another shocking instance where [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1243.9s)]
*  I'm sorry. Yet another shocking instance where where a mass shooting ended with the shooter killing themselves or possibly being [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1250.7s)]
*  apprehended. That's usually how it goes and make sure that everyone is okay. And then if there's any evidence that we think we [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1257.18s)]
*  need to collect, we could only do that with the use of a search warrant. And so again, we have to determine if there is evidence [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1263.78s)]
*  that we will need. Everyone wants to know what led up to this. Are there any additional threats to public safety? Is this [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1272.06s)]
*  person or was this person by themselves? There are a lot of questions that we want to answer, but we have to answer the safety [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1279.14s)]
*  questions first and then we'll move on to some of the more investigatory questions. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1286.16s)]
*  I am not. No, I'm wondering about metal detectors. You mentioned in the first meeting that you were not a fan, but at this [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1293.42s)]
*  school probably doesn't have them. And do you know other schools that do? Do you think that that's something we should start [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1302.26s)]
*  talking about? I guess the question is, would you want your child to go to a school with or without metal detectors? I can't [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1308.3s)]
*  answer that. I can't right now. Yeah. Yeah. More, more metal detectors is to create the safest environment that we can without metal [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1316.1000000000001s)]
*  detectors. What did it make sense to arm the teachers? Yes, dude. Totally. The solution to the solution of the problem is [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1323.6200000000001s)]
*  fucking more guns actually arm the teachers, arm the children is what I say. I think the children must not remain unarmed. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1330.42s)]
*  They do not. They should have the opportunity to defend themselves. You know, just like Israel armed the kids, Israel has the [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1340.5s)]
*  right to defend itself. The children have a right to defend themselves. Arm everybody important to the students. Very [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1347.74s)]
*  important. It's a time for family students, probably getting ready to go out on break. And now the break will be a [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1353.18s)]
*  little less about celebrating Christmas than more about the only way friends and loved ones and staff members. The only way [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1360.3s)]
*  to solve society's violence violence problem is by keep creating more opportunities of ultraviolence. Christian school in [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1368.7s)]
*  your thoughts and in your prayers and get a couple of more. Okay. Okay. Real quick. So it's a private school that takes [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1377.3799999999999s)]
*  public money to the doctor system. So what has this revealed about the gaps in security or training for staff? Is that the [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1385.46s)]
*  thing you're thinking about about whether schools that are private that take public money? [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1393.66s)]
*  Well, what I'm telling you is, is that in 1997, I began my professional career as a public school teacher. I taught history [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1401.46s)]
*  for four years before becoming a police officer. So I did not get far enough to take courses in administration and budgeting of [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1410.18s)]
*  schools. I don't know what governs private schools. If they receive money, where that comes from. This guy used to be so this guy used [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1419.38s)]
*  to be a beneficial member of society in the school system. And what they're trying to go from being a teacher to a cop, dude, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1427.9s)]
*  that's crazy. But you could probably compare what has happened or what goes on their security measures with the security measures [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1436.94s)]
*  of any school. How much you want to bet if they paid teachers better, he would not be in this position right now. He'd still be a [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1444.66s)]
*  teacher. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1450.1000000000001s)]
*  Because you know, there has been some criticism to other law departments in their response to the school. How did that inform your [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1450.78s)]
*  game plan today? And how quickly were your officers able to get into the school? What were they told to do? Sure. We train on this, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1459.22s)]
*  as I spoke about earlier, when officers arrive on the on the scene, they immediately go in, which we did in this case, stop the [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1467.18s)]
*  threat, stop the killing, find the killer. That's how we train. And that's exactly what we did today. There's no waiting. There's no [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1476.82s)]
*  coordination of who's in charge. Everyone knows exactly what to do. I think this is a private school. It's a private Christian school, I [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1486.3s)]
*  believe. We train on this constantly. Our commander, including the fire chief and I, was in a commander's training less than two weeks ago, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1492.74s)]
*  going over this exact same scenario for another fictional location. And so all of that came into play today. And our officers perform [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1501.1000000000001s)]
*  extremely well based on their training and based on the expectations that they know exactly what to do. Stop the threat, stop the killing, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1510.6000000000001s)]
*  find the threat. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1519.8600000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1520.9s)]
*  Just one more. Hold on right here. Thank you all. I think the questions have been asked and we're we're straying a little far from [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1522.3000000000002s)]
*  what's most important at this point in time. And that is the victims and their families have three things to add. First of all, there [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1532.74s)]
*  is a lot that our community can and will do in the coming days to support the victims and their families. And we will have more [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1540.78s)]
*  information at future briefings. If anyone, and I would urge you all to include this in your stories, if anyone needs mental health [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1548.3s)]
*  support as a result of this incident and the coverage of it, I encourage them to reach out to 988 by phone or text and to get the mental [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1560.26s)]
*  health support that they need. It is incredibly important that we take care of our community in this very difficult time. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1571.18s)]
*  We all have a role in preventing gun violence. Our entire community part of the solution here. There are many things that we can do and [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1578.4199999999998s)]
*  we can have those conversations in coming days. But first and foremost, what needs to be the priority for all of us is supporting our [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1590.02s)]
*  people. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1599.22s)]
*  Yeah, I know it happens every now and then. It's just less likely. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1600.94s)]
*  This point in time, the police department, the fire department, the city, the county will share additional information about the [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1604.62s)]
*  investigation as it becomes available. But I urge you all to help our community find resources to support their mental health and to find [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1611.82s)]
*  resources to support the victims and families at this time. Thank you all. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1621.1399999999999s)]
*  Me, Stephanie and Cynthia will stick around answering the questions. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1628.1799999999998s)]
*  Let me just say, let me say just before I go, because the mayor mentioned that this was a whole of government response. It certainly was. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1632.54s)]
*  And there's so many people that we want to thank. We cannot thank everyone, but it's also a whole of law enforcement response. Even though we [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1641.14s)]
*  are in different agencies, we all have the same training. And so I want to thank our partners with the FBI who are here with me today, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1648.42s)]
*  partners with the ATF, Dane County Emergency Management. Of course, we already talked about our fire department. We've got calls from the [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1656.3s)]
*  attorney general of the United States, Wisconsin State Patrol, our governor's office, State Patrol, Monona, as well as our sheriff's [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1665.3s)]
*  office. I know I may have left someone out, but thank you for how you responded professionally, quickly, and according to the way [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1675.66s)]
*  that we all train and it all came together to ensure that no other persons were hurt. Thank you. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1685.98s)]
*  Anyway, yeah, I mean, it is, it is, we got to do a little bit of propaganda. You know what I'm saying? [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1710.1s)]
*  But we'll look at the final tally, which is so crazy to say. And I'll also tune into CNN to see if they're covering it as well, to see if we can get a better update. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1716.06s)]
*  This was a whole of government response. It certainly was. Oh, they're, they're finishing off the thing, but hold on. I live close to the school and already hearing from [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1726.58s)]
*  parents is because of anti-Christian propaganda. Do you think the right will run considering it's rare? I mean, any, any argument in the immediate [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1735.42s)]
*  aftermath of yet another school shooting that hyper focuses on the, the background of the shooter, the mentality of the shooter, mental health, or, or potentially [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1744.94s)]
*  like the ideological reasons as to why they did this, which they will do. And Republicans do it all the time, even if the fucking shooter is a Republican. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1759.42s)]
*  And in most cases, it is any argument that does not any argument that does not obviously point to the real problem here, which is massive availability of guns is a simple [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1766.58s)]
*  distraction. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1778.74s)]
*  Christian school, a private parochial Christian school with about 400 students K through 12. Police just confirmed the two victims killed were a [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1780.54s)]
*  teacher and a teenage student. Six other victims were injured, including two students who currently are believed to have life threatening injuries. Police got the call [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1789.02s)]
*  about the shooting just before 11 a.m. local time in Madison, Wisconsin. We learned moments ago that someone at the school called 911 to report the active shooter. Police say [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1798.94s)]
*  the shooter who was also dead was a juvenile, was a student at the school. Madison's police chief Sean Barnes noted earlier today, this tragic event coming [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1808.06s)]
*  just one teacher and a teen student was killed in the shooting at Madison Abundant Life Christian School. Two students are suffering life threatening injuries in critical condition made now [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1819.06s)]
*  so close to Christmas. Every child, every person in that building is a victim and will be a victim forever. These types of trauma don't just other people are injured. Two of the students are in critical condition [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1826.82s)]
*  with life threatening injuries. The other four students were taken to an area hospital and expected to survive. The nation marked the anniversary of a different at this time. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1840.82s)]
*  Three people are deceased during the media briefing earlier this afternoon. It was erroneously. They're saying during the media briefing earlier this afternoon, it was erroneously shared. Five were [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1849.14s)]
*  deceased. Again, three people are deceased. Nine in total were injured, including three deceased. And I believe two are in critical condition. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1858.66s)]
*  The year passing last year's total by just one. 2024 has now seen the most school shootings in a single year since CNN began keeping track of this horrific statistic in 2008. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1864.78s)]
*  Let's get right to CNN's Shimon Prokopis and John Miller and Whitney Wilde, who is in Madison. And Whitney, you're at the press conference. You just asked a question to chief Sean Barnes on whether the suspect was known to have had any other prior run ins with the law. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1877.66s)]
*  What did he say? He said that the suspect was not known to law enforcement. I also asked if the school had had any threats and he said they were really little surface things. 911 calls, hang ups, things like that. But there wasn't anything that had indicated that violence would happen at that school, especially that violence would happen today. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1894.26s)]
*  Jake, we did learn a little bit more. What we know is that someone from the school called reporting an active shooter, which the police chief says in his sheet, a very specific protocol. The chief described an immediate response from law enforcement, although they did not say exactly what time they made entry. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1913.7s)]
*  What we know is that that call came in at 10 57. I and other reporters here asked exactly what time did law enforcement make their way into that school. We are still waiting on that detail. Law enforcement is saying very little about the shooter other than to say it was a teenager at the school. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1928.62s)]
*  Jake, they did not say the age of the shooter. They did not say the shooter's gender, but they did say that that shooter had a handgun. And we know from CNN's Josh Campbell that that was a nine millimeter pistol, a very common type of handgun, very common type of handgun for gun violence. Further, Jake, we learned that this area was confined to one space, although the chief did not know if it was if it was confined to a hallway or a classroom. Those are still details that we're waiting on. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1945.9s)]
*  Jake, at this point, the chief does not believe that they had a school resource officer. You know, he that would have come from the city. It would have been one of his officers said, yeah, he's not aware of that. Further, Jake, and this is something that we learned earlier today, but as well, finalizing this that when law enforcement finally made entry, Jake, what they saw was that the shooter had died of a self inflicted gunshot wound. There are so many questions. The foremost, of course, Jake is why here's what the [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=1975.9s)]
*  chief said. Many of you have asked me about the why of this. Why did this happen? Wait, what? See, the liberals want you to believe we need to control our every teams. This young man just done shot up the school with a handgun brother. But I will tell you, you're right. Working hard. You're right, man. You're right. No gun control at all. Okay. No gun control whatsoever. You're right. Only in this community, but in other communities around our country, Jake, what we know is that the two other people who died, one was a teacher. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2005.9s)]
*  One was a teenage student. At this point, there are six people who are in critical condition. The chief described that with life threatening injuries for other students have non life threatening injuries. Jake, many more questions to answer here. We expect to get an update later this evening. Jake, isn't this embarrassing for America? [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2035.9s)]
*  Chief, dude, America's have no concept of shame. You can't shame people who are shameless. What do you mean? You think like broadly you can shame America or Americans? No, they don't give a fuck. When they arrived. Yes, that is the case. They believe that the shooter shot themselves. And I don't want to necessarily at this point, Jake, I don't think we're identifying the gender of the shooter. There are some questions. So we can't identify the shooter yet as male or female. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2052.22s)]
*  As we heard from the police chief there. But yes, they do believe that the shooter took took their own life. And it was in the process of their response. They responded. They got the call around 10 57 a.m. And then within 15 minutes, we heard this incredible tell from the fire chief there of how within 15 minutes, they had transported everyone from the scene to the hospital, including the shooter. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2082.22s)]
*  The shooter was still alive when emergency officials responded to the scene. And then they even removed that person and they were able to get them some treatment. But they died at the hospital. But the key here, obviously, Jake, is they're still working through trying to identify exactly the shooter. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2111.98s)]
*  And John Miller, a law enforcement source, says a nine millimeter pistol was used in the shooting. Tell us about that weapon. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2132.4199999999996s)]
*  Well, the typical nine millimeter pistol is a semi automatic handgun. Most nine millimeter pistols can have a magazine that takes up to 14 rounds, which means if you have one in the chamber, that's 15 rounds. So this is a small, compact weapon, relatively easy to conceal and one that gives you a large capacity of rounds to fire, which in a case like this, of course, just increases the damage, the danger. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2140.02s)]
*  The impact. One of the things that we have learned throughout the terrible and repetitive history of mass shootings and school shootings, but particularly that most guns come from the home. You know, when we ask questions like how did this child in every place from you, Valdez to other places, you know, obtain these weapons. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2170.02s)]
*  It comes from the home in most cases. And with a teenager, this is one of the reasons that we hear the chief saying we're obtaining search warrants. When they go to search that home, they're going to be looking for the phone, the computer, the laptop, the things where they may find the building blocks, the planning, the writings about what led to this shooting to establish motive, any notes or communications. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2195.02s)]
*  The case left behind where maybe the shooter put forth motive, but they're also going to be looking for are there guns in the home or the guns accounted for is one of those school shootings are white. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2225.02s)]
*  So I'm not a gun problem. It absolutely is a gun problem. What are you talking about? Because they're going to want to obviously find out where this weapon came from. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2237.66s)]
*  You think other countries don't have white supremacy baked into their core identity? Why the fuck don't they have mass shootings in other countries, school shootings in other countries, every single thing that you can point to in the United States of America, all of the other components that you can point to, isolate and identify exist in virtually every other country on the planet. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2245.4199999999996s)]
*  Okay, the one thing that does not exist in other countries is the ready availability of guns, the number of guns in circulation and the ease of access to weapons. That's it. I mean, not in the same way that the US has white supremacy just saying that's fucking delusional and also ridiculous. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2265.82s)]
*  Okay. What are we doing? Oh my God. Every single time, dude, this community has learned nothing from the past election cycle and the loss of the election cycle and how like staying on message is supposed to look like. That's crazy. Yeah. It's the white supremacy. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2286.46s)]
*  Let's look at, let's look at Madison, Wisconsin demographics in 2024, 7% have to have the percentage, Madison, Wisconsin is 74% white is white people killed and other white people not to say that there aren't fucking Nazis in Madison, Wisconsin, but the notion that like the notion that like white supremacy was a primary factor here is so crazy. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2308.62s)]
*  Like, what are you talking about? You don't know any of that. You don't know what the [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2331.62s)]
*  shooter's ideology is at all. We don't know anything yet. And you've already, you're, [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2335.48s)]
*  you're trying to slap on like white supremacy as a reason for those. Yeah. It's white on [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2340.1s)]
*  white violence. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2343.14s)]
*  I just like, even if this is straight up a neo-Nazi that did the shooting, it doesn't [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2344.14s)]
*  matter. Okay. It could be a straight up neo-Nazi that did the shooting and said, I'm doing [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2349.3399999999997s)]
*  a neo-Nazi. Guns are still guns and they're readily available, readily available nature [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2356.0s)]
*  of guns. Having more guns in circulation than there are people in this country is absolutely [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2362.28s)]
*  what makes it easier for these sorts of mass shootings to happen in a country where there [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2367.6s)]
*  are a shit ton of white supremacists and whatnot. It still doesn't matter though. There are [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2372.32s)]
*  plenty other countries where there's like active neo-Nazi movements. There are plenty [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2376.0s)]
*  other countries where fascists have actually gotten control of governments. Look at Italy, [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2379.88s)]
*  look at Germany. And yet they don't have the same number of mass shootings or school shootings [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2386.28s)]
*  that we have. That's it. Europeans literally look at us and go, what the fuck is going [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2391.6800000000003s)]
*  on? This is the one issue that every European social Democrat would agree on regardless [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2396.7200000000003s)]
*  of their other, you know, ideological differences with me. They literally look to this and go, [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2401.48s)]
*  what the fuck is happening in America? Whenever I cover this shit, are you a gun control [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2407.2s)]
*  supporter? No judgment. I just don't think I've ever heard your thoughts on it. Yes, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2411.4399999999996s)]
*  of course I'm a gun control supporter. What kind of crazy question is that? Yes, I believe [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2415.3199999999997s)]
*  in good governance. Of course. The only time I could think of a similar thing occurring [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2419.9199999999996s)]
*  in Europe would be back in 2011 when a neo-Nazi killed a bunch of kids at a summer camp. That's [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2424.48s)]
*  the only time I can think of that mirrors America's mass shooting epidemic. Yeah. Right-wingers [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2427.68s)]
*  in a country outside of the U S look at their gun violence in the same eyes as left-wingers. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2431.48s)]
*  And I believe that's the only time that we're seeing this happening. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2435.2799999999997s)]

*  New study shows millions of Americans may have already asked themselves these questions or versions of them, especially in the wake of horrific mass shootings like those in Buffalo and Uvalde record breaking spikes in gun sales over the last two years alongside surveys indicating that self protection continues to be the dominant reason for buying guns underscore a widely held belief that gun that a gun in the home has security benefits. New study from our research team recently published in the Annals of Internal Medicine shows no such benefits. We found the opposite. People living at homes with guns face substantially higher risk of being fatally assaulted. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2842.64s)]
*  Mass shootings are the most visible form of gun violence in America, but they account for a small faction of fatal shootings. 100% correct. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2872.64s)]
*  It's the tip of the iceberg. Most of these deaths are lesser known private tragedies that occur in homes and on the streets. We studied 18 million adults living in California and nearly 2300 of them that died by homicide over the 12 years of the study. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2878.64s)]
*  Thanks to California's historical archive of firearm transactions, we can identify who in this enormous population personally owned guns and who lived with gun owners. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2890.64s)]
*  The study's goals was to see whether homicides were more or less likely to occur in homes with handguns. Sorry, but if you spam this spam by this before apparently shooter was a rad fam that wanted to kill men. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2898.64s)]
*  This is only from Twitter, but seems credible. No, it doesn't seem credible. You just said it's only from Twitter. We don't know anything yet. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2908.64s)]
*  Well, that could be the case. It's fucking ridiculous to go. I saw something on Twitter and now I'm running with it seems credible. What the hell? [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2915.64s)]
*  What the hell? First of all, statistically speaking, if we are going to statistically speaking, if we're going to go by like, I mean, this is pure speculation. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2925.64s)]
*  But if we're going to go by like what who the common perpetrators of gun violence and school shootings are is most likely a cisgender heterosexual white dude. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2936.64s)]
*  Okay, it doesn't even fucking matter in this situation. And it doesn't matter in any situation. Like people's ideological proclivities are sure informative. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2946.64s)]
*  Okay, they're instructive. But what you fail to comprehend, what you fail to consider is that other nations have similar tendencies. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2958.64s)]
*  They just don't have the means of enacting this level of violence. And the reason why they don't have the means of enacting this level of violence is simple. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2967.64s)]
*  It's because they do not have guns. I'd be shocked if it was actually a woman that did this mass shooting because that would not be statistically the norm. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2975.64s)]
*  It would be outside of the norm. Having said that, I reiterate my position in the aftermath of the Nashville school shooting where the shooter was trans. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2983.64s)]
*  That is the most American thing. Do you understand? It's the most American thing. Inevitably, it was going to be a woman that does a school of mass shooting or a school shooting. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=2992.64s)]
*  Inevitably, it was going to be a trans person that was going to do a school shooting or a mass shooting. That's just the reality of America. Oh, CNN confirmed the shooter is a female. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3001.64s)]
*  Do you understand what I'm saying? I said this exact same thing in the aftermath of the Nashville school shooting where the shooter was a trans person. It literally does not matter. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3010.64s)]
*  Bro, we have like 70 year old Asian men doing mass shootings. Do you know how fucking statistically unlikely that shit is in general? That's just America, baby. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3019.64s)]
*  We heard there is not a or was not a school resource officer at the school. It's obviously a private school. And I think that public schools in Madison might have school resource officers, but I'm not sure. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3029.64s)]
*  Do they? And do you think more police resources should be deployed to all schools in Madison, not just public? Yeah, I don't care about the statistical relevance either, Chadder, for the record. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3041.64s)]
*  And it's up to every school district whether they decide whether to have school resource officers or not. I'm saying that it doesn't matter what the shooter is. I'm saying that before I knew what the shooter's background was. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3051.64s)]
*  What I've been hearing is just the complete and utter devastation of what this means to those students, those parents, those loved ones, family members, and everybody that goes to not only those school, but it is a private school. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3062.64s)]
*  Why should my rights be restricted when it only addresses a symptom, not the problem? It impacts more than just that neighborhood. You have people all over the county. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3072.64s)]
*  Dog, you know this argument that you're making? Why should my rights be restricted? Argument you're making can be made for any rule, any any rule, any restriction, any regulation. You understand that, right? You don't have a right to own a gun. That is ridiculous. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3079.64s)]
*  The assertion that you have some God given right to own a weapon is already a faulty premise to start at. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3093.64s)]
*  Okay, what you're quite literally like you sound like an NRA lobbyist card carrying leftist in the chat talking like the dumbest fucking sovereign citizen you ever encountered. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3099.64s)]
*  He also had a bit of a news making remarks from President-elect Trump commenting on his conversations with world leaders. The outgoing is cabinet picks and more. Stay with us. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3111.64s)]
*  Anyway, chatters sounds like an NRA show. How will you make sure gun control doesn't just concentrate gun ownership in the hands of the right? What do you mean? What are you talking about? Like beds have been in the red board trying to make leftist like guns like Gretchen. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3121.64s)]
*  Wait, what? I mean, leftists do already like guns. American left is do. American leftists are crazy. Americans are crazy. It's just like one of those issues where you know how like even right wingers in other countries are not so brain broken as to think like [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3134.64s)]
*  every person should own a gun. America is the exact opposite. Left wingers just like right wingers love their guns. Okay. It's so funny to be like, Whoa, what the fuck? Like, why are my rights being infringed on? Because this addresses a symptom and not the root cause of the problem. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3149.64s)]
*  First of all, it is the root cause of the problem. Anyone that tells you that guns are not the root cause of gun violence as a problem is wrong. Secondly, every fucking rule and restriction technically infringes on your liberties to do something stupid here. Here are people in the 80s reacting to DUI laws. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3167.64s)]
*  They're making laws where you can't drink when you want to. You have to wear a seatbelt when you're driving. Pretty soon we're gonna become this country. Come this country. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3197.64s)]
*  It's so crazy. It's just it's just nutty. I don't know. As a Wisconsinite, I still agree with them in that video. No, I know. Yeah, what about my rights to drink and drive as a women? Previous studies have proved that question with virtually all finding higher homicide rates in homes with guns. But our study had three novel features. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3208.64s)]
*  First, rather than calculating the household as a whole, as the prior research has done, we focused on household members who live with a handgun owners but weren't themselves owners. In other words, we tackled a secondhand risk of firearm ownership. Surprisingly, little is known about the secondhand [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3226.64s)]
*  risk of a gun in the home. Imagine being able to separate the risks of smoking to smokers and the risk of environmental tobacco smoke for everyone else. That unfortunately is about where gun violence research stands today, at least partly because of the data needed to conduct such studies do not exist. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3238.64s)]
*  California's archive is unique. You know what else California is unique on? Despite being a fucking massive state and having a bunch of like weird loopholes as well or weird laws like patchwork of laws that make it less fun. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3252.64s)]
*  To own a gun and more annoying to own a gun, for example. All of those problems have led to one thing. And that is California's gun violence rates are lower than the national average. Shocking California's gun violence rates are lower than the national average. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3268.64s)]
*  So is New York's gun violence rates. As a matter of fact, so was Illinois's gun violence rates despite the fact that Chicago's right there. And even then, Chicago, most of the guns in Chicago are not coming in from Illinois anyway. It's actually coming from neighboring states that you could easily go to and get guns from. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3287.64s)]
*  Gun violence statistic map guys, you're about to find out something incredibly shocking states where there are less restrictions on access to guns have significantly higher gun violence rates. Okay, the one exception to this rule is Washington DC. And even then, it's usually proximity to other states where you can get guns with ease. You know this fucking map. You've seen this fucking map. I've shown this map many times over. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3304.64s)]
*  DC is the one exception to the rule outside of that. Virtually every single state Mississippi, Louisiana, New Mexico, Alabama, Missouri, Montana, Alaska, Arkansas, South Carolina, Tennessee, Wyoming. I've skipped DC Wyoming, Arizona, Oklahoma, Georgia, Nevada, Kentucky, Indiana, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, North Carolina, North Dakota, West Virginia, South Dakota, Ohio, Texas, Michigan, Virginia. Poverty also has to do with it. Certainly. Do we know how socioeconomic status make confessions? [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3332.64s)]
*  Do we know how socioeconomic status make confound these statistics? Yes, poverty plays a major role in this. Of course it does. It plays a major role in everything. But it's kind of like this. Americans used to say, why should I get vaccinated? That's just for obese people that could die from COVID. In a country where there is a 60% obesity metric. That means most Americans are fucking obese. They need to get vaccinated. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3359.64s)]
*  You can't fantasize about a country that we are not. You have the right rules and restrictions and regulations about a country that we are. Okay, the fuck. Only poor people do gun violence in a country where most of us live page to the page. I know that's the other scary part of this dynamic as well. Also, how are you going to restrict it? You're going to just make only rich people have guns? That's crazy. I've noticed so many people trying to redistribute the blame. It's guns people guns are the common denominator. I know. And there are so many fucking. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3387.64s)]
*  There are so many studies that point to this. It is. It's one of those things that frequently loops back to the same problem that I constantly yell about. Okay, it is a lack of interest in identifying critically thinking about anything identifying what the actual problem is. Looking at the common denominator, isolating it and trying to tackle the problem head on. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3417.64s)]
*  And when you don't actually do that, you just end up believing in a whole bunch of different conspiratorial things. What you already forget the rich guy that shot a CEO. What I'm not saying rich people don't have a do. What are you talking about? I didn't even I'm not even arguing against this. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3446.64s)]
*  Like you're literally arguing for a position that I do not hold. I'm done. I'm not doing that. It's a self propagating issue though. I only own a gun because I feel like so many insane right wingers around me are going to get violent. I know. Great. Everybody has a gun.

*  Abundant life Christian school officials asked for prayers on Facebook after the fucking shooting. It's like saying Christianity caused this problem because it was a fucking private Christian school. You know what I mean? I would never make that argument. The following list of the shooter are all anime accounts. We don't even how have people found the shooter's account yet. The name has not been released. I believe CNN. I believe CNN actually. Oh my God, dude. Stop seeing an accidentally said she accidentally. What? [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3477.64s)]
*  They wrote a manifesto on Google dot but forgot to give read access to it. Wait, what? I don't think this is the person. I think. How do you know this is the person? Yeah. Yeah. Just stop. Stop speculating on who the shooter is until until the media confirms who the person is. The only confirmation that has come so far is that the Madison school shooter was a female law enforcement official says the suspect who was a teenage student at the school is also dead. No names have been released so far. And then the [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3507.64s)]
*  and here's a great example of like people running with what they think is happening because they saw it online. You literally you literally ran with faulty information and in the process of running with faulty information, you ended up sending me the account of a dude who posted some some fucking memes like 4chan ass memes. I repeat what I said. I repeat what I said. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3537.64s)]
*  I repeat what I said when the Nashville school shooting happened. It literally doesn't matter. While the overwhelming majority of shooters are white men for the most part, it still does not change the dynamic. It's America. Inevitably, people from every kind of background will probably engage in a fucking mass shooting. And the reason for that is because the United States of America is an incredibly violent culture has an incredibly violent culture. But more importantly than that, [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3560.64s)]
*  no access to fucking mental health. But more importantly than that, last but not least, perhaps the most significant has a shit ton of weapons readily available. Okay, it's happened before to female mass shooters are very rare. But it has happened in the past. The fuck is up with your community to stream? What do you mean? Yeah, what? Here's what Tom Homan, the upcoming fucking the upcoming mass deporter in chief is saying on Fox News. This is a, [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3590.64s)]
*  a parody account or like not his real account, but this is what he says on Fox News, like Tom Homan. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3620.64s)]
*  Also, as president Trump is committed, we're going to deputize every US citizen in this country to help us find 340,000 missing children, because we need the public's help on this. Every mom and dad knows what it's like. They have a gut feeling. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3626.72s)]
*  This will be great. Yeah, no, this will definitely, this will definitely be good. I can't foresee this being massively consequential and horrifying. Deputizing every fucking psycho, every armed psycho who now believes that like, there is a stolen child. Every time they see like a brown person with a kid deputizing the armed population. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3640.4s)]
*  Why don't we address the mental health, the feelings of isolation, the lack of free public spaces and economic problems. Great question chatter who keeps saying, why should my rights be restricted when it only addresses a symptom, not the problem? Okay, great question from the chatter, the NRA lobbyist in the chat that is advocating for less gun control or no gun control while simultaneous is saying, well, why don't we just advocate? Why don't we fix all the other problems? I don't disagree with you. I think we should fix all those other problems as well, which is why I advocate for those other problems every fucking [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3666.24s)]
*  day of the week, including today. The issue here is, even if you were to solve many of these issues, there would still be a shit ton of gun violence, a shit ton more gun violence in the United States of America. Okay, you want to know why? Including suicides, for example. You want to know why? Because there's a shit ton of guns. That's it. It's that simple. It's so funny when people go, Oh, dude, why don't we address the underlying material problems? Yeah, really? That's gonna stop your five year old from fucking shooting you in [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3696.24s)]
*  the dick. Bro, this country is so insane with gun violence. Dogs have killed their owners. Okay, dogs. How do you materially solve that problem? We have such an insane country with so much readily available weaponry that we've had. This is a country where a dog has killed their owner with a gun in the car. How do you solve that? What kind of what kind of mental health complications [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3726.24s)]
*  exist when your five year old picks up your gun and shoots you in the fucking head with it? They don't know what the fuck they're doing. It's ridiculous. And the irony here is that once again, other countries with comparable rates of mental health problems, other countries with comparable rates of poverty, literally do not have the same level of gun violence. It's that simple. One must ask the question why? They [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3756.24s)]
*  haven't solved those issues better than America. And yet they still have virtually no gun violence in comparison to the United States of America. Yeah, toddler accidentally shoes mom 22 dead while playing what with moms 22 with mom who was 22 years old dead while playing with [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3786.16s)]
*  unsecured gun boyfriend arrested. Now before you say no true Scotsman, you're not going to solve all of these problems with gun control or whatever. But like, mom was 22 years old. Yes, is a horribly written fucking article title. How do we know it's an accident? I say arrest the kid. What about other countries of similar gun ownership? What? There is no country on this planet. With like, I believe the exception of Yemen, that has a similar rate of gun ownership and even Yemen does not come [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3805.2s)]
*  near the American rate of gun ownership. There is no country on this planet that has a comparable rate of gun ownership. I people talk about sweat. I talked about Switzerland earlier, not even remotely close. No other country comes near that look. Yeah, Falkland Islands. And then number three is Yemen. And in every other country, whether it be Serbia, Montenegro, Canada, Uruguay, Cyprus, Finland, Switzerland, [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3835.2s)]
*  whatever, they all have gun control. No other country has nearly the the readily available firearms rating, like the firearms availability per capita rating. Okay. And no other country has anywhere near the lack of gun safety gun violence prevention measures that America demonstrates. It is fucking crazy. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3865.2s)]
*  America is two things gun and burger. Okay, that's it. America only has two speeds, gun and burger, sometimes burger gun. Don't touch either of those things, please. Only one party is fighting against gun violence. And it's the Morena party. Cartels get their guns from the US. Yeah, I know. I almost want to watch bowling for Columbine as well. Which is a good thing. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5ljDpE3ZI&t=3895.2s)]
*  Which is yet another Michael Moore documentary of a problem that is ever present and has never gone away. And also, simultaneously only gotten worse is a bowling for Columbine is a 2002 death penalty. And that's the only way to get away from this.
