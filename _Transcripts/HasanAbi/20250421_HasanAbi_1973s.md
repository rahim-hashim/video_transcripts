I have I have been engaging in carbicide. Okay, I have been engaging in fad aside. I've been I've been eating too much. I've been eating like shit for the past three weeks. Yeah, because my dad's here. Okay, that's it. I'm [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=0.0s)]
*  Pope Francis, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=30.0s)]
*  and 66 Pope of the Roman Catholic Church, a humble reformer who sought to make the Catholic Church more inclusive and clash with world leaders over the rights of immigrants, who was a profound advocate for the livelihood and the lives of all of those who are slain on [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=34.0s)]
*  unjustifiably in the genocide in Gaza, as unfortunately passed away at the age of 88. Now I am not a Catholic, not a particularly religious person at all, but he was a very woke Pope, a socialist, perhaps one of the most redeeming individuals for the nation state of Argentina, an irredeemable country. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=57.0s)]
*  With some notable exceptions, we're going to be talking about that in a little bit, but I just wanted to get started on that by saying, we like the woke Pope here. We are a fan of the woke Pope here. At least I am. And I mourn his passing. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=84.0s)]
*  One of the few instances where I've actually felt kind of bad about like a super old man dying. In any case, we'll talk about it. We'll talk about his background and all of that in a minute. But before I do that, folks, boys, girls, and boys, I want to talk about the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=99.0s)]

*  somber loss that we are all feeling [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=164.58s)]

*  my personal news about what's going on in the world of a son on Son of a pygram between the time period where I press the [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=171.18s)]
*  Stop streaming button and start the streaming button. So help me God. Let's get right into it [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=175.54000000000002s)]
*  and the broadcast yesterday and immediately dove headfirst into the pit and [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=179.58s)]
*  There's a lot I need to talk about on that front [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=185.66s)]
*  It is an amazing. It is an amazing show. It was nine out of ten [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=189.62s)]
*  I said Kyle looks sad that Papa Francisco died [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=195.06s)]
*  Yeah, Kai is sad too. Kai is actually a big fan of the Pope but Catholic Kai is Catholic [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=198.67999999999998s)]
*  Kai is ecumenical Marxist. So everybody calm down. He's ecumenical Marxist. All right. So what was I gonna say? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=204.51999999999998s)]
*  Oh, yeah personal news wise [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=211.04s)]
*  I dove into [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=213.23999999999998s)]
*  The pit I had the house on a gaming team here. They actually have a wonderful surprise for you guys [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=215.23999999999998s)]
*  I'm just gonna tease it for a second. They brought something very cool. They the cameras fixed now [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=222.16s)]
*  and the the bleeping noise that was coming from the from the PC that's fixed as well [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=228.72s)]
*  But the gaming team also gave a big surprise. Do you know what this is? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=237.39999999999998s)]
*  do you know what kind of controller this is they brought a Nintendo GameCube and [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=242.28s)]
*  The reason why they brought a Nintendo GameCube you might be wondering [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=247.12s)]
*  My you might be thinking to yourself. Why did they bring a Nintendo GameCube and that's because [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=252.16s)]
*  I've never had a Nintendo GameCube and therefore I never was able to play a [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=256.84s)]
*  very important game metal gear solid the twin snakes. Do you see this? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=261.08s)]
*  The holy the absolute holy grail of all grails [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=267.59999999999997s)]
*  Metal gear solid twin snakes. Now, this is [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=272.52s)]
*  Metal gear solid one. I've played metal gear solid one. I played it on an emulator on my PSP at the time [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=275.52s)]
*  I think I played on a PSP [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=280.84s)]
*  One of my proudest gaming achievements was being able to beat Psy [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=282.32s)]
*  Without actually ever flicking the controller over because the PSP doesn't have a second controller port as you guys know [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=286.56s)]
*  Very important gaming accomplishment. A lot of people don't even know that you can technically beat that boss without [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=294.04s)]
*  Flipping your controller over having said that I was able to do that on the PSP emulator now [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=301.56s)]
*  One of the greatest games of all time and I will hopefully [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=307.08s)]
*  Be able to work on it. Yes, I go mantis. How's your finger? It's fine. I worked out this morning [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=310.2s)]
*  I'll get to that in a second, but so that's all fine and dandy [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=315.82s)]
*  watched [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=320.52s)]
*  Numerous episodes of the pit. I believe I was on like episode 8 and [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=322.4s)]
*  Ironically enough I started off on episode 8 thinking that there was only two more episodes left [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=327.23999999999995s)]
*  But my mom my mom and I were locked in [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=330.71999999999997s)]
*  Straight-up locked in on this freaking show. Okay [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=335.71999999999997s)]
*  we could not [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=339.44s)]
*  Keep our eyes off of the pit [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=340.88s)]
*  It was 14 episodes 15 episodes didn't even realize and we just kept watching over it over and over again [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=345.47999999999996s)]
*  We're like and we we stayed up till 2 and at a certain point I turned to my mom [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=352.32s)]
*  I looked at the time I was like it's 1 to 30 and [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=356.59999999999997s)]
*  I looked at my mom and I was like I know this is a good show [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=360.28s)]
*  Because you're not asleep right now because she normally 20 minutes into any show falls asleep [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=364.82s)]
*  But on this show she did not I said I finished the pit last night was locked in till 2 a.m [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=370.38s)]
*  Amazing show touched on everything labor issues hospitals running like a business medical racism incels mass shootings [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=375.38s)]
*  They even talk about doctors experiencing fat phobia. It's an incredible show. It is an incredible show [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=380.22s)]
*  they talk about basically every aspect of of ethics in medicine and [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=386.8s)]
*  They don't even like they don't even you know serve it to you [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=391.62s)]
*  They basically abide by the principle of show don't tell where they very rarely [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=395.82s)]
*  Try to make a serious lesson out of it [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=401.94s)]
*  It's more so it's more so just in the backdrop where like if you know, you know, if you understand you understand and [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=404.6s)]
*  It is amazing. It is amazing. It is incredibly incredibly graphic if you are [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=411.1s)]
*  If you have no [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=418.3s)]
*  You know if you have no tolerance for that sort of thing, you can't watch it [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=420.34000000000003s)]
*  But if you do have a tolerance for that sort of thing [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=424.62s)]
*  I highly recommend it from all of the emergency room nurse and doctors [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=427.78000000000003s)]
*  I've talked to at least like they have said that this is [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=432.82s)]
*  Closely it closely resembles what happens in an emergency room. It's on max on HBO max and [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=437.42s)]
*  They don't overdo it the gore they definitely overdo it they definitely overdo it [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=444.90000000000003s)]

*  incredibly realistic and [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=459.3s)]
*  I loved it. I [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=461.82s)]
*  Loved it so much. It's also much like 24 [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=464.5s)]
*  Shot primarily with track shots that greatly increases the tension and also is shot in real time [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=468.34s)]
*  So every episode is actually an hour [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=475.61999999999995s)]
*  So it shows basically a 15 hour shift [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=479.21999999999997s)]
*  In a Pittsburgh hospital in the emergency room of a Pittsburgh hospital [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=484.14s)]

*  polite conversations happening amongst medical specialists [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=506.54s)]
*  In the common pitfalls like the common shortfalls that medical like even experienced doctors fall into [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=511.46000000000004s)]

*  much more powerful nation from committing a genocide against a population that they are the belligerent occupier of or the most powerful country on the planet that [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1280.28s)]
*  Is literally punishing them with unlimited bombs for the crime of trying to do something about the other country that's doing a genocide [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1288.0s)]
*  No, no, no, it's who is capable of more violence. What do you mean? [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1294.92s)]
*  Who do you think is more capable of violence the fucking who these are the American military dumbass? What are you talking about? [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1298.16s)]
*  Yes in terms of morality in terms of the the morality here the who these are [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1303.12s)]
*  absolutely [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1309.2s)]
*  Absolutely, absolutely [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1311.0s)]
*  Regardless of their domestic politics or whatever the who these are absolutely on a moral high [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1312.36s)]
*  I'm a higher moral playing field in the country doing a genocide and the country defending said genocide [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1316.92s)]
*  That's it address the point that I'm making rather than pointing at how these guys are scary brown [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1322.16s)]
*  Terrorists or whatever [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1328.44s)]
*  Yeah by attacking people that didn't attack them [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1330.64s)]
*  This does not make any sense a random fucking Palestinian baby did not attack Israel [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1334.2s)]
*  Okay, and yet Israel is doing a genocide on a random Palestinian baby [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1340.28s)]
*  You will never be able to comprehend what I'm talking about. I think do you believe Israel never brought race into this you did [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1344.92s)]
*  What okay listen to my words. Do you think Israel is doing a genocide or not? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1352.52s)]
*  Do you think Israel is doing a live stream baby murder or not every day every week? [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1357.6000000000001s)]
*  Israel is engaging in death destruction and carnage in the Gaza Strip. Yes or no [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1362.92s)]
*  Will you deny reality or will you recognize it? Yeah, and so is Hamas. Okay. No, no, no [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1368.3200000000002s)]
*  Don't don't do the so is Hamas bullshit. Okay [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1374.2s)]
*  Israel is doing multiple October 7th on a weekly basis to the entire Palestinian population as the belligerent occupier [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1377.1200000000001s)]
*  Which is completely fucking illegal. So obvious liar rat you got really fucking mad about some basic facts here [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1383.1200000000001s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1390.48s)]
*  800 to 400. Okay 800 to 400 [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1392.04s)]
*  1200 total [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1397.6s)]
*  1200 total that's the number the death toll of October 7 [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1400.04s)]
*  Israel kills 1200 people with a much higher civilian per enemy combatant rate than Hamas ever did [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1404.5800000000002s)]
*  This means that Israel is far far far greater of an evil than Hamas is right [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1412.02s)]
*  So if you believe that Israel if you recognize the truth that just say you hate the Jews [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1419.14s)]
*  But I don't you want me to lie to you [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1424.22s)]
*  So that you can feel more comfortable about your position because deep down inside you understand that you're immoral [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1426.78s)]
*  That your perspective is is incorrect [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1434.1000000000001s)]
*  So you have to you have to fantasize about a thing that I don't believe to make it feel [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1436.38s)]
*  Like that's the reason why I'm saying the things that I'm saying [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1442.9s)]
*  Because if you recognize that we are both operating on the same moral playing field [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1445.8200000000002s)]
*  Then all of a sudden it becomes problematic for you to try and engage in this kind of silly-ass defense of Israel while simultaneously [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1449.5800000000002s)]
*  Maintaining the position that Israel is still doing bad things [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1457.54s)]
*  Okay [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1461.26s)]
*  Stay eyes on the prize stay locked in so you recognize that Israel is committing a genocide if you recognize that Israel then it's understandable [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1462.78s)]
*  that [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1470.18s)]
*  Countries around the region should do something about that right to the best of their ability like during [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1471.42s)]
*  The Holocaust in Nazi Germany when the Nazis were overtaking the entirety of Eastern Europe for example [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1476.86s)]
*  there were people that were also trying to cut off the supply lines of [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1483.22s)]
*  The Nazi military do you feel like those people were in the wrong? [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1487.1s)]
*  Do you feel like those people did not have any right to cut off supply lines to Nazi Germany or do you feel like that? [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1492.06s)]
*  was an appropriate action to take I [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1498.3799999999999s)]
*  Personally think that that was an appropriate action to take and that's precisely why I think that the Houthis trying to block [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1501.54s)]
*  shipping lanes into Israel to try and incur to try and force some kind of economic [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1507.26s)]
*  Economic some kind of economic penalty to the state of Israel that is currently doing a genocide to the Palestinian population is [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1514.36s)]
*  perfectly moral and perfectly just [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1521.92s)]
*  This is the assessment you either agree with that or you don't agree with that anything beyond the conversation that [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1524.08s)]
*  Anything beyond keep scrolling down [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1531.36s)]
*  Why aren't you showing my messages because I don't give a shit about all of these other goalposts moving ass takes that you're trying to engage in [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1533.48s)]
*  Super super simple question that I asked you is 9-eleven good of course not shut the fuck up [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1540.6s)]
*  Now listen to what I have to say if you want to have an honest conversation [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1546.8s)]
*  I will have an honest conversation with you, but it doesn't seem like you want to have an honest conversation [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1550.52s)]
*  That's why you're fucking vomiting out as many takes as you possibly can about other people now [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1554.7199999999998s)]
*  Not even just about my takes or my perspective that you misunderstand, but now you're just trying to fucking blast as many [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1559.24s)]
*  Random takes as you possibly can [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1566.52s)]
*  Because you got that moment of attention so listen to what I'm saying if you recognize that Israel's committing a genocide which it is [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1568.92s)]
*  Okay, then you have to understand that countries that are trying to stop Israel from continuing this genocide [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1575.72s)]
*  Are actually on the right side of history. They're actually doing something that is moral [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1582.28s)]
*  Shop stopping shipping into Israel or into the region to incur economic penalties to Israel to force [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1586.76s)]
*  On top of Israel for the crime of doing a genocide is perfectly valid and perfectly moral [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1593.56s)]
*  This is precisely the reason why it is appropriate [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1598.6s)]
*  It is appropriate for me to say what I say about the onslaught allah movement [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1601.8s)]
*  This is not about their domestic politics. This is not about like tribal affairs. This is not about [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1606.12s)]
*  You know the mistreatment of women or whatever the fuck these are all completely irrelevant in this conversation [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1611.1599999999999s)]
*  That's it. Do you agree? [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1617.24s)]
*  with the [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1619.24s)]
*  Resistance movements that tried to cut off supply lines into the nazi [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1620.92s)]
*  Into the nazi military or not during the holocaust if you agree with that then you agree with what the houthis are doing [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1624.76s)]
*  Wrong killing people is never moral don't act like you aren't doing the same thing. Yes, you are supporting them [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1630.52s)]
*  Wait, what do you mean? Yes, I am. I am saying that i'm saying why i'm supporting [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1635.88s)]
*  The actions that the onslaught allah movement has taken in the red sea [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1640.92s)]
*  Do you think that i'm hiding this do you think that this is a serious crime? [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1645.0800000000002s)]
*  Yes, I am [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1648.84s)]
*  The idea that killing people is never moral is a a silly take to make here [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1651.7199999999998s)]
*  I agree with that as well killing people is never moral [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1656.52s)]
*  Okay, so why act like i'm the only one changing the subject? Wait, what? Okay. Well, i'm sorry [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1660.76s)]
*  I think you're a little too stupid to have a conversation with [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1665.9599999999998s)]
*  I've charitably tried to describe something to you and I think you're doing a great job of doing that [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1668.9199999999998s)]
*  I think you're doing a great job of doing that [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1673.0s)]
*  I'm not changing the subject i'm staying on subject the subject in the subject started off [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1675.56s)]
*  With the houthis I explained it to you. I explained my position on the matter [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1681.96s)]
*  And I asked you what your worldview is in this process. That's it. Okay, you dance motherfucker [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1687.08s)]

*  You know because I entertained [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1710.1200000000001s)]
*  What they had to say for a brief moment like that is that's so that's so crazy [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1712.92s)]
*  How rude that guy got am I wild you called him stupid his fair game? No [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1717.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I called him stupid after he demonstrated his stupidity [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1721.72s)]
*  He came in he came in with a bait post, right? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1724.68s)]
*  He came over the bay post. I still tried to walk him through the steps [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1728.44s)]
*  I still tried to walk him through uh, you know what my worldview was in this process and he refused [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1733.08s)]
*  He wasn't interested in it at all [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1739.24s)]
*  And instead he turned around and kept vomiting out other fucking bad faith talking points. I still tried to get him to [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1741.24s)]
*  Focus on the initial point of contention [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1749.1599999999999s)]
*  He was insulting me from the start [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1753.3999999999999s)]
*  I think I was pretty fair you punch you get to be punched back man [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1757.96s)]
*  Don't call him stupid and just close the chat and move on next time [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1761.08s)]

*  Do you think it's appropriate for someone to come in here and be like, uh, I bet you could why don't you go live with the hoothies, dude? [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1773.0s)]
*  Fucking why don't you go live with the hoothies? I bet they would hate your identity politics [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1780.2s)]
*  Think about the politics of the person that you're defending in this process [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1783.72s)]
*  I know some of you are also equally dense and you immediately engage in chatters rights, uh as takes [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1788.28s)]
*  But like just really reconsider [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1794.4399999999998s)]
*  What the policies of the person that you're defending are? No, he was stupid. I'm not disagreeing [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1797.3999999999999s)]
*  But if someone calls me stupid, i'm not going to react nicely. Yeah [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1800.84s)]
*  He did not come in [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1804.4399999999998s)]
*  initially [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1806.98s)]

*  I did not call him stupid off the jump [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1810.04s)]
*  I said he was stupid after he was behaving in a stupid manner. I didn't start off with oh, you're a dumb motherfucker. I start off [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1812.52s)]
*  Despite the fact that he was very clearly uncharitable. I started off by trying to [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1820.12s)]
*  Walk him through the steps [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1824.68s)]
*  Okay. Yes, i'm a human being and at a certain point i'm just going to call someone being stupid someone being stupid a stupid person [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHMmV2yxik&t=1826.92s)]
