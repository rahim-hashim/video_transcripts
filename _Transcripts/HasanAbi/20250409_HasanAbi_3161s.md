# Interviewing Nathan Tankus About The Disaster Trump Just Unleashed
**HasanAbi:** [April 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto)
*  He had to believe in his big, beautiful tariffs. And now Wall Street is finally living in the world [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=0.0s)]
*  that we all live in. Yeah. But aside from the instability, I mean, the reason why I say money [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  is so fake is partially because of the initial rebound that we saw with the fake tweet that [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=12.88s)]
*  then turned out to be Trump policy later down the line, regardless. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=21.76s)]
*  All right. Perfect. Ladies and gentlemen, Nathan tank is in the building. Hello. Hi. Well today's [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=30.48s)]
*  the day. Today's the crazy day. Yeah. I've been, I've been cribbing your famous tweet about being [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=36.64s)]
*  a leftist is just about being right, but too early over and over again. And I'm happy to finally have [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  you on the broadcast. Great recommendations from my friend, Noah Colwin, but more importantly, my, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  my friend, Paul Krugman as a, as a leftist and an analyst and an investigative reporter, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=57.36s)]
*  you are, it seems Paul Krugman's favorite and he is a friend of the show. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=65.76s)]
*  We love him around these parts. Nobel Nobel laureate prize winning economist, Paul Krugman. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=70.72s)]
*  Fake Nobel, but still even still. All right. Well, Nathan, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=78.0s)]
*  So let's get started. Let's, let's address the elephant in the room. What's going on? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=84.64s)]
*  The markets are recovering. They're rebounding yesterday. They were falling apart. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=89.68s)]
*  Lots of green today. Lots of red yesterday. Is this, is this fake is money fake? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=95.44000000000001s)]
*  Money's not fake, but it is fragile and it's a lot more fragile than people sometimes think it is. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=101.04s)]
*  And certainly apparently the people who have been put at the top of federal government [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=108.56s)]
*  do not understand how, how fragile it is. There's so much details that we can go through, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=115.28s)]
*  you know, from my point of view, this is the 69th day of the Trump Musk payments crisis. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  Originally the Trump Musk, the treasury payments crisis, but after some other stuff about New York [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  City, we can maybe get to later. I've just been calling it the Trump Musk payments crisis. And [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=133.04s)]
*  uh, I've done 21 pieces, all kind of long and involved in the last 69 days. And, uh, so there's [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=138.96s)]
*  a lot of detail, but the big picture I would say is the terror, the fear, the instability and the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=148.48s)]
*  emotional turmoil that people experience, you know, having gone in the first Trump administration, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=156.8s)]
*  but then really with the second Trump administration and these wild moves, disappearing [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=162.56s)]
*  people, disappearing people for pro Palestinian speech, disappearing people because they're [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=167.44s)]
*  allegedly part of a gang when they actually have, uh, just a tattoo honoring their autistic brother. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=171.76s)]
*  Like, you know, all of that sort of fear and instability that millions and millions of Americans [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=179.04s)]
*  and people around the world have been feeling about the second Trump administration, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=185.44s)]
*  Wall Street, and the stock market was mostly indifferent to, you know, the stock market was [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=190.4s)]
*  still, it's doing, kept doing well in crazy news, crazy news, you know, a constitutional crisis, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=195.84s)]
*  a foundational snatching the power of the purse from Congress. We can talk about what that means [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=203.12s)]
*  later, but like these foundational fundamental things, a thousand different crazy stories [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  in the stock market just sort of kind of sailed on. And then it was only as, um, doom says, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=213.68s)]
*  Liberation Day started approaching that conversations about tariffs and, oh wait, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=220.8s)]
*  maybe they're actually serious about this started bubbling up, but for the most part, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=226.4s)]
*  they've been able to hold strong, believe the Fed will figure it out or, you know, they'll back off. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=231.12s)]
*  There's all these business schools that are in charge that'll be, they're actually in charge [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=237.44s)]
*  and everything's going to be fine. They have been able to just sort of have a calm, lackadaisical [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=241.68s)]
*  outlook. These are the people who were so confident that Trump getting elected would be good for the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=247.44s)]
*  stock market that not only did they think it would be good for the stock market, they thought it was [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=254.24s)]
*  be so much better for the stock market that in advance of Trump getting re getting elected for [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=259.04s)]
*  the second time, uh, the stock, the stock market started just trading on the perceived odds of [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=265.2s)]
*  Trump winning. So the odds of Trump winning going up, and we know that because the stock market is [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=272.0s)]
*  up. So it's not just that they thought the stock market would do well. They thought it would do so [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=276.32s)]
*  much better than it would do under Biden because, because, you know, I don't know, business guys are [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=280.15999999999997s)]
*  the deal, like, you know, a dominant right wing mood and opinion throughout the financial elites [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=286.15999999999997s)]
*  of our society, the increasingly influential financial technology or FinTech elites of our [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=292.8s)]
*  society. And they were riding high and Trump finally did something that could make them [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=298.56s)]
*  understand who he is and what the stock market has been doing for the past five days, six days, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=306.64s)]
*  wherever you want to put on it, whatever, what the stock market has been doing is finally trading [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=313.28000000000003s)]
*  the way ordinary Americans have emotionally felt about Trump news. Oh, a good sign. Oh, maybe things [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=319.36s)]
*  a little bit better. I'm looking for any sign of hope. Oh, terrible news. I'm desolate. And that [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=325.04s)]
*  emotional turmoil is now what the stock market trades on. And there's literally an index of [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=330.08000000000004s)]
*  volatility. It's a, it's a financial product that they trade like any other or products that are [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=336.0s)]
*  linked to this index. VIX, right? The VIX, yeah, the VIX and the VIX is essentially has just become [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=342.0s)]
*  a measure of how freaked out and how uncertain Trump is making them feel. And the VIX blew out [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=350.16s)]
*  for the last five days. It's doing a little better now because of the latest news that we'll get to [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=357.28000000000003s)]
*  that. But the big picture is Wall Street is finally having the experience of Trump that everyone else [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=361.68s)]
*  is having. That's what's happened now. Wall Street is finally experiencing Trump the way we all, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=370.16s)]
*  and they don't like it one bit because it involves 16 hour for them. It involves 16 hours a day. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=375.92s)]
*  And the disappearing and reappearing of trillions of dollars of wealth in a matter of minutes, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=382.0s)]
*  including over fake tweets that get picked up on the media and run for 15 minutes like it did [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=388.56s)]
*  Monday. And it's literally created. And that's just the US stock market. I mean, 20, 30, 40 more [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=395.36s)]
*  trillions of dollars of volatility of value, monetary value, appearing and then disappearing [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=403.12s)]
*  move on any sign of what is going on between Trump's two ears. And they don't like it. And so [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=410.24s)]
*  this is Trump. Trump couldn't help but touch the stove. He just couldn't do it. He couldn't. He [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=418.72s)]
*  was doing so well at destroying so many things without getting a sufficient reaction, powering [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=426.48s)]
*  elite law firms, all of this. And he did such a good job of really doing a real success at [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=434.08000000000004s)]
*  walking through American institutions, but he couldn't leave well enough alone. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=442.16s)]
*  He had to touch the stove. He had to believe in his big, beautiful tariffs. And now Wall Street [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=446.40000000000003s)]
*  is finally living in the world that we all live in. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=453.68s)]
*  Yeah. But aside from the instability, I mean, the reason why I say money is so fake [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=456.56s)]
*  is partially because of the initial rebound that we saw with the fake tweet that then turned out [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=463.6s)]
*  to be Trump policy later down the line, regardless. And the rebound that we're seeing is a consequence [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=471.2s)]
*  of that as well. Whereas the instability still remains, as you mentioned, and not only does the [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=476.56s)]
*  instability still remain, but also a lot of these tariffs still remain. 10% universal tariffs slapped [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=484.16s)]
*  onto every single good is a broad sales tax that will drive up prices across the board. It's a [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=490.24s)]
*  regressive tax. It is going to make it more costly for the working class regardless. And on top of [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=499.92s)]
*  that, Donald Trump seemingly has implemented a de facto trade embargo on our largest trading partner. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=506.96000000000004s)]
*  So the fact that the markets are still in the green because there is a moment of respite from the [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=515.36s)]
*  insane universal application of tariffs to our allies and other trading partners [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=521.9200000000001s)]
*  is simply not enough. I think the market is reacting in a way where they are, they're saying, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=528.88s)]
*  okay, he's not that crazy, but what remains is the, is the truth that what he did is still an [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=534.88s)]
*  insane move that will drive up prices and also destroy certain sectors, regardless that still [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=540.7199999999999s)]
*  rely on Chinese goods. It's not just like Timo and Shane, you know, there's still plenty of stuff [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=548.56s)]
*  that's manufactured in China that the American economy relies on. Am I incorrect in this assessment? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=553.92s)]
*  None of that is wrong, but you're thinking in the time horizon of the potential economic impacts [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=561.8399999999999s)]
*  over months or years. That's not where we're at. Wall Street is now thinking in terms of minutes [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=569.76s)]
*  and hours. I mean, that to me is insane. Well, but it's not that, it's not that, well, it's not insane [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=575.5999999999999s)]
*  though, because for what's going to happen months from now to matter, you have to make your payments. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=581.44s)]
*  You have to meet your obligations today. And the volatility VIX blowing out so much [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=588.72s)]
*  is immediately an existential thing for certainly every non-street. And like, if VIX had gone, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=597.12s)]
*  if the volatility had gone up 10 or 20% more than it did, and there was no relief at all at any point [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=608.08s)]
*  of this day, many firms would have failed. That's what we're talking about. Like we're talking, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=614.4000000000001s)]
*  this is why I talked about today was the Lehman, my piece to this morning, that today's the Lehman [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=619.76s)]
*  brothers moment comparing it to September 15th, 2008. You know, there were positive moments that [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=625.44s)]
*  came on subsequent to that. But it was like, it was still months of calamity and everyone [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=632.96s)]
*  on Wall Street knew definitively, okay, this is not something that's going away. It's here to stay. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=642.0s)]
*  And that's what today was. And so, you know, there are complex, you know, it's not just like one [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=646.24s)]
*  person or a few people trading, they are institutions. And they're institutes, you know, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=651.76s)]
*  the big picture is a lot of our institutions for various sort of complicated, you can read my piece [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=657.44s)]
*  from today on it. Financial regulatory issues coming into this crisis, post 2008, ways that [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=662.48s)]
*  the financial regulators tried to fix things that were inept that didn't work post 2008, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=670.88s)]
*  left a set of vulnerabilities that were papered over by hedge funds. So we need someone to buy [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=678.24s)]
*  a ton of treasury securities. Well, the hedge funds are going to do that. They're going to [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=687.28s)]
*  leverage up, which basically just means they're going to have a whole bunch of liabilities against [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=691.12s)]
*  their net worth, their assets minus their liabilities. And they're going to have a, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=695.44s)]
*  and when you lever up, you can have a big, big balance sheet with not that much net worth. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=699.36s)]
*  And so you can hold hundreds of billions, maybe even a trillion treasuries, whatever it is, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=704.32s)]
*  and over cross however many hedge funds you can absorb what's out there. And so liquidity, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=709.92s)]
*  you know, a certain level of stability in our system, we, because we didn't build anything [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=717.12s)]
*  better or more specifically because regulators, central bankers, whatever, didn't build anything [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=722.24s)]
*  better. They thought it was too politically difficult to get through building what needed [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=727.6s)]
*  to be done. They just started, tried to paper over with what is hedge funds became increasing [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=732.0s)]
*  and high frequency traders and all this became increasingly essential to our financial system, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=738.64s)]
*  specifically in the last 15 years. And what that means is that when volatility goes up a whole bunch, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=743.44s)]
*  they've got these risk models that tell them, Oh, look, volatility is a bunch. You're only supposed [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=751.44s)]
*  to be taking this much risk with this much net worth, with this much assets minus liabilities. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=756.32s)]
*  So you got to get rid of a bunch of risk. You have to, and you have to pay down your debts. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=761.7600000000001s)]
*  And so they go selling assets to pay down their debts, causes a whole bunch of problems. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=767.2800000000001s)]
*  They also are trying to sell the assets that won't go down, they think will go down the least [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=772.24s)]
*  to our treasuries. So that's why, even though this is, you know, normally in a crisis, there's a [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=777.28s)]
*  flight to safety, a flight to treasuries. Why it's not happening now is because our financial system [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=782.5600000000001s)]
*  is increasingly relied on hedge funds. And we're treating treasuries as cash. Now they're not, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=788.24s)]
*  now that that was looking kind of wobbly. And so the federal reserve is going to have to step in [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=793.6s)]
*  and buy a whole bunch of treasuries. It doesn't really solve the problem because the fundamental [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=798.0s)]
*  problem is not the treasury market. The fundamental problem is Donald Trump is Donald Trump. And so [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=801.68s)]
*  Donald Trump, the whole, the market is just trading on quote unquote hype, what you might [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=808.8s)]
*  call hyper fundamentals, but the only fundamental, the only part of determining whether there's [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=814.4799999999999s)]
*  economic value going to be out there or not, Donald Trump, and it's what he's seeing minute to minute. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=819.4399999999999s)]
*  And that's inherently unstable. And Wall Street can't operate on this level of instability. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=825.6s)]
*  Wall Street, if there's too little instability, if there's too little volatility, there's no profit [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=832.0799999999999s)]
*  to be made because you can't trade. There's no volatility to trade on. You know, trading profits [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=837.92s)]
*  are up for the big banks, but they're losing on everything else besides trading. And, but on the [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=842.64s)]
*  other side, if there's too much volatility, the system can't function. It buckles. And so that's [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=850.88s)]
*  when everything's supposed to do that. And normally what would happen, you know, like what happened [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=855.6s)]
*  with 2020, like what happened 2008, central banks would step in in 2020. Some with fiscal policy [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=859.36s)]
*  would step in to stabilize things while trying to still deal with the structural problems. You know, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=865.6s)]
*  the federal reserve didn't make supply chain issues go away. What it did was stabilize the [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=870.32s)]
*  financial system so you could start thinking about these longer term economic problems. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=874.8s)]
*  And the thing is, how do you have central banks stabilize the financial system when the thing [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=878.8s)]
*  destabilizing it is not a pandemic. It's not just inherently some financial issues on Wall Street, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=883.68s)]
*  but it is the president of the United States doing insane illegal things every day and basically [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=890.88s)]
*  threatening to blow up the world. Like he put in 104% tariffs on China today. Like that's what came [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=896.9599999999999s)]
*  in at midnight. And what do you do with that? Like there's just nothing you can do. And they're [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=903.44s)]
*  trying appeasement. They're trying all these things. Now Wall Street is in the situation where [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=909.0400000000001s)]
*  Trump having the reins, Trump being in control is inconsistent with them having a viable business [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=916.72s)]
*  model. And so the question is, is the business model of Wall Street going to go or is Trump [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=924.8000000000001s)]
*  going to go or if Trump going to be mollified or like neutered in some way that can get the [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=931.44s)]
*  instability down sufficiently that things will be okay. It goes down now, but it's still very [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=938.8800000000001s)]
*  elevated. This is not going away under, Oh, Trump just saying, Oh, there's a 90 day relief or [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=944.5600000000001s)]
*  whatever. Yeah. Well, that's what I was going to say. It seems like he's still doing the old Trump [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=950.1600000000001s)]
*  initiative of like, he gets, he gets a boss call from Jamie Diamond or he sees, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=956.24s)]
*  he sees some numbers not moving in the direction that he thought it would. And he gets a little [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=961.5200000000001s)]
*  scared and at least backs away for a little bit to offer temporary relief. So if that's any indication [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=966.0s)]
*  of how he's going to operate, then there is definitely, there's definitely more, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=972.5600000000001s)]
*  I mean, he'll still make, he'll still make inferences to instability, but he'll ultimately [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=978.48s)]
*  still back down when pushed by Wall Street. But I want to talk about the larger scale project here. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=985.44s)]
*  I don't think that's true. I don't, I don't, I don't think that's true. He sees, he's not going [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=991.6800000000001s)]
*  to like, he's backing down now, but like under the scale of Wall Street and how Wall Street thinks [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=996.48s)]
*  Trump should have backed down over the weekend. And so Trump backing down only in the, only this [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1004.64s)]
*  afternoon is insane to them. And so, you know, a lot of people, including people who backed him [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1011.3599999999999s)]
*  for president quite prominently are now thinking in the back of the, like, Oh, I mean, they are [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1018.2399999999999s)]
*  losing a lot, basically lost all confidence in him. I think they had confidence in him. So [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1023.52s)]
*  mind boggling, you can't really wrap your head around it, but they've actually lost confidence [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1028.24s)]
*  in him this week. And it's precisely because he doesn't respect the rules of the game, the rule [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1032.8s)]
*  of the game of you're supposed to, as Joe Weisenfall from Bloomberg, you know, wrote very [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1038.96s)]
*  presciently about in November of last year, after Trump won, he doesn't respect the stock market [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1044.72s)]
*  vigilantes, you know, that was the phrase from Joe and the stock market vigilantes are supposed [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1050.6399999999999s)]
*  to be what disciplines him. And Trump doesn't respect that. And it seems like the amount of [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1057.2s)]
*  pressure, the amount of behind the scenes, controlling and arguing and just pressure just [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1062.48s)]
*  from the behavior of the stock market to get Trump to back down to the extent that he's back down. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1067.84s)]
*  And as you're pointing out, he has not fully backed down. Like the stock market is up today [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1073.04s)]
*  just because it's better than the situation before he backed down. And then there's some [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1077.68s)]
*  glimmer of hope that maybe he'll back down further. And that's getting priced in a little bit, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1082.64s)]
*  but things are so erratic that like, it's hard to think that really there's any sort of like, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1087.04s)]
*  you know, information being like, or conventional wisdom being priced in much at all. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1091.92s)]
*  It's just flantic trading up down, trading up down, you know, we could go in tomorrow [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1096.48s)]
*  and the stock market crash like 6% on some new news overnight from Trump, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1101.6000000000001s)]
*  or some new thinking or whatever. You know, the crisis from Wall Street's point of view [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1107.6000000000001s)]
*  is precisely that Trump has shown that he will not, you know, he will not cut out to the stock [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1114.56s)]
*  market vigilantes. And the combination of you won't cut out to the stock market vigilantes, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1122.96s)]
*  and you're going to cause so much instability that if the instability above a certain point, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1129.6s)]
*  which they very could easily hit over the next week, that a number of firms are just going to [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1134.56s)]
*  straight up fail, you know, a dozen Lehman Brothers, then, you know, that's an existential [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1139.2s)]
*  question for them. That then becomes an existential question for Trump. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1147.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Okay. So let's talk about a grand design here, because I do believe that in spite of all [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1150.8s)]
*  the chaos and instability, there is a method to the madness in terms of America moving in the [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1158.0s)]
*  direction of global trade. I think it's still a failure and it will inevitably yield an economic [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1164.56s)]
*  collapse. But I think that the things that the Trump administration has signaled that they're [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1170.8s)]
*  interested in doing in terms of decoupling the United States from our largest trading partner, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1178.1599999999999s)]
*  and potentially devaluing the dollar on the global stage, the five point plan basically that was [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1186.72s)]
*  presented by like what our foreign adversaries and foreign allies alike must do, I think is [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1193.92s)]
*  the reason as to why he's wielding these tariffs as a weapon. It has nothing to do with tariffs [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1202.32s)]
*  at all. Tariffs are just simply the point of contention. It's just the entry point into [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1207.36s)]
*  the conversation where it's more so the weapon he's wielding to break global trade, if you will, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1212.48s)]
*  in an effort to advance what he believes is the underlying change in global trade across the board [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1219.5200000000002s)]
*  where America becomes more of a manufacturing hub and develops its manufacturing output and moves [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1232.0s)]
*  away from reliance on or over reliance on China. And in the process, obviously, you need to devalue [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1238.48s)]
*  the American currency. This is the Janus Varoufakis analysis on the matter. And I think it's like, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1245.12s)]
*  I think that's what they're trying to do. I don't think they're going to be successful, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1252.08s)]
*  but I think that that is what they're trying to do. And they're trying to do that without any sort of [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1255.84s)]
*  initiative to build a base of manufacturing, to build the infrastructure necessary, and simply [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1261.36s)]
*  assuming that this can happen overnight or this can happen without any sort of serious investment [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1269.44s)]
*  from the public sector and by bullying foreign capital and super national capital class to come [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1277.04s)]
*  back to the United States and just like dump boatloads of money instead of just waiting out [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1286.0s)]
*  the storm and the volatility. What do you have to say to that? Well, I do think it's true that [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1290.48s)]
*  a ton of the most powerful, richest people in the Trump orbit, including Trump himself, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1297.28s)]
*  are rabidly anti-China. I don't think there's any method in the madness. I think it's just madness. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1302.56s)]
*  I think if I had one message to other leftists is you need to lose the remaining confidence you have [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1308.8s)]
*  in the American ruling class. And I know many people are going to hear that and go, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1320.3999999999999s)]
*  what do you mean? I don't have any confidence in the American ruling class. If you believe [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1323.9199999999998s)]
*  there's a method in the madness, then you still have touchingly naive confidence in the American [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1327.84s)]
*  ruling class. There's just madness. November 2024, if I were to ask you this, son, November 2024, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1333.84s)]
*  what you thought that the top concern, the top global problem that American financial elites [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1342.0s)]
*  predominantly believed existed in the world, including Silicon Valley tech, what the dominant [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1351.92s)]
*  problem in November 2024 was, what would you say? In November 2024, what the number one concern was? [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1360.16s)]
*  Number one problem, like the number one big picture problem in the world. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1367.68s)]
*  For from America's perspective? From just generally, they're just there, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1372.3200000000002s)]
*  John, is the leap view of what the biggest world problem there is. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1376.72s)]
*  I don't know. Immigration, I guess. But I don't agree with that in general or inflation. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1380.96s)]
*  The number one issue is from their point of view is falling birth rates. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1386.56s)]
*  My fertility falling global birth rates is the number one world problem that they thought we had. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1390.56s)]
*  And I can tell you, I know this very specifically. I went to a conference the first week, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1396.16s)]
*  like Chatham House, you can't attribute remarks to specific people conference with a lot of very [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1402.24s)]
*  elite people in this society. And overwhelmingly, number one was falling birth rates and not having [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1409.28s)]
*  enough children, i.e. white children, for replacement of population in the industrialized world, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1419.44s)]
*  or quote unquote, read Europe in United States, maybe throw Japan in there if they're generous, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1427.76s)]
*  and AI destroying the world, essentially. They do believe that stuff. You might think, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1434.24s)]
*  oh, that's just some crazy stuff they sell on TV or on Twitter. They believe that stuff. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1441.6s)]
*  That's what they thought the two biggest problems in the world were, predominantly. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1446.8799999999999s)]
*  Now, obviously, not every single one. But the conventional wisdom among them, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1451.2s)]
*  those were the top two problems in the world. And it's menace, it's fascism. So my point is, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1455.28s)]
*  the reason I bring that up is if you need a model of what the American elite thinking, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1461.2s)]
*  those aren't at the top two. And of course, China is part of that. And there's a whole [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1467.52s)]
*  narrative they can connect between the fertility in China. And there's all sorts of interconnections [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1470.3999999999999s)]
*  between... But the American ruling class has been getting more and more fascist, especially as [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1475.92s)]
*  tech has become more and more prominently involved. Tech got really fascist in the pandemic [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1482.72s)]
*  and reacted really negatively to being challenged in the workplace and also [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1488.0s)]
*  Lina Kahn and challenging mergers. I'm dead serious. And also Gary Gensler regulating crypto [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1492.8799999999999s)]
*  too much. I'm not kidding. They became convinced of Heritage Foundation and Cato Institute narratives [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1500.8s)]
*  about the evil administrative state from those things happening. And then those narratives made [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1510.72s)]
*  sense to them in a way that didn't plus making themselves fat. And then they became convinced, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1518.16s)]
*  oh yeah, the thing we need to do is to cut to the bone. The evil thing is the administrative state [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1524.48s)]
*  and we need to get rid of it. And that's Doge, that's payments impoundment, that's firing [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1530.48s)]
*  everyone. That's the through line of everything. Pandemic, because you're getting challenged by [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1535.28s)]
*  those annoying DEI employees who have too much power because they actually have skills. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1542.8s)]
*  And at the same time, the evil Biden administration is too leftist and anti-corporate. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1547.2s)]
*  This is what they think and goes after your mergers and everything. There must be this evil [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1555.84s)]
*  administrative state that we need to dismantle and get out of our way and we'll unleash growth [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1563.2s)]
*  in America. This really is how these people think. They are that out to lunch. There is no method. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1568.96s)]
*  I understand that. They're stupid and they believe their own lies in general. That much I know. I've [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1575.6000000000001s)]
*  been around rich people. I know how stupid they can get. And also Elon Musk himself, I think, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1581.92s)]
*  is a pretty great, pretty public version of that where you have the wealthiest person on the planet [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1587.04s)]
*  describing exactly the things that you're talking about and demonstrating his stupidity on a daily [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1593.4399999999998s)]
*  basis. My perspective on this is that like governments in general might be motivated by [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1597.76s)]
*  the elite and the interest of the elite. Of course they are, but ultimately governments [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1603.84s)]
*  in general still have long-term plans. Even, even the American government, which is seemingly [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1607.6799999999998s)]
*  more and more focused on the short-term profit motive and defending into the best of its ability [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1612.8s)]
*  still has long-term trade plans in general. And I think that this is a long-standing [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1618.56s)]
*  policy of not necessarily, I don't even think trade protectionism is the appropriate [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1626.72s)]
*  way to describe this because there is no manufacturing base that you are defending [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1634.72s)]
*  in this process. And there is also no interest in boosting manufacturing for the sake of labor [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1639.44s)]
*  in general, but instead it's simply to preserve manufacturing with the fear that I think [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1646.96s)]
*  China might any day in the aftermath of COVID when we saw what happened with our supply chains, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1653.2s)]
*  I think that there is a real fear in the Western world that China does not play by the rules in [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1658.64s)]
*  terms of global trade. This is something that they repeat and reiterate over and over again. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1664.8s)]
*  And what they actually mean is that China has a command economy and are subsidizing their [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1669.04s)]
*  output far too much and making it impossible to compete against and destroying domestic [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1676.48s)]
*  manufacturing in specific European countries and also in America as well. And those are the things [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1681.6s)]
*  that they do complain about. Like Ursula von der Leyen a year ago came out and complained about [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1688.88s)]
*  Chinese electric vehicles entering the European market, making it impossible for EU car manufacturers [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1694.24s)]
*  to compete with said Chinese vehicles because they were in their words cheating. They were not [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1699.76s)]
*  playing by the rules designed by the World Trade Organization. They were not playing by the rules. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1706.72s)]
*  They were not abiding by the rules because they were subsidizing too much. Right. I think that [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1711.92s)]
*  this is a real fear that the Western world has, but specifically the United States of America has [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1717.12s)]
*  because since Deng Xiaoping, it seems as though China has played by the global capitalist order [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1723.12s)]
*  and has beaten Western powers in their own game by offering the treats and the consumable goods [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1731.84s)]
*  at a low price point and in the process been able to develop itself into a competitive superpower, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1740.6399999999999s)]
*  if not one that is more powerful than America. So the goal here, I do think since the Obama era [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1746.8799999999999s)]
*  especially is moving in the direction of trying to undermine or at the very least like reduce [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1752.96s)]
*  our over reliance on Chinese manufacturing. And I think COVID accelerated those fears quite a bit [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1763.1200000000001s)]
*  when they noticed that if supply chains are broken, then America could be completely deadlocked. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1768.32s)]
*  And I think that that is what I do think that that is what Trump is trying to do. It's just not [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1778.0s)]
*  he's going about it in this belligerent manner and also simultaneously will fail because there is no [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1784.8799999999999s)]
*  there is no competitive. There's no competitive building of the manufacturing base. You don't [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1792.08s)]
*  think that that's correct. You think that all they care about is like birth rates in general. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1798.56s)]
*  It's not Trump himself, by the way, I'm saying like these are advisors. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1802.8s)]
*  Yeah. So I think what you're saying is generally like I would say it's basically an accurate [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1807.76s)]
*  description of the state of play bipartisan American ruling class. Let's call it roughly [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1814.72s)]
*  2013 to 2019. And that one of the things that Trump and then also and that one of the things [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1821.92s)]
*  that Trump getting elected did was a lot of people in the American elite became convinced [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1828.56s)]
*  that they did like the they didn't it wasn't enough to do kind of military saber rattling with China, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1835.1200000000001s)]
*  but they actually had to do the economic part. And so that and the Biden administration definitely [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1842.24s)]
*  reflects that dominant instinct and that a lot of the things that were sold as progressive economic [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1849.0400000000002s)]
*  policies were really like from their perspective about or from the perspective of a lot of elites [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1854.4s)]
*  were willing to back it was from an anti-China perspective. Okay, we'll do the we'll do [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1861.04s)]
*  projections. We'll do chips. We'll do inflation reduction acts, you know, green energy stuff. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1865.68s)]
*  I think I so I think that, you know, it's true about 2013 to 2019. And it's true about the Biden [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1871.92s)]
*  administration, predominantly. But I do not think it's true about the post January 6, Republican [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1878.3999999999999s)]
*  Party, I think, and especially the second Trump administration, the last two and a half months, [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1887.76s)]
*  essentially, what has happened is that the kind of existing long term strategizing elites [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1896.48s)]
*  have been increasingly pushed out and tons of those people have just been straight up fired [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1903.76s)]
*  the last 70 days. And the ones that haven't are kind of in the sidelines, you know, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1907.84s)]
*  ducking and covering. And that fundamentally that elite didn't prepare for this moment, [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1912.8s)]
*  that elite didn't do prepare, think about what if Trump tries to implement his agenda or must [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1917.52s)]
*  tries to implement his agenda by getting direct control of the Treasury's internal payment system, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1923.52s)]
*  and being able to directly choose pick and choose who gets what payments, you know, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1928.72s)]
*  a black the CIA's black budget runs through the Bureau of the Fiscal Service at Treasury. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1933.12s)]
*  And there's no sign at all of any sort of deep state intelligence service, whatever, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1939.52s)]
*  making a peep about letting a 25 year old former SpaceX employee Marco Alas bounce around the [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1946.72s)]
*  Bureau of Fiscal Service with full access to their systems, knowing that the data could be [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1953.6000000000001s)]
*  downloaded, and you could analyze it and figure out the location and identities of every spy [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1959.44s)]
*  America's paying around the world. They haven't made a peep about that. They haven't stepped up [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1966.24s)]
*  about that issue at all. Of course, this may be someone murmured by the scenes, but like [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1971.0400000000002s)]
*  tons of the CIA is getting baselift, like the FBI is getting, you know, they had no plan for Trump [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1975.52s)]
*  not respecting the rule of law at all. And they no one has gotten us off the on ramp of the [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1982.3200000000002s)]
*  imperial presidency. So the people who, and then at the meantime, at the same time, [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1990.64s)]
*  people who are Trump's inner circle are predominantly people who are new to the elite, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=1997.92s)]
*  the people who became billionaires or got rich or multi multi millionaires, whatever, in the last, [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2002.3200000000002s)]
*  you know, in the very recent history of American elites. And they've, as we've been talking about, [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2008.64s)]
*  brainwashed themselves at Silicon Valley, especially the last few years, with X and all [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2013.76s)]
*  being on X and feeding themselves fascist bile. So are you saying that like, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2018.72s)]
*  so the method to the madness is just like Curtis Yarvin style, new new voreish, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2026.08s)]
*  complete takeover of every, every federal apparatus and rebuilding in its own in its [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2033.2s)]
*  own vision and utilizing Donald Trump as like the the charismatic force that will allow this [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2039.1200000000001s)]
*  to happen? Is that what you're saying? Yes. And what what what these people discovered [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2045.36s)]
*  to their great surprise is they didn't actually control Donald Trump. They thought Donald Trump [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2049.8399999999997s)]
*  was bought and paid for somehow. They convinced themselves of this. And Donald Trump is Donald [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2054.72s)]
*  Trump. He is the guy who will say whatever, do whatever. You know, the recent reporting is [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2059.52s)]
*  that Musk has been like desperately trying to get Trump to back off tariffs. And he failed. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2065.8399999999997s)]
*  You know, they I mean, he was talking about him, novaro agency, let him destroy any administrative [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2071.68s)]
*  agency, but he can't actually get him not to do the tariffs. And so what these people are [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2077.92s)]
*  discovering the people who wanted to gut the administrative state and essentially replace [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2083.2799999999997s)]
*  the administrative state with Silicon Valley and Palantir and all this shit and like, you know, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2087.68s)]
*  in democracy in the United States, they discovered they didn't actually control the figurehead. And [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2093.7599999999998s)]
*  the figurehead, as you know, adult as he is, is still in some sense in charge. And they are now [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2099.52s)]
*  on the wrong side of him blowing up everything. And so that is what's happening in this moment. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2105.84s)]
*  And that's why, frankly, I am the most relaxed and the happiest I've been, and the most optimistic [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2113.2s)]
*  I've been in 69 days, because I saw them taking over and a full fashion takeover without sufficient [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2120.16s)]
*  response, like being very, very much on the table. And now Trump just because he couldn't help but [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2127.2s)]
*  touch the stove is threatening that alliance that was doing it. And now everyone, including [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2135.6s)]
*  everyone on Wall Street understands how dangerous this is to them. And now we're in a very different [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2141.3599999999997s)]
*  world where now Trump is a media director problem for many of the highest level elites in our society. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2147.2s)]
*  And all of Wall Street, a vast majority of Wall Street. And so as disastrous and crazy and what [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2155.28s)]
*  it's like looking at the stock market move, I'm so like, you know, my long term optimism about, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2163.6000000000004s)]
*  you know, the fight against fascism is the highest it's been in the past 70 days or whatever. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2172.1600000000003s)]
*  Okay, so why do you think Trump is so gung ho on the tariffs then? Like, what's your assessment of that? [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2178.88s)]
*  I think, I mean, you know, I'm not going to claim any expertise on what's going on between Trump's [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2188.0s)]
*  ears. But my sense in watching him and reading the full transcript of the National or the [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2194.8s)]
*  Liberation Day speech is that he's increasingly losing it. He doesn't really understand what the [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2202.0s)]
*  people who are telling him that he needs to back off are saying. And, you know, this is a guy who [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2210.48s)]
*  ran for president because he was made fun of by Obama, you know, you know, at a correspondence [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2216.0s)]
*  dinner, like he is an egotistical, venal person. And he finally feels like he can get to do what [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2222.8s)]
*  he wants to do. And he was frustrated about not being allowed to do it, quote unquote, allowed to [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2229.12s)]
*  do it in the first term. And now he's like, No, I'm going to do it this time. And I think he, [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2233.92s)]
*  I think I think he, you know, the thing is, like, he, you know, January 6, like, you know, left us, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2241.12s)]
*  we don't focus on that much. But like, you know, in a very real sense, he did, you know, even was [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2246.48s)]
*  quixotic or embarrassing or terrible, did attempt to coup. And he got away with it. And he got [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2251.2799999999997s)]
*  elected president again. Like if you're, if you're Trump and the kind of ego that Trump is, [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2256.16s)]
*  of course he believes he's invincible. And then he's Teflon Don. He is Teflon Don. He has proven [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2261.6s)]
*  that he's Teflon Don last year and he, you know, made through it. No, but, but that's not even, [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2267.92s)]
*  that's not even like, I don't even think it's, it's wrong for him to think that because all of [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2273.2s)]
*  the institutions have buckled in his presence. So it's not like, of course he's going to feel that [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2278.64s)]
*  way. I do see that. I'm just, I'm just saying that like, I think that there are advisors [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2283.84s)]
*  that he has around him. And I do think that he is following through on project 2025 fairly closely [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2290.2400000000002s)]
*  piece by piece. So that to me still means that there are perhaps different camps [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2300.1600000000003s)]
*  within the Trump, within the Trump White House. Like on the one hand, you have the Libertarian [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2306.96s)]
*  alleged pedophile psychopathic elite, the Curtis Yarvin branch. But then you also still have like [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2313.92s)]
*  the, the institutional conservatives, or at least like those who are close to institutional [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2321.76s)]
*  conservatives, like the, the heritage foundation people that he still listens to. And I do think [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2325.44s)]
*  that Trump's tariff goals still very much align with America's foreign trade agenda overall, [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2331.44s)]
*  even though it'll still obviously be a spectacular failure, both due to the way that Trump is [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2340.48s)]
*  unveiling this and also due to the other institutional hurdles that already existed and [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2345.84s)]
*  will never be, will never be fixed. Like the closest we've ever arrived in my opinion to, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2352.1600000000003s)]
*  to implementing something that decouples American trade from China was the Chips Act. And that was [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2358.0s)]
*  still stunted within the, the vision of the Democratic Party that is still a pro-capitalist [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2363.36s)]
*  one, still a neoliberal one, a private-public partnership overall. And Donald Trump himself [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2370.48s)]
*  has also said that the Chips Act sucked earlier today. He literally said that the, the closest [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2376.7200000000003s)]
*  that the American government in recent history has arrived at like implementing the vision that [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2382.88s)]
*  Donald Trump seemingly is on board with was actually shitty, was actually bad, was, was awful. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2387.52s)]
*  So to me, it feels like, it feels like there is- [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2394.64s)]
*  I think that all of that's right. I think all of that's right. I think, I think the big picture [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2398.8s)]
*  of like the different camps is right. And I think it fits with what I've seen on the Trump must [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2404.0s)]
*  payments crisis and using the payments, weaponizing the payment system against, [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2409.12s)]
*  to take over the government and weaponizing it against any political enemy. I think, and the [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2414.3199999999997s)]
*  long broad stroke vision, I think there is, yeah, there is like something that's consistent with [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2420.48s)]
*  a longer-term vision about the China stuff, but like none of the specifics of the tariff stuff [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2425.6s)]
*  now are any related to it. Like the tariff numbers were literally generated on chat GPT. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2430.0s)]
*  And that was according to the Washington Post reporting, that was Trump picked that over the [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2435.2s)]
*  more sophisticated versions three hours before going to the Rose Garden. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2440.24s)]
*  It wasn't about tariffs at all. There was no, the tariffs, the tariffs very clearly, if you, [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2444.24s)]
*  if you follow what they've been saying, is not real. Even the foreign trade barriers that his [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2450.56s)]
*  advisors set up that like, I think it was like what, 400 page document that he held up, those [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2458.16s)]
*  foreign trade barriers that mean anything from like foreign nations and their own domestic [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2465.84s)]
*  regulatory body saying that they don't want salmonella chicken, for example, all the way to, [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2472.08s)]
*  I guess like what they consider to be currency manipulation. Those weren't even, that was just [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2476.8s)]
*  simply a marketing tool. And the reality of the matter was that this calculation, as they revealed [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2482.32s)]
*  later, was simply around trade deficits. I think that vision is also flawed and stupid. I don't [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2487.84s)]
*  agree with their assessment, especially considering that they're the ones who designed [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2495.2s)]
*  global trade to be this way. And America's power is enforced through the dollar being the reserve [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2500.72s)]
*  currency and 80% of all transactions happening in the international scale happening with the dollar, [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2507.2799999999997s)]
*  which means that we have complete control over all trade that happens even amongst other foreign [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2513.52s)]
*  nations amongst themselves. But seemingly, seemingly that there is a, there is a, there's [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2518.08s)]
*  an interest to, to like, it does feel like there's an interest even by the Trump administration to, [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2528.0s)]
*  to move, albeit in a belligerent manner to, to, to have some kind of manufacturing capabilities [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2535.68s)]
*  in the States. I don't think they'll be able to pull it off. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2542.7999999999997s)]
*  I think that's the ideological vision. I think that's like been the, I mean, that's been Trump's [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2546.96s)]
*  motivation until when he first conceived of this stuff in the 1980s. But, you know, I think, [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2552.4s)]
*  I think as this process has gone on, you know, the train has gone away. And I think, you know, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2559.6s)]
*  for Trump, it's about just a pure, you know, exercise, vengeance and power. And [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2567.28s)]
*  the space, like any specifics were like vague idea, let's do tariffs to develop the domestic [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2574.88s)]
*  manufacturing. Sure. But basically the specifics have been completely overridden from that. And [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2580.16s)]
*  the specifics are, are just purely all this sort of venal power thing. And there are people, [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2587.92s)]
*  including people very close to Trump who are trying to get him to do things differently. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2595.84s)]
*  And he's not listening to them. You know, maybe there's like a couple advisors who were telling [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2600.7200000000003s)]
*  him exactly who wants to sit, wants to hear, but they, they haven't thought through any of this. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2606.0s)]
*  They don't understand how, like, for example, like, you know, I watched half, you know, cause [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2612.0s)]
*  I try to watch Fox news. Cause that's what you need to watch. If you want to watch a lot, [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2615.76s)]
*  I almost exclusively watch Fox news. So I watched Laura Ingram last night at 7 PM and [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2619.36s)]
*  the whole, her whole segment was about saving capitalism and all this stuff. And they're like [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2628.56s)]
*  talking about trade deficits, like they just discovered them and they're like, Ooh, [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2633.8399999999997s)]
*  trade deficits, you'll accumulate, you know, they'll accumulate dollars and they'll be able to, [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2638.4s)]
*  you know, buy up, you know, buy up America and pointing out stuff. It's like, this was a solved [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2642.7999999999997s)]
*  problem from American elites, 50 years of investment. There's a foreign investment committee. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2649.44s)]
*  The 50th anniversary is next month. That literally went like, Oh, Saudi Arabia, [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2654.3199999999997s)]
*  you want to buy out a totally a buyout American companies? Nope. You can't do that. You can buy [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2661.12s)]
*  little slices of them, but you can't have any control or any power over American corporations [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2666.08s)]
*  just because you have dollars, you know, property ownership. You can buy out a company and control [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2670.4799999999996s)]
*  it. That's, that's for, that's for us to decide whether you can do it. Like these kinds of things [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2674.24s)]
*  have been solved problems. And there are other elements of that that have made them solve [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2678.8799999999997s)]
*  problems. Not least of which is you get too out of line will freeze your treasury securities. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2683.6s)]
*  Like we did after the invasion of Ukraine with Russia. You know, there's all sorts of aspects, [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2689.2799999999997s)]
*  you know, I'm going to be writing about them in the next month where yeah, it's incredibly [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2695.68s)]
*  favors dollar hegemony and they don't like, you know, I, the sense I have is they don't know very [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2702.0s)]
*  much at all about how these, cause this shit is nerd shit. It's new shit. Oh, I'm going to learn [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2711.12s)]
*  how something called syphus works and it's all history. I'm going to do that. I'm going to learn [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2716.96s)]
*  about like, uh, you know, you know, the federal reserve and the treasury and all their bureaus. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2721.6s)]
*  They don't, it's not shit. And yeah, they like there, there's a lot fewer of those nerds bouncing [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2728.16s)]
*  around Trump world than some people might imagine. I do. And so they don't be literally [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2733.92s)]
*  don't understand how, how it vanished the U S is and how many different apparatuses, [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2741.2799999999997s)]
*  including national security apparatuses that we have or that the United States has to use the [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2748.88s)]
*  dollar in its favor. And so they literally do think we're so, so disadvantaged and in the process, [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2753.92s)]
*  they're blowing up all of America's, all of the United States' advantages. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2759.52s)]
*  Yeah. So let's talk about the future play here. What do you, what, what do you predict is going [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2764.4s)]
*  to happen in the, in the short term, in the next couple of months, specifically in the next 90 days [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2770.16s)]
*  and then the long-term play here? What do you, what do you suspect will happen? [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2776.4s)]
*  I mean, it's these kinds of things. We're in a moment like a fall of 2000, 2008. And those, [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2781.92s)]
*  you know, that run from September 15th through to say late November, December, 2008, it's a very [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2789.04s)]
*  tumultuous, unstable, very hard to predict. What I would say is I suspect that we probably [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2796.88s)]
*  are going to have a lull, at least at a certain phase, a continued lull. We'll have like pockets [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2803.12s)]
*  of more instability and more sort of freak out, but we'll have a kind of lull for like 10, 11 days. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2811.52s)]
*  That'll make a lot of people believe that this is going away and then things will blow up again. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2818.4s)]
*  But that's just like a total speculation guesstimate. That's not something you can [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2823.28s)]
*  kind of rely on. But like these kinds of crises are day-to-day things. Like once you're in one [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2826.8s)]
*  of these crises, it's very hard to even look out at a horizon of 90 days. So it's going to be a day [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2832.8s)]
*  by day. I mean, I've written a piece each day. I've stayed up to eight in the morning writing a piece [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2839.36s)]
*  every single day this week. I'm probably going to take tomorrow to crash a little bit and then [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2843.92s)]
*  write a piece on Friday. We'll see. But like we are in it now. There'll be lulls and certain [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2850.0s)]
*  people will start pontificated about how everyone just had their hair on fire too much. But yeah, [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2858.8s)]
*  that's the core of it. And- So a century of Chinese dominance? [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2864.7200000000003s)]
*  We're just going to be in it. A century of Chinese dominance and Chinese prosperity? [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2871.44s)]
*  January 15th, someone paid me to give a talk. And then at the end, someone walked up to me and [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2877.28s)]
*  asked me like where I see things in 2050. And my answer is just sort of flippantly was 40%, [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2884.88s)]
*  you know, complete global economic collapse, 20% Americans, hegemony manages to limp on, 25% [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2894.2400000000002s)]
*  China, and then, you know, miscellaneous for all sorts of other weird combinations for the last 15%. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2905.44s)]
*  And obviously that was very, very flippant. I guess the numbers now I would put it much more likely [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2912.8s)]
*  Chinese dominance, much less likely US dominance, and more likelihood of just, you know, total [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2917.76s)]
*  global collapse and regionalization of the world. That's just where the perch looks at this incredibly [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2927.1200000000003s)]
*  concerning moment. And that might all seem, you know, this is all without even thinking about [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2934.4s)]
*  what climate change will be at in 25 years. So climate change, you know, climate change is also [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2939.92s)]
*  not priced in. Like they're not in pricing in what Trump and Musk are doing in the payment system. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2946.48s)]
*  They're not pricing in climate change, because the stock market wouldn't, no financial institution [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2952.08s)]
*  in the world would function if they properly priced in climate change. It's just literally impossible. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2957.44s)]
*  And so, you know, there's a lot of just sort of no thing will be dominant because there won't be a [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2962.4s)]
*  world system is a thing on the on the chopping block. But outside of that, yeah, I mean, I think [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2972.8s)]
*  it's a longer conversation about China and why all the things that China, all the reasons that China [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2981.44s)]
*  doesn't want to play that role, and why China has desperately wanted to kind of ride in the sidecar [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2988.5600000000004s)]
*  next to dollar hegemony. But obviously, Trump, Trump is Trump is making that seem just completely [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=2996.24s)]
*  unworkable on a month to month basis, let alone 25 years. So what China does, as it tries to figure [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=3006.24s)]
*  things out, we'll see, China has a lot of its own problems that are barriers to being that kind of, [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=3014.56s)]
*  you know, China doesn't want to become the dominant global currency, where it then has to let everyone [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=3020.08s)]
*  into their financial market and provide the safe assets to the world, which, you know, providing [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=3026.0s)]
*  the safe assets to the world and tight capital controls. They don't go together too well. So [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=3032.32s)]
*  it's a much longer, very different conversation. Yeah, those are governance questions. And the [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=3037.76s)]
*  thing is, like the US has basically been running away from the concept of governance at all. And [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=3044.88s)]
*  that's why all the wheels are falling off. Yeah, no, I, okay. Yeah, no, we're, we're [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=3050.4s)]
*  definitely in agreement on that. Absolutely. I mean, yeah, no, I just wanted to, before we, [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfJBP43Nto&t=3055.6800000000003s)]
