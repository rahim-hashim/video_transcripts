*  Hassan Hassan, the internet's most visible leftist content creator has been beating a similar drum for the past couple of weeks. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2.0s)]
*  There's a cynical right wing framing instead of accurately addressing the real problems that the Democratic Party has. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=7.32s)]
*  While watching a CNN segment in which Democratic strategist Julie Roginski claimed that the party faltered because of social justice jargon and alleged capitulation in the face of student protests at colleges like Columbia University. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=11.56s)]
*  That's a good dad doing the right thing. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=26.68s)]

*  There will never be a liberal Joe Rogan, but the Democratic establishment prefers to ignore what it's already got within the within seconds. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=32.88s)]
*  The left leaning pun is calling for a liberal Joe Rogan day after Trump's reelection. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=39.0s)]
*  The idea had already become a meme at this point, post deriding the notion of the massively popular podcast host, but blue are at least as numerous as the as those sincerely endorsing it. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=41.64s)]
*  The reason is clear. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=51.24s)]

*  But these cries lied a more salient point. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=58.559999999999995s)]
*  There's already a left leaning content creator ecosystem in the Democratic establishment choose to ignore large swaths of it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=61.08s)]
*  For the moment, Democrats remain married networks like MSNBC and CNN, as well as papers like the New York Times, places that will pair the comforting lie that Kamala Harris lost because her campaign, which went hard on topics like a border control and a lethal military.

*  concurrent viewers. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=378.56s)]
*  This put him in league with right-wing heavy hitters like Dan Bongino, Stephen [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=379.52s)]
*  Crowder, Charlie Kirk, Tucker Carlson, pillars of an alternative media apparatus [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=382.16s)]

*  Joe Rogan to other leftist content creators. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=394.76s)]

*  alt media ecosystem that already does exist. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=400.6s)]

*  He's not Charlie Kirk. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=407.72s)]
*  You can say he's part of the manuscript that the Republican party has been courting in [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=408.88s)]
*  this election outreach, but Joe Rogan did not come into his success as a podcaster [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=411.6s)]
*  because he was talking about politics or because he was explicitly a conservative. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=415.56s)]
*  Yes, he endorsed Trump and yes, he certainly believes opinions and believes that are [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=418.68s)]
*  very right-wing in nature, but he also believes in climate change. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=422.08000000000004s)]
*  He's not a straight up right-wing dude. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=424.44s)]
*  And that's why people are drawn to him. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=425.68s)]
*  They're drawn to the culture that Joe Rogan is a part of that he has created and [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=427.16s)]
*  talking about working out, talking about space, talking about being anti-establishment, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=429.96000000000004s)]
*  expressing distrust of authority. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=433.56s)]
*  Joe Rogan is not a Ben Shapiro. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=435.12s)]
*  Admittedly, Rogan is moving extremely far to the right in recent years, embracing [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=436.88s)]
*  numerous conspiracy theories as a result of COVID-19 vaccines and lockdown measures. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=439.88s)]
*  Still, as Quan sees it, there are clear fissures in a right-wing media landscape that [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=443.4s)]
*  people on the outside looking in might be tempted to view as homogenous. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=446.88s)]
*  You have right-wing sphere of commentators like punters like Ben Shapiro. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=450.59999999999997s)]
*  These guys are funded explicitly by right-wing mega donors and corporations. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=453.15999999999997s)]

*  Then you have the group of, for example, Lex Freeman and Joe Rogan and Theo von, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=467.56s)]
*  where they are not explicitly and totally political. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=472.03999999999996s)]
*  It's something where they have conversations with a wide range of people from [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=474.84s)]
*  conspiracy theorists to Marianne Williamson, to Donald Trump, to some random dude [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=478.2s)]
*  off the street. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=481.52s)]

*  extension of a political party. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=485.84s)]

*  But that say other of these content creators is a fundamental misunderstanding of his [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=635.2s)]
*  appeal. He's charismatic, good looking, and he has all the nerd interests that [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=639.28s)]
*  Twitch viewers like. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=642.56s)]
*  He's a cross platform star. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=643.72s)]
*  He has friendships with people who are not political. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=645.2s)]

*  pics and videos of his fits and his fitness progress in addition to streaming [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=672.24s)]

*  Hassan with his himbo aesthetic and working out and all all that is very appealing to [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=676.92s)]
*  a lot of young viewers, a lot of young men who say, yeah, I once upon a time was [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=680.28s)]
*  falling down the alt-right pipeline. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=683.12s)]
*  And then I found Hassan said Quan and now I'm here. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=684.48s)]
*  Piker has also demonstrated a willingness to engage in lengthening conversations, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=687.4s)]
*  for example, as Mungold and face banks, the latter of whom recently endorsed [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=690.04s)]
*  Trump that are Rogan and like Vibe, but the polar opposite in terms of Piker's [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=693.32s)]
*  response to his collaborators, ravings, while things do occasionally get heated. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=696.88s)]
*  For the most part, he listens to what they have to say and draws on a deep well of [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=700.6s)]
*  knowledge to gently push back while avoiding the argumentative fever pitch of [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=704.12s)]
*  a debate. This is the kind of thing Denims, another leftist political streamer, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=707.72s)]
*  thinks the left needs more of. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=710.48s)]
*  I think condescension is a problem that exists on the left and I'm told after [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=712.0400000000001s)]

*  longest time. It's very hard to have positions that are left leaning and then [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=718.48s)]
*  educate on why there are better positions to have without coming off like [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=722.0s)]
*  you're talking down to someone. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=725.04s)]
*  The common sense position on immigration would be, oh, just close all our borders. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=726.4s)]
*  But the reality is that's not what's going to fix the problem, because that's not [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=729.68s)]
*  what the problem is. So now you have to explain what the problem is, the solution [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=732.64s)]
*  to it, and you have to do it all without being a condescending asshole. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=735.68s)]
*  These characteristics, in addition to being in the right place at the right time [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=739.8s)]
*  years ago, have allowed Piker to grow beyond Twitch's relatively narrow [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=742.36s)]
*  confines. In that regard, at least among leftist streamers, he stands alone. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=744.76s)]
*  While the right counts among its ranks, a whole cinematic universe of [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=748.8s)]
*  crowded sized politics, the appers and has managed to lure over ostensibly [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=752.0s)]
*  apolitical figures like Rogan and Ross. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=755.52s)]
*  The left boasts just one Piker and Bose is probably overstating it considering how [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=757.4s)]
*  reluctant the establishment has been to embrace him. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=760.96s)]
*  Other leftist streamers of which there's a growing faction are vastly smaller. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=763.48s)]
*  On a good day, Byers, as he put it, between 10 to 25 percent of Hassan in terms of [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=766.84s)]
*  viewership, Quan, who's friends with Piker, voice concern about being perceived as [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=769.92s)]
*  a Hassan waiting room, which is understandable given how many streamers go [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=773.64s)]
*  live early in the day and tend to wrap up just before Piker tends to log it on [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=776.4s)]
*  in the afternoon. They're effectively feeding off his viewership, something [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=780.0799999999999s)]
*  Quan wants to avoid for fear of cultivating a community that can't grow on [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=782.84s)]
*  its own terms. That just trades the same viewers back and forth at Infinitum. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=786.0s)]
*  My question is, are those just Hassan's viewers, Quan said? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=789.88s)]
*  Will they drop you as soon as Hassan goes live because Hassan is their guy? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=792.36s)]
*  Money talks. But why aren't there more influencers with Piker's size reach and, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=795.36s)]
*  most importantly, impact on the left? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=798.56s)]

*  community. There are plenty of people in his community that don't even fucking [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=815.16s)]
*  like me. As a matter of fact, I love that personally, because this way he gets to [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=818.4399999999999s)]

*  Democratic and Republican establishment choose to back. Part of the role folks [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=839.12s)]
*  like myself is to critique power and present ideas on how to wield power more [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=842.4s)]
*  to the benefit of folks like us working class people said, Jack Riverboat, Jack [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=846.64s)]
*  Gardner, a trans political streamer told the aftermath. That's not just really [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=850.28s)]
*  where the Democratic party has his goals right now. I think they're afraid of [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=853.52s)]
*  tapping into something that's too real to kind of think that Bernie Sanders tapped [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=856.08s)]
*  into in 2016. They're afraid of activating that base because it kind of [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=858.4s)]
*  ruins their ability to reach out to their big money donors. And they aren't [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=861.6s)]
*  bringing enough to the table on the merits of their own policy to actually [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=865.88s)]
*  back up that kind of shift in how to approach politics and communications. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=869.88s)]
*  We'll stop talking politics for the most part, though. We'll never talk about [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=873.6800000000001s)]
*  politics. Republicans are playing by different rules. They're content critters [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=876.36s)]

*  from content critters to Fox News and Newsmax to politicians. The right wing [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=892.56s)]
*  has basically moved towards their YouTubers, which is a terrible thing for [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=896.48s)]
*  all of us. Jacob Geller, a YouTube video essayist whose videos often touch on [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=899.16s)]
*  political subjects told aftermath. The right supports these people with the [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=903.3199999999999s)]
*  establishment. It is really hard to find the separation between what is [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=906.92s)]
*  politically acceptable and what is politically unacceptable and has to be [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=909.24s)]
*  said on a detached podcast because they're all just one big group. Piker grew [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=912.4399999999999s)]
*  organically on Twitch, albeit in part thanks to a significant fame boost [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=917.08s)]

*  Oh, you're at a time when few sizable political streamers exist on the [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=925.96s)]
*  platform and saw smaller streamers have since attempted the following us [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=929.8000000000001s)]
*  footsteps. Meanwhile, right wing influencers on YouTube and other less [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=932.6s)]
*  niche platforms are often manufactured, sometimes in the tune of millions of [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=935.44s)]

*  didn't even have her SM seven be plugged in at the start. Yeah. And we're [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=957.28s)]
*  talking about politics, especially far right policies to be a big no no of [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=961.48s)]
*  influences. Want to sponsor. Ships brands are now more permissive and in [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=964.0s)]

*  influencer machine is insane. Just completely out of control said Geller. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=975.64s)]
*  The left doesn't have that you lose sponsors for talking about Palestine [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=978.88s)]
*  with the funding. Some of these right wing essays, right? We shows get you [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=981.16s)]

*  am a political commentator first and foremost, but I do everything, including [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1013.0s)]
*  Joe Rogan style shit. But you know, the yard would be a great example of like an [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1015.92s)]
*  apolitical show that is still like firmly on somewhat the left. Okay, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1021.8s)]

*  like the basement yard is another one, right? There are plenty of these pockets [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1033.96s)]
*  like PFD at his show at Barstool is again, a leftist not immediately and [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1037.8000000000002s)]

*  it's owned by a few mega conglomerates that buy up all the studios and they [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1089.8s)]

*  intensification? Do you think about the abstract issues of economic production [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1108.84s)]
*  and means of production and rights and esoteric ideas about ownership and [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1112.32s)]

*  to be very, you have to have a very particular set of traits to be able to [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1272.76s)]

*  it's exhausting being a full time political operative in this kind of [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1278.08s)]
*  sphere. I started doing this thing because I love writing about art and [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1280.28s)]
*  video games and I do really enjoy sometimes incorporating explicit [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1283.04s)]
*  politics in my writing. But if somebody told me this is what every video has to [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1285.52s)]
*  be, I think I would just burn out so much more quickly. There's also the issue [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1288.96s)]
*  issue of research. Sarah Z a video essayist who focused on pop culture, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1292.12s)]
*  internet history and fandom pointed to the example the Gravel Institute a [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1296.16s)]

*  under 400,000 subscribers, and they have not put out a video in over two years, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1308.8s)]
*  I don't think their videos are all bad. In fact, I thought their documentary on [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1313.76s)]
*  Cambodia was quite well researched and well crafted, but that's also why it [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1316.6000000000001s)]
*  couldn't work. That's why it couldn't be the new Prager you. It was [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1319.8s)]
*  aesthetically similar in that it was bite sized political content with cute [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1322.88s)]
*  animations, but unless you have a massive amount of money to start with, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1326.0s)]
*  you can't simultaneously be an educational channel and be constantly [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1328.6000000000001s)]
*  producing slot machine. Yeah. The other part of it is money, money, who the fuck [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1330.96s)]
*  would, who, who, who is going to be the singular billionaire or maybe like five [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1336.04s)]
*  to six multimillionaires or billionaires that are going to get together [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1342.36s)]
*  and be like, we value propaganda. That's it. It's not going to happen. You cannot [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1345.6399999999999s)]
*  be a successful, anti capitalist leftist content creator, and also be firmly, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1350.1999999999998s)]
*  firmly defended by corporations. Okay, corporations and massive [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1357.28s)]
*  multi billionaires. Why the fuck? Why the fuck would they ever give money to a [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1362.6s)]
*  guy who says billionaires should not exist? Okay. That's the whole point. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1367.24s)]
*  Republicans don't say billionaires should not exist. They will never say [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1372.36s)]
*  that they say being a billionaire is great. They uplift the lie of [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1375.36s)]
*  meritocracy. Okay. Left wing content requires grassroots fandom and [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1379.0s)]
*  grassroots support. I rely on you guys subscribing to me. Okay. I don't have [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1385.76s)]
*  advertisers. I continue to deny advertisers. I reveal to you on election [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1392.04s)]
*  night that a politics betting platform that I'm offering is a start to the [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1398.32s)]
*  conversation of a million dollars just to be an offer wall to wall advertising [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1402.56s)]
*  on the election day coverage. I said no to that. Okay, it's against my [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1408.12s)]
*  principles. I'll give you another example. The political action committee [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1413.28s)]
*  that I had on, they also offered me a lot of money. I won't say how much, but [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1416.36s)]
*  it was a lot, not a million dollars, but still a lot. I had Rashida Tlaib on, I [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1420.96s)]
*  had them on and I refused to take their payment. I told them to make a [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1426.64s)]
*  donation in my name to an adequate charity instead if they would choose to [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1431.04s)]
*  do so or, you know, spend the money elsewhere. The reason why I did that is [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1436.1200000000001s)]
*  because I don't need money for political advocacy. I do it because I believe it. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1441.32s)]
*  Okay. And there are advertisements I do take up when they offer it to me. There [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1446.4s)]
*  are advertisements I've done on the stream, usually video games, right? But [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1450.72s)]
*  that is the reality. The reality is that this can only work. This can only work [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1454.76s)]
*  if it is an organic movement. Has he addressed the adpocalypse? I mean, what a [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1460.8s)]
*  wonderful question. The adpocalypse, we do not know if it's real or not. But my [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1466.32s)]
*  latest YouTube video, I believe, covers it. This is not a normal switch [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1470.88s)]
*  collapsing. You can go watch it right now. If they wanted to produce content [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1474.44s)]
*  at the same rate as PragerU, they would have to produce content that's worse, at [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1478.72s)]
*  which point we're losing sight of our original goal. If you want to Fox News, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1481.3600000000001s)]
*  Joe Rogan, anything like that, you're asking for an infrastructure system that [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1483.8400000000001s)]
*  needs it. Missing photo succeed. Cat Abu, who makes fun of conservatives from [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1486.3200000000002s)]
*  networks like Fox News on TikTok told Aftermath, I don't think that's [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1490.4s)]
*  necessarily the solution to the problem of right-wing media dominance, making [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1492.92s)]
*  people less informed. Geller believes this same applies to the Rogan of it [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1495.3600000000001s)]
*  all. The reason that the right gets to have their Joe Rogan's and their Ben [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1499.52s)]
*  Shapiro's is because you can make an incredible amount of content when you're [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1502.3200000000002s)]
*  just saying words and never have to verify them with anything. Geller who [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1504.72s)]
*  read a gargantuan book on torture for a recent video on Call of Duty said, it [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1508.2s)]
*  takes a long time to be correct. And it takes a very short time to be wrong. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1512.16s)]
*  It's not that left is never make things up, but it's almost part and parcel with [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1515.16s)]
*  being a right-wing influencer. You just get to go out and speculate on vaccines. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1518.04s)]
*  Whereas the left is not really held to that same standard, nor would leftist [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1521.4s)]
*  want it to be that way. Leftist love being critical of other leftists. And I [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1524.2s)]
*  think if big creators are out there just truly making plat making shit up in the [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1527.32s)]
*  same way that Joe Rogan does, they are not going to maintain a platform because [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1530.8400000000001s)]
*  that's not what people are looking for. Exactly. That's why it's one of the [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1533.48s)]
*  things that frustrates me also all the fucking time when left leaning content [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1536.16s)]
*  creators or people who present themselves as like liberal or apolitical content [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1541.68s)]
*  creators make drama slop about me saying that I fucking misinformed my audience [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1545.48s)]
*  when it's literally not true. That is the reason why random keemstar orbiters that [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1550.0800000000002s)]
*  will turn around and not know a single damn thing about what the fuck they're [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1556.8000000000002s)]
*  talking about in terms of politics. Don't we'll say, Oh, Hassan misinforms [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1560.6000000000001s)]
*  his audience Alex left have fucking presenting an alternative that routinely [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1564.72s)]
*  Mike is bad. Okay, what about now? Is it good? Is it good? My cable [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1572.84s)]
*  disconnecting? Is it good? Now? Is it good? Now? Better? Good. Okay. So people [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1577.28s)]
*  who are keemstar orbiters make fucking drama slop content, they don't know a [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1583.1200000000001s)]
*  single damn thing about the politics that they're speaking on. But then they [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1587.6200000000001s)]
*  will turn around and fucking do drama slop content to be like, Hassan is [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1590.92s)]
*  misinforming his audience as on as a bad debater. Hassan is this as on as [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1593.64s)]
*  that as on as the Alex Jones left. A lot of people find that to be easily [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1596.48s)]
*  consumable. And then they get duped by that. And then, you know, write me off [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1599.96s)]
*  without ever questioning the motives of a person like that. Okay, they never [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1603.48s)]
*  actually seek it out on their own. They never actually turn around and go, [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1608.6000000000001s)]
*  wait, let me take a look at this. Okay. They just man that. Having said that, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1611.92s)]
*  having said that, okay, obviously, there's a reason why for every one of [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1616.76s)]
*  those fucking random losers who don't know a single damn thing about politics [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1621.92s)]
*  or anything that they speak of, or consider themselves to be a political, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1627.8400000000001s)]
*  okay, what, you know, there's a reason why the likes of CNN have presented me [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1632.44s)]
*  as a person that actively targets and combats misinformation online. This is [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1637.88s)]
*  what I do. This is what I do best. actively go after misinformation. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1643.8000000000002s)]
*  unfriendly fire left leaning creators also operate in a more fragile ecosystem [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1648.64s)]
*  than the right wing ones. This is especially notable when it comes to [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1651.52s)]
*  conflicts a little over a year ago, piker and longtime YouTube, Ethan Klein hosted [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1653.44s)]

*  I have nothing to do with it. But other streamers think they at least understand [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1748.76s)]
*  the broad strokes of this issue with big names like Matthew misgive Renaudo [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1752.2s)]

*  They don't even give a single shit about it at all. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1792.12s)]
*  And now you've got random content creators getting screwed over. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1794.2s)]

*  outspoken mainstays. Every platform is doing things that would make advertisers [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1799.28s)]
*  leave. Casey Casey trying said in response to the suggestion that advertisers [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1802.76s)]
*  are getting cold freed is proof that Twitch is in the wrong. Trust me, which [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1806.0s)]
*  is a much better handle on the content of their platform than the plethora of [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1809.36s)]
*  neo-Nazi shit you see on YouTube. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1811.72s)]
*  There just aren't a bunch of no life hall monitor incels reporting it. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1813.6399999999999s)]
*  That's a banger from Casey Tron, by the way. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1817.08s)]
*  It's correct. YouTube is a relevant point of comparison. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1820.0s)]
*  As some creators have begun referring to what's happening on Twitch's own version [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1823.04s)]
*  of YouTube's 2017 apocalypse, a series of advertisers boycotts that forced a [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1825.84s)]

*  targeting systems in the world. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1831.88s)]
*  It remains to be seen whether Twitch will take drastic action. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1833.4s)]
*  One report suggests that the actual number of advertisers pausing spending on [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1836.2s)]
*  Twitch has been limited, but not insignificant. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1839.68s)]
*  Nonetheless, drama farmers like Daniel Keemstar Keem have taken to [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1842.2s)]
*  catastrophizing about the supposed purple-hued adpocalypse for content. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1845.12s)]
*  But over the weekend, the adpocalypse narrative took some period pretty serious [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1848.76s)]
*  hits. The stock guy returned after doing some tinkering and figured out the [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1851.52s)]
*  culprit on his end. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1855.04s)]
*  Turns out he'd previously applied an election tag to his channel. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1856.08s)]
*  Once he removed it, his ad revenue went back to normal. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1859.2s)]
*  This suggests that Twitch is diverting ads from political content. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1861.8s)]
*  Not that advertisers suddenly abandoned the platform in droves. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1864.52s)]
*  There is not a fucking adpocalypse, the stock guy said. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1868.08s)]
*  It's an advertising thing that is happening to specific subsets on the platform. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1870.32s)]
*  I took it off and guess what? [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=1873.56s)]

*  I don't know what my future is going to look like, said Quam, but I really like [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2122.96s)]
*  the fact that I cover a lot of pop culture and I'm a leftist and I try to [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2125.2400000000002s)]
*  fuse the two and teach people, educate people, entertain people, but above all, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2127.5600000000004s)]
*  creating community as a positive one, not where we're just emanating hateful [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2130.32s)]
*  views that are further marginalizing already marginalized people. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2133.6000000000004s)]
*  A lot of what is considered to be quality work coming out of the left is [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2137.52s)]
*  enjoyable because it's what people like Joe Rogan are not tightly scripted, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2140.36s)]
*  well-researched and unambiguous in conclusion, said Sarah Z. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2143.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't think that's a bad thing. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2147.12s)]
*  And I also don't think we should be considering de-radicalization as a [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2148.12s)]
*  primary goal because artful treatment of the news and broader culture is [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2150.2400000000002s)]
*  important, but it's going to influence and create culture with a very different [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2152.76s)]
*  timescale and potential for spread than the reactionary stuff. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2155.36s)]
*  She went on the job parallel between the recent election Democrats spend much of [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2158.6s)]
*  their time reaching for the center and tailoring their message to largely [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2161.76s)]
*  imaginary disaffected Republicans. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2165.08s)]
*  In the end, hardly anybody on the right or left was excited by what they were [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2166.88s)]
*  seeing despite demand for an alt alt media ecosystem. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2171.7599999999998s)]
*  Contra creators didn't fall into the same trap, especially when at the end of [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2175.7999999999997s)]
*  the day is on politicians offer people change worth mobilizing around and not [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2179.2s)]
*  on content creators to prop up dud policies. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2182.72s)]
*  I don't think our goal should be explicit to attract right-wing audiences. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2184.96s)]
*  Sarah Z said, and of course that doesn't mean there's no space for people who [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2187.6s)]
*  don't already agree with us, but as far as I can tell with the recent election [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2191.36s)]
*  conservative voters tend to vote conservative. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2194.8s)]
*  I think this focus on creating a media ecosystem that brings in outsiders and [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2196.6400000000003s)]
*  is less impactful than making work that energizes and educates those who are [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2200.04s)]
*  already willing to listen. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2203.1200000000003s)]
*  I think the strive for conversion as a primary goal is to intentionally create [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2204.44s)]
*  work that's less than substantive. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2207.76s)]
*  Geller hopes that he can at least provide a persuasive alternative to what's out [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2209.4s)]
*  there. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2212.6000000000004s)]
*  Something that sticks in people's minds long enough to maybe change them. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2212.84s)]
*  I don't think that the right provides a very interesting way to critically [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2215.88s)]
*  analyze or take apart art. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2218.6400000000003s)]
*  And so I'm kind of hoping that it is almost implicit in my approach. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2220.76s)]
*  She said, but I would love to happen if somebody is stumbling across YouTube. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2224.52s)]
*  They see one of my videos and watch it and it's considered enough that then they [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2227.68s)]
*  see the contrast with an asthma goal and think, wow, I guess I've been eating trash [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2229.96s)]
*  and I just didn't know until now because I've never eaten anything that wasn't [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2233.2s)]
*  trash. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2236.84s)]
*  Here's something that provides some other version of what this could be. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2237.16s)]
*  Bayer, who is part of the cadre that streams nearly every day, like Piker sees [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2239.56s)]
*  each time he goes live as an opportunity to build and strengthen his community for [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2243.72s)]
*  whatever lies ahead. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2246.08s)]
*  I'm really interested in what will happen when we have as capitalism [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2247.44s)]
*  inevitably does another economic contraction. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2250.24s)]
*  Bayer said, will we have another opportunity? [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2252.52s)]
*  I think the reason why Bernie Sanders was not able to win is because economically [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2256.0s)]
*  in 2016 and 2020, the economy wasn't that bad. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2258.92s)]
*  If the left-wing bubble had happened corresponding with a decline in confidence [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2261.68s)]
*  in capitalism or the markets themselves, it might have been a different outcome. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2264.48s)]
*  So I'm building for the opportunities that lay ahead one day. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2268.24s)]
*  There's really a big silver lining to Kamala Harris losing. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2270.96s)]
*  And that is that the field is open and we'll have nobody to blame but ourselves. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2273.52s)]
*  If we choose to do another Biden, Clinton, Obama or Harris, democratic party. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2276.64s)]
*  That was sick. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2280.72s)]
*  10 10 no notes. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2281.52s)]
*  It's totally possible. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2283.2400000000002s)]
*  It just feels like Devin is just using this to get his name back into the [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2284.1600000000003s)]
*  discussion, but I could also seeing him being involved too. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2286.32s)]
*  I've listened to what he actually has to say on his YouTube channel is very [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2289.04s)]
*  misguided analysis. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2291.36s)]
*  He thinks Twitch reverse was declining because of the content. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2292.8s)]
*  He doesn't even mention the increase in ad density or how Twitch is still far [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2294.96s)]
*  away, the leader in live streaming. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2297.6s)]
*  He directly says either all politics is banned or we have all sides represented. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2299.32s)]
*  It was odd to hear. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2303.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that's yeah. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2304.6s)]
*  That's the real problem with Twitch is that we're not, we don't have damn [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2305.6800000000003s)]
*  Bongino on the platform. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2308.6800000000003s)]
*  Great article. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2310.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's so it's yeah. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2310.7999999999997s)]
*  The real the real problem with the with the website is that there aren't enough [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2313.56s)]
*  Nazis on here. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2317.3599999999997s)]
*  We got to have them on the platform. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2318.2799999999997s)]
*  Meanwhile, everybody fucking shits on kick and kick is in a state of inevitable [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2320.2s)]
*  collapse every other day because they have this, you know, free speech rule, [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2324.7599999999998s)]
*  which is just simply a way to say if you're a fucking neo-Nazi, you can come [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2329.9599999999996s)]
*  in, you can come on this platform. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2333.6s)]
*  Yeah, go read this article and share it with people. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2335.3199999999997s)]
*  We watched the one interview where D seeds are you laughing with two girls is [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2337.7599999999998s)]
*  actually really funny because he acknowledges it hurts his future prospects. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2340.72s)]
*  What? [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2344.3199999999997s)]
*  I don't even know what that is. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2344.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm going to re retweet this. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2346.24s)]
*  This is the best long read. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2347.68s)]
*  Anyway, there's like three really good articles in there. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2349.8399999999997s)]
*  So the one thing I was going to say, the one thing I was going to say is a is a [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2356.4s)]
*  very comprehensive summary and it's really good overall. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2362.96s)]
*  There was another, what the fuck was I going to say? [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2366.72s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2368.88s)]
*  I can't, I can't think. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2369.6s)]
*  Oh, tomorrow, ladies and gentlemen, I will have the legend, the man, the [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2372.52s)]
*  myth, the legend, Dr. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2378.32s)]
*  Mike is retail of the Korean dating sim. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2380.0s)]
*  I'm not going to be able to play tonight. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2382.24s)]
*  I'm tired. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2383.96s)]
*  It's eight hours and 20 minutes in. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2384.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2386.08s)]
*  But tomorrow I will be lifting with the brolic brother, Dr. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2387.16s)]
*  Mike is retail. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2391.92s)]
*  I'm very excited about that. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2392.96s)]
*  That's going to be later in the day. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2394.76s)]
*  And you know, maybe, maybe we'll play the Korean dating sim together. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2396.2400000000002s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2400.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2400.84s)]
*  But that's what I got for today. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2401.48s)]
*  I also saw this and I thought, let them fight. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2402.92s)]
*  Destiny has become increasingly unstable since his wife left. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2405.16s)]
*  Conservatives have been disgusting for years, which is why I don't give a fuck [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2408.12s)]
*  about anybody that winds up at any of these rallies and gets shot or whatever [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2411.52s)]
*  the fuck, okay, because they had no problem making fun of Paul Pelosi. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2413.92s)]
*  The entire world would be better off of these people were permanently [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2416.96s)]
*  removed from these platforms. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2419.64s)]
*  Like there is no downside and only upside to see people like Candice Owens, [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2421.24s)]
*  Tucker Carlson, Tim pool, never be allowed to publicly broadcast their opinions ever [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2424.7999999999997s)]
*  again. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2428.8399999999997s)]
*  It's exclusively bad stuff that happens. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2429.08s)]
*  Conservatives have been disgusting for years, which is why I don't give a fuck. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2431.3999999999996s)]
*  It's so funny that they hate like his best takes, like they just, they hate his [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2435.16s)]
*  best takes like his, his best takes get the most amount of hatred. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2440.64s)]
*  And ironically enough, the shit that I hate him for is not this stuff, but [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2447.04s)]
*  instead is whenever he channels the most edgy and the stupidest fucking right-wing [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2453.0s)]
*  takes overall notice how he didn't mention Ben Shapiro yet, cause he likes [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2459.52s)]
*  Ben Shapiro and agrees with him. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2463.7999999999997s)]
*  His lack of sympathy for a random dude, a rally getting clapped is pretty fucking [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2465.48s)]
*  psycho. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2468.24s)]
*  You don't understand. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2469.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2470.3999999999996s)]
*  For him, it's like the sociopathy is considered a bonus. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2471.4s)]
*  That's it. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2475.96s)]
*  Like he, he thinks it makes him look cool. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2476.76s)]
*  He is. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2480.16s)]
*  And to some losers online, they do actually track that as like being cool. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2481.4s)]
*  They do. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2486.4s)]

*  I'm so glad this guy's doing edgy content. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2490.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2494.08s)]

*  Roseanne Barr, he was married to a woman. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2496.56s)]
*  But yeah, like I'm willing to bet if destiny tomorrow became a right-winger, [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2499.2400000000002s)]

*  I'm a liberal, but I like to say the N word type person that he has presented himself [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2507.84s)]
*  as his audience would not change even a little bit. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2511.6400000000003s)]
*  If anything, his audience would probably grow. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2515.28s)]
*  And that's what's so, that's what's so weird about it. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2518.0800000000004s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2521.2400000000002s)]

*  move an inch. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2526.84s)]
*  They'd be like, Oh, thank God you're finally here. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2528.48s)]
*  So you're assuming right-wing peeps are off the end word. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2530.6s)]
*  No, it's not just him like saying the N word. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2532.48s)]
*  It's that it's that's just one aspect of his commentary. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2534.6s)]
*  He's already there for most of the issues. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2538.7599999999998s)]
*  He's basically Bill Maher. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2540.92s)]
*  He's basically Bill Maher. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2542.44s)]
*  If he came from a message board, if you think about it, no, for sure. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2543.36s)]
*  He is Reddit personified. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2545.88s)]
*  1000%. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2548.16s)]
*  He has to be an edgy boy all the time. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2549.92s)]
*  A little edgy boy. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2552.28s)]
*  I mean, though he's like fucking 40 year old man with a child. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2553.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2557.04s)]
*  He's less successful. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2557.64s)]
*  Reddit Bill Maher. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2558.92s)]
*  Have you seen this? [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2560.56s)]
*  This thing I said in the mogul mail that I think the ad rates will return by [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2561.4s)]
*  December. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2564.6800000000003s)]
*  And it'll be all the way back in a year. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2566.7200000000003s)]
*  I was wrong. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2569.84s)]
*  The ad rates are already back. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2570.64s)]
*  Here is a view of cause I had some actually streamers reach out to me after I [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2572.36s)]
*  made that video after there. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2577.92s)]
*  Cause you know, some people just their ad rates got cut. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2580.88s)]
*  Non-political people. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2583.56s)]
*  I think a lot of people are under the impression that the only people who's [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2584.52s)]
*  ad rates got cut are people who cover the elections or political people or [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2586.72s)]
*  whatever. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2589.68s)]
*  That is not the case. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2590.3999999999996s)]
*  It isn't like a blanket punishment. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2591.9199999999996s)]
*  It seems to be somewhat random. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2594.72s)]
*  But but you can see here October 20, whatever this is third until November [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2599.16s)]
*  or whatever. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2605.3999999999996s)]
*  This is like 11th. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2605.7599999999998s)]
*  So, you know, about a three week period, maybe a little under. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2607.04s)]
*  Did you just say a bunch of shit without any research? [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2613.2s)]
*  He's a repeated shit for Reddit. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2615.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2616.8799999999997s)]
*  I mean, a lot of people do that and it's sad to see because this motherfucker [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2617.9199999999996s)]
*  actually has a journalism degree. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2622.12s)]
*  This streamer who shared their data with me lost basically all their ads, you [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2623.68s)]
*  know, 80% cut in this timeline. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2629.4399999999996s)]
*  All right. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2631.56s)]
*  And he said I could share it. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2631.9599999999996s)]

*  Uh, I know as a, yeah. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2645.12s)]

*  He's in chat. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2649.08s)]
*  Anyone that had a tag that was sexual, political nature, ASMR, Iran were caught [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2650.0s)]
*  up in this student association with geopoliticals in sexual content. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2653.1600000000003s)]
*  I know that as a fact is true, but there are also people who I think are none of [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2656.1600000000003s)]
*  those Pirate Software who also were affected by this, and this is the example I [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2661.0s)]
*  have and I look, I'm telling you right now, although he is good at Super Mario [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2665.7200000000003s)]
*  Jamboree, there was no sexual content there. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2670.6800000000003s)]

*  Rosalina is a bad bitch. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2674.84s)]
*  I agree with you on this point, Thor. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2675.96s)]
*  Me and you are the same. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2677.32s)]
*  We both think Rosalina's a bad bitch. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2678.28s)]
*  Having said that, that is not the reason I think his ad rates got cut. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2681.2400000000002s)]
*  It seems to have affected some other people. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2686.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't, I don't know why. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2689.16s)]

*  Not even a little bit. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2697.48s)]
*  Like not even a, Hey, do you know anything about like this adpocalypse stuff? [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2699.24s)]
*  How it started? [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2705.7599999999998s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2707.6s)]
*  Like I didn't even know that he made a video about this until I saw people [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2709.4s)]
*  yelling at me until I saw people yelling at me that I, that he had made a video [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2714.48s)]
*  about this and that I had somehow, I had somehow stopped him from, you know, or [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2718.92s)]
*  made him delete a part of the video or some shit like that, which is once again, [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2724.44s)]
*  a narrative that like just only exists on Reddit and people are so invested in it. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2729.4s)]
*  Like people just straightforwardly believe it like genuinely, you will never [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2737.36s)]
*  be able to convince those people that that is not what happened. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2741.4s)]
*  And it's so crazy. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2743.96s)]

*  I had no idea that this was fucking happening until people reached out to me. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2792.52s)]
*  Like people that I know in the real world, like fucking big Mike called me and was [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2797.28s)]
*  like, bro, is everything all right? [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2801.84s)]

*  themselves in. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2889.56s)]
*  Like, maybe it's maybe it's a multiple post saying like, no, the apocalypse isn't [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2890.56s)]
*  real. People are clarifying or whatever the fuck. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2896.56s)]
*  I don't know. But it is very strange. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2899.56s)]
*  But this is an example of someone who was maybe he had some wrong. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2903.68s)]
*  Maybe he threw on a political tag while playing Super Mario Party Jamboree. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2907.88s)]
*  But fact remains, even the people who were affected, which I don't know how many [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2912.7999999999997s)]
*  people were because Twitch has not said a word on this, their ad rates seem to be [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2917.64s)]
*  back. They seem to have returned to normal. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2921.24s)]
*  So presumably it'll still continue to affect, you know, with the tag system, the [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2925.12s)]
*  people who are content as it should. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2931.0s)]
*  But it is no longer affecting the people who I think were at least inadvertently [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2933.8s)]
*  affected. That's how I phrase it. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2938.04s)]
*  And that's pretty much it. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2939.4s)]
*  Seems to be back. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2941.12s)]
*  Seems to be a little bit back. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2942.2s)]
*  But yeah, anyway, I basically made one big fuck of my mogul mail. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2944.2s)]
*  I made my mogul mail for streamers who are confused or concerned why their ad [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2947.2s)]
*  rates are going down. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2952.28s)]
*  A lot of people wanted my mogul mail to be the root cause of what started the [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2953.28s)]
*  adpocalypse. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2957.84s)]
*  Brother, I'm not selling those waters. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2958.84s)]
*  I'm not selling those waters. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2960.48s)]
*  OK, the only bay I'm going to is the pirate one. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2962.1600000000003s)]
*  You get me? I'm not selling those waters. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2964.56s)]
*  And so I rewatched my video and I was like, this is exactly what I wanted to make. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2966.76s)]
*  I stand by everything I said in that video. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2971.32s)]
*  Even the Mizkif rephrasing, I don't think was that bad, but he was upset by it. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2974.2400000000002s)]
*  So I don't mind removing it because it didn't add that much to the video. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2977.92s)]
*  And that's it. And that's it. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2980.44s)]
*  And I move on to what I am on this earth to do, which is play League of Legends. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2982.48s)]
*  We all know it's his fault anyway. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2988.56s)]
*  At a subpar level, we have more drama. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2990.6800000000003s)]
*  Ah, we're not done. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2993.0s)]
*  We are not done. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2994.56s)]
*  Uh, there is more drama because this streamer, uh, or I should say this YouTuber, [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=2996.0800000000004s)]
*  because I don't think they're on Twitch, but I don't know if you saw. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=3002.1600000000003s)]
*  They've been calling me out a lot. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=3006.1200000000003s)]
*  All right. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=3008.7200000000003s)]
*  And they've been making a lot of videos about it. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=3009.4s)]
*  And I'm here to fucking finally make a reply. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=3011.1200000000003s)]
*  Phoenix girl day 301. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=3014.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=3018.16s)]
*  I was worried for a second. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=3019.44s)]
*  I was worried for a second. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=3022.16s)]
*  He was going to go into some other shit. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=3023.2400000000002s)]
*  Mini F's coming in. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=3024.96s)]
*  Mini F's coming in. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=3026.48s)]
*  Hold. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiaZEgy3kJY&t=3027.52s)]
