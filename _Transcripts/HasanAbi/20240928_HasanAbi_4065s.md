# Israel's Apartheid Against Palestinians | Hasanabi & nmplol Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [September 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY)
*  we had to send the Arabs away. But the question in that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=0.0s)]
*  situation is, why didn't you let them return to their homes? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  These are civilians. Therein lies the problem. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=7.68s)]
*  I think they came in wanting the whole land from the beginning. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=11.88s)]
*  That's precisely what it is. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=15.52s)]
*  This is Amnesty International. It's a non-governmental [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=21.88s)]
*  organization. It's a human rights group. Okay. They did a [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=25.2s)]
*  video a while back after declaring Israel to be an [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=29.84s)]
*  apartheid regime in the April, the month of April in 2021. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=32.84s)]
*  This is before. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=36.96s)]
*  This is way before. Yeah, because Israel has been an [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=38.76s)]
*  apartheid for a very long time. Do you know what an apartheid [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=41.44s)]
*  is? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=43.6s)]
*  Nelson Mandela. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=44.84s)]
*  Good. Good start. Let's watch this Amnesty International video [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  now. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=49.8s)]
*  Probably the disturbing images of racial segregation between [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=50.64s)]
*  whites and blacks in South Africa, where a regime ruled by [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=54.24s)]
*  a white minority declared themselves officially [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=58.0s)]
*  superiority, then proceeded to dominate them. South Africa's [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=60.84s)]
*  apartheid system officially ended in the mid 1990s. But that [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=64.88s)]
*  doesn't mean apartheid can't happen elsewhere. Here in [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=68.68s)]
*  Israel and the occupied Palestinian, Palestinians are [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=72.32s)]
*  being forced off their land and out of their homes, separated [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=75.4s)]
*  and segregated by laws, walls and checkpoints. They live in a [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=79.12s)]
*  constant state of fear and insecurity and deliberately [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=83.24000000000001s)]
*  impoverished. While on the other hand, Israeli authorities [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=86.72s)]
*  have given the Jewish Israeli population privilege over [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=90.4s)]
*  Palestinians in just about every facet of life. The question is, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=93.24s)]
*  does this all amount to the apartheid? First, the definition [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=98.0s)]
*  of apartheid. The against humanity of apartheid is [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=102.0s)]
*  perpetrated when particular serious human rights are [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=105.36s)]
*  committed with the purpose of establishing and maintaining a [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=108.2s)]
*  system of domination by one racial group over another and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=111.6s)]
*  systematically oppressing them. But does this system exist in [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=115.32s)]
*  Israel and the occupied Palestinians? There's been a [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=119.19999999999999s)]
*  growing debate about whether the situation in Israel and the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=121.72s)]
*  occupied Palestinian is apartheid. And now is the time [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=124.63999999999999s)]
*  for us, as the world's largest human rights organization, to [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=128.95999999999998s)]
*  offer up our analysis, our findings and criticism are [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=133.76s)]
*  directed not at the Jewish people, but at the Israeli [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=137.64s)]
*  state. It's the Israeli state that put in place the policies [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=142.0s)]
*  that implement the laws and the practices that oppress [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=146.32s)]
*  Palestinians. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=149.04s)]
*  Well, Israeli leaders have been clear about their intentions [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=150.48s)]
*  from the beginning. In 1948, just before he became the first [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=153.96s)]
*  Prime Minister of Israel, Ben Gurion visited Lyftah and other [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=157.84s)]
*  Palestinian areas near Jerusalem that were completely emptied of [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=161.8s)]
*  Palestinian residents following attacks by Jewish forces. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=165.4s)]
*  I do want to mention something here because like this is, you're [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=169.2s)]
*  right, a one sided conversation from a trusted third party. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=173.0s)]
*  Having said that, there are a lot a litany of misinformation and [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=177.48s)]
*  cherry pick points throughout history and genuine suppression [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=182.92s)]
*  of the truth in terms of like historic data that Defenders of [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=187.35999999999999s)]
*  Israel has engaged in, in the Western world, especially and in [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=191.84s)]
*  Israel as well, for a very long time. This is precisely the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=195.88s)]
*  reason why a lot of people are also that are educated on the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  matter might actually arrive at an entirely different [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=202.2s)]
*  conclusion. Because the way that this is talking about it is the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=205.35999999999999s)]
*  correct way like is an accurate analysis of the events that [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=209.92s)]
*  unfolded during the Nakba, which means the catastrophe in 1948 [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=214.68s)]
*  when Israel moved on all of the Palestinian villages and like [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=219.51999999999998s)]
*  basically purged Palestinians from their ancestral homelands [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=224.6s)]
*  where they lived in by hundreds of thousands. They moved 750,000 [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=228.4s)]
*  Palestinians from their homes and basically forced them. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=236.48s)]
*  This is 1948. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=240.04s)]
*  1948. Yeah, just after World War Two. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=241.16s)]
*  And it's going to describe that right now. But the way that [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=244.84s)]
*  people who want to defend Israel, I'll just give you the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=250.32s)]
*  alternative argument, I'll steel man their position as well. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=252.36s)]
*  Those who are Defenders of Israel will say, actually, no, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=256.2s)]
*  that's not what happened. These Arabs as a collective were [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=260.12s)]
*  always angry at the Jews because they had anti-Semitism at their [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=263.16s)]
*  hearts. And they always wanted to, you know, not live alongside [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=266.52000000000004s)]
*  Jews because they hate Jews. Like, it's almost like a false [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=270.64s)]
*  notion of anti-Semitism created amongst the Arab population in [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=275.68s)]
*  the minds of Defenders of Israel to make it seem as though like [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=279.08s)]
*  they have almost a Hitlerian, like Nazi style anti-Semitism. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=282.64s)]
*  They'll even point to like a Grand Mufti, a Palestinian Grand [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=285.8s)]
*  Mufti, a religious leader that was actually a colonial religious [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=288.2s)]
*  leader that the British Empire had placed in position of power, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=291.8s)]
*  but that wasn't ultimately a popular person at all to be like, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=296.2s)]
*  oh, Hitler literally talked to this guy actually, and he's the [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=299.47999999999996s)]
*  one who told Hitler to Jews, right? Which is revisionism. And [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=302.76s)]
*  it's revisionism that was actually repeated by Benjamin [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=308.52s)]
*  Netanyahu, as a matter of fact, saying that the Palestinian Grand [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=312.12s)]
*  Mufti played a prominent role in getting Hitler to be anti-Semitic [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=316.68s)]
*  and do the final solution is unimaginable revisionism. Only [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=321.2s)]
*  Nazis would believe that, which Benjamin Netanyahu is. Anyway, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=324.68s)]
*  there is a lot of there are a lot of counters. There are a lot [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=328.2s)]
*  of counter arguments to everything that they're talking [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=332.4s)]
*  about. But this is an accurate assessment of the truth. Okay. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=335.84s)]
*  And if you are unfamiliar with the counter arguments, and if [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=339.84s)]
*  you're if you haven't done the reading, people who are at least [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=344.03999999999996s)]
*  propagandists that want to make the truth seem different, will [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=347.59999999999997s)]
*  be able to effectively wind you down. Okay, will be affected [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=352.23999999999995s)]
*  will be able to effectively make you make it seem like you're [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=357.2s)]
*  wrong. Right? Anyway, let's continue. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=360.0s)]
*  He stated, there are no Arabs, 100% Jews, if we persist, it is [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=363.0s)]
*  quite possible that in the next six or eight months, there will [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=368.20000000000005s)]
*  be considerable changes in the country, very considerable, and [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=371.48s)]
*  to our advantage. More than 70 years later, then Prime [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=375.40000000000003s)]
*  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu posted on Instagram that Israel [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=379.52000000000004s)]
*  is not a state of all its citizens, but rather the nation [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=383.56s)]
*  state of the Jewish people and only them. So it's no surprise [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=387.24s)]
*  that Israel built a system of racially laws, policies and [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=391.8s)]
*  practices that privilege only Jewish people and Palestinians. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=395.08s)]
*  Well, Palestinians live there too. They were there before [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=399.40000000000003s)]
*  Israel was established. But as we will explain, they've been [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=402.6s)]
*  trapped for decades in a system that treats them as a lesser [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=406.68s)]
*  non Jewish racial group. Before Israel was established in 1948. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=410.16s)]
*  Palestinians comprised most of the population around 70% and [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=415.12s)]
*  owned the vast majority of private land, about 90% in what [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=419.36s)]
*  was British Mandate Palestine. Jews, many of whom had emigrated [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=423.2s)]
*  from Europe, comprised around 30% of the population, and they and [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=427.76s)]
*  Jewish institutions owned about 6.5% of the land. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=432.48s)]
*  The port of Haifa in Palestine lies shattered by them strewn [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=436.8s)]
*  with death. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=439.68s)]
*  In the course of establishing Israel as a Jewish state in 1948, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=440.32s)]
*  Israeli authorities acted to turn the situation on its head [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=444.56s)]
*  and were responsible for the mass expulsion of Palestinians and [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=448.32000000000005s)]
*  the destruction of hundreds of villages, forcing around 800,000 [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=451.76000000000005s)]
*  Palestinians [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=456.20000000000005s)]
*  here and just took the shits. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=457.88000000000005s)]
*  Thousands of Palestinians and Jews were in the counter to this [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=459.72s)]
*  illegally is is like, Oh, well, happen. These people were not [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=463.56s)]
*  responsible for it. As a matter of fact, 11,000 Palestinians [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=467.52000000000004s)]
*  fought against Nazi Germany, but it doesn't matter as besides [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=470.8s)]
*  the point. But basically, this is what settler colonialism is. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=474.72s)]
*  And ultimately, the way that like in Israeli society, the way [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=479.12s)]
*  that this is these events are explained is, is totally [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=483.0s)]

*  Jews fought back. So we had to send the Arabs away. But the [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=491.04s)]
*  question in that situation is, why didn't you let them return [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=495.44000000000005s)]
*  to their homes? These are civilians. Therein lies the [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=499.36s)]
*  problem. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=502.96000000000004s)]
*  I think I think they came in wanting the whole end from the [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=504.16s)]
*  beginning. That's precisely what it is. And this is just what [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=506.64000000000004s)]
*  it's come down to. Ultimately, that is the the final evolution [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=510.08000000000004s)]
*  of Zionism which is happening currently. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=514.0400000000001s)]
*  In the context of attacks on civilians during this conflict. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=518.2s)]
*  Today, there are around 6 million Palestinian refugees who [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=522.16s)]
*  Israel denies the right to return to their homes. After the 1967 [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=526.12s)]
*  war, Israel occupied the Palestinian of the West Bank, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=530.96s)]
*  including East Jerusalem and Israel's brutal military rule. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=534.24s)]
*  I didn't want to tell you like the psychotic that they did [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=538.96s)]
*  during the Nakba from 1947 onwards, planned Dalit. These [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=541.64s)]

*  Israeli historians, by the way. And, and ironically, one of the [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=551.6s)]
*  formative Israeli historians basically uncovered it, and then [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=559.6s)]
*  changed his position to Yeah, it was ethnic cleansing and it was [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=563.56s)]
*  planned, but it was good. I'm glad that it happened. And the [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=567.24s)]
*  others were like, this was completely unacceptable. What [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=569.84s)]
*  the f***? One of which is historian Ilan Pappé, Israeli [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=572.64s)]
*  historian Ilan Pappé. He's an award winning Israeli historian, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=577.84s)]
*  who was an academic in Israel who left Israel. And I think he [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=581.6s)]
*  like literally gave up his citizenship to is like the [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=584.84s)]
*  Avish lame Ilan Pappé. And the last historian that I'm talking [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=588.68s)]
*  about is Benny Morris. Benny Morris is the one who was like, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=594.1999999999999s)]
*  yes, ethnic cleansing happened, but it was good. I mean, good [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=597.04s)]
*  for for one side, right? Yeah. Okay. This is one of the many [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=599.48s)]
*  things that they designed as paramilitaries attacked the [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=603.4s)]
*  village of Deir Yassin. A lot of the stuff that they talked [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=606.04s)]
*  about during October seven was shit that like Israel had done [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=610.0s)]
*  in Deir Yassin, throwing babies in ovens and things like that. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=613.0s)]
*  Sorry, what? With your babies in ovens? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=616.36s)]
*  I thought Ilan Pappé renounced his citizenship. Maybe I'm [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=618.12s)]
*  wrong. No, Norm is not a part of the group of historians from [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=621.0s)]
*  Israel. Norm is not Israeli. And Norm is an incredible and very [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=624.5200000000001s)]
*  accurate chronicler of the fate of the Palestinians post 1948. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=630.48s)]
*  Holy moly, dude, this is this is heavy. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=637.2s)]
*  Coupled with the establishment and expansion of illegal Jewish [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=640.2800000000001s)]

*  No, I asked a question that who threw the baby in the oven? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=652.2s)]
*  Oh, in Deir Yassin, Zionist paramilitaries, including like [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=654.96s)]
*  actual paramilitaries that call themselves organizations like [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=659.76s)]
*  personally engaged in atrocities in an effort to basically and [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=662.8000000000001s)]
*  like let some people live in the villages and the Palestinian [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=669.88s)]
*  villages that were literally like unguarded. There was no not [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=672.44s)]
*  a single person there with like weapons. One of the one of the [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=675.1600000000001s)]
*  most like gruesome acts of horror was when these came into [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=679.44s)]
*  the village. And they obviously had a bunch of these people at [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=683.72s)]
*  gunpoint. And they there was a there was a baker. And he had [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=687.44s)]
*  this big oven for baking bread. And they took the baker and they [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=692.44s)]
*  told the baker you have to throw your own son in the oven. The [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=696.9200000000001s)]
*  baker refused. So they threw his son in the oven and made the [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=700.16s)]
*  baker watch his son burn alive in the oven. And they threw the [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=704.3199999999999s)]
*  baker in the oven. The only reason why we know about this is [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=707.76s)]
*  because the third person that experienced this that was on [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=710.4s)]
*  that lineup escaped. And, and, and basically, the reason why [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=713.48s)]
*  they let a lot of these people escape in the villages after [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=718.9399999999999s)]
*  doing like insane atrocities to them, like rape, straight up [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=722.3199999999999s)]
*  like raping them, raping them to death, a bunch of people. The [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=726.04s)]
*  reason they would let people escape is so that they wanted [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=729.8s)]
*  the Palestinians to go to other Palestinian villages and say [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=732.24s)]
*  this is what they did to us leave when they come. So they [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=734.42s)]
*  would do like some of the earliest aspects of PsyOps [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=738.24s)]
*  basically, they would go into like major cities. And they [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=741.3599999999999s)]
*  would have these big speakers on armored cars. And the speakers [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=744.5s)]
*  would be blasting like machine gunfire and explosion sounds. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=748.0799999999999s)]
*  They didn't actually have the you know, they weren't they [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=751.76s)]
*  didn't want to use the machine gunfire, whether it was because [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=753.66s)]
*  they just didn't have a lot of resources or whatever. But they [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=757.04s)]
*  basically would surround the city with military and run these [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=760.0799999999999s)]
*  like crazy sounds to make people evacuate. Yeah, would basically [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=764.36s)]
*  surround the city so they can only evacuate from one single [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=768.8s)]
*  file line out of one area of the city. And they would obviously [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=771.28s)]
*  never let them return ever again after evacuating the entire [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=775.3199999999999s)]
*  city. That's how they got all the land. Yeah, they didn't [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=778.48s)]
*  everyone but they enough people I think was 15,000 if I'm not [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=780.7199999999999s)]
*  mistaken. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=783.84s)]
*  880 K that's what they said got moved. No, no, no, that's the [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=785.48s)]
*  total number of people that were ethnically displaced. Okay. But [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=789.44s)]
*  in terms of like directly them like 15,000 people, but they use [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=792.48s)]
*  the deaths and the lynchings and the rapes to basically scare [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=796.36s)]
*  the 750,000 ethnic Palestinians into leaving. And then they [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=800.88s)]
*  still to this day say, Oh, well, they voluntarily left. Okay, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=806.84s)]
*  they voluntarily want to come back. They would not allow that [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=810.0400000000001s)]
*  to happen. They shot a bunch of people that tried to come back [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=812.66s)]
*  to their own farms and um, yeah. So now ask us on about Turkey [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=814.9s)]
*  and what they do to the Kurds. I mean, I've talked about this [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=819.78s)]
*  quite a bit. But one ironic part about this is that like, you [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=821.8199999999999s)]
*  know, if Israel treated Palestinians in the same way [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=826.1s)]
*  that like the Turkish government treats cars, which is still [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=830.62s)]
*  horrifying, especially when you look at Kurdish majority areas [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=833.42s)]
*  where Turks like the Turkish military literally engages in [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=837.26s)]
*  like military action. Having said that, however, if the [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=839.7s)]
*  Israeli military treated or the Israeli government treated and [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=842.82s)]
*  offered full blown citizenship to every single Palestinian [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=846.3000000000001s)]
*  person and consider them simply an ethnic minority, but they [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=849.96s)]
*  have the same rights, even though there is still a lot of [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=852.58s)]
*  this would be declared the greatest human rights [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=855.86s)]
*  achievement of all time. And I don't think there's a single [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=858.26s)]
*  Kurdish person that would disagree with what I'm saying [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=861.26s)]
*  here. Yeah, for the record, Darius in another massacre were [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=863.34s)]
*  carried out by Irgun and Lee he paramilitaries that were folded [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=866.1800000000001s)]
*  into the modern idea by the state. These are not some sort [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=868.88s)]
*  of rogue entities. They're pertinent to the conflict as an [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=872.12s)]
*  entity. Yeah, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=874.36s)]
*  objective, maintain Jewish Israeli hegemony and maximize [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=875.28s)]
*  control of land in the city of Jerusalem. The Israeli official [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=879.4s)]
*  policy is to maintain at least a 60% Jewish majority. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=883.0s)]
*  Now is a once in a lifetime opportunity, not only to stand [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=889.28s)]
*  within its gates, but also to build the home of your dreams [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=893.28s)]
*  and we had it Israel feel about the Holocaust. So where do all [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=897.0400000000001s)]
*  the Palestinians live? I don't think they're like 3.4 million [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=899.6400000000001s)]
*  live outside of Israel, mainly in refugee camps in neighboring [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=902.96s)]
*  countries. They're trying to run it back. But in their favor. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=907.72s)]
*  Yeah, that actually what you just described is like [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=911.8000000000001s)]
*  literally, it plays a very formative role in the Israeli [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=914.48s)]
*  nationalistic mythos. The Holocaust is like, first of all, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=918.36s)]
*  Israel didn't exist when the Holocaust was happening. You [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=922.44s)]
*  know that, right? I don't know anything. Think about the [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=925.52s)]
*  timeline 1948. I'm learning now. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=928.04s)]
*  How they feel about it now. So the Holocaust plays a incredibly [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=932.6s)]
*  important and very instructive role in the in the building of [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=937.28s)]
*  the Israeli nation state. And it is a part of like the national [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=943.1999999999999s)]
*  mythmaking for Israel. The analysis is that before the [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=947.56s)]
*  Holocaust, there were also literally centuries of pogroms [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=951.4399999999999s)]
*  where, you know, blood libel, everyone anytime in any Russian [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=954.4s)]
*  village or in Europe or whatever, something bad was [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=959.24s)]
*  happening, they'd be like, Oh, it must be the Jews that are [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=961.52s)]
*  doing that. So what would they do? They would go and find all [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=963.0799999999999s)]
*  the Jews and them or purge them. So Jewish people have a very [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=965.76s)]
*  long history of consistently getting slaughtered. Why [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=969.3199999999999s)]
*  mercilessly? There was one exception, however, yeah, the [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=974.04s)]
*  Ottoman Empire lays myself too much, but the Ottoman Empire was [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=977.6s)]
*  safe haven for Jews. And a lot of Jews actually escaped the [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=980.56s)]
*  Spanish Inquisition and came to the Ottoman Empire and lived in [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=985.4799999999999s)]
*  many different parts of the Ottoman Empire, including but [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=988.88s)]
*  not limited to historic Palestine. And at the time, it [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=991.2399999999999s)]
*  was seen as like a significantly better living experience for [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=994.7199999999999s)]
*  Jews in terms of like Europe in comparison to Europe. But that's [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=998.52s)]
*  besides the point. So what I was saying was, what was I saying? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1002.5999999999999s)]
*  He doesn't know what that means. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1007.4s)]
*  I assume that has to do with Turkey. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1008.64s)]
*  Um, no, I [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1010.04s)]
*  Oh, centuries of pogroms and the Holocaust. So centuries of [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1012.88s)]
*  pogroms and the Holocaust itself was was like a like a enough is [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1016.4399999999999s)]
*  enough moment for a lot of people, I think, where some [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1022.0799999999999s)]
*  internalize the the message behind never again as like, you [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1027.24s)]
*  know, we can never allow this to happen to anyone ever again, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1032.6399999999999s)]
*  which is the correct message. That's the reason why that [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1035.8s)]
*  message exists. And others, namely, those who are at the [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1037.76s)]
*  helm of spearheading Israeli society and building this nation [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1043.72s)]
*  saw that as never again to us. Like just, you know, nobody else [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1047.6s)]
*  I don't give a f we will do it ourselves actually, even if if [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1052.68s)]
*  that's what it takes, but never again to us. So it's the way I [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1055.72s)]
*  think that the Holocaust is viewed is like very complicated [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1061.04s)]
*  in Israeli society where like, there's almost an air of like [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1063.56s)]
*  resentment towards Jews that survived the Holocaust or [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1067.52s)]
*  escaped the Holocaust, where they are seen as like weak by [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1070.76s)]
*  depending on what level of mania you're operating on where like [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1076.0s)]
*  there are a lot of hyper right wing Israeli nationals who [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1079.24s)]
*  consider like, Jews during the Holocaust to be weak, they [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1084.04s)]
*  didn't fight back, they didn't fight back enough, which is, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1087.16s)]
*  again, a historical, because they did fight back. That's the [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1089.52s)]
*  Warsaw ghetto uprising, which is analogous to, you know, October [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1093.04s)]
*  seven in many respects, but and that they did not know that [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1096.8s)]
*  they were being sent to death camps, many Jews did not know [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1103.12s)]
*  that they were being sent to death camps with the idea is [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1105.3999999999999s)]
*  like, um, yeah, the idea is that they were weak Jews, and we [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1107.1599999999999s)]
*  will never be like them, we will be strong Jews. And, and I [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1112.04s)]
*  think that's part of the reason why Israeli society is so [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1115.36s)]
*  militant, so hyper militant, one, because it's a settler [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1119.2s)]
*  colony, in the middle of a region where it's like actively [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1122.04s)]
*  purged the ethnic population. So obviously, there's gonna be a [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1125.36s)]
*  lot of resentment towards that. But beyond that, it's the like [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1128.6399999999999s)]
*  the genuine, I think like a quite reasonable assessment of [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1134.8s)]
*  the situation as a if you parse through Jewish history, like it [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1139.6799999999998s)]
*  is understandable, bro, if your people are getting constantly [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1146.04s)]
*  everywhere, and being made to be the only reason why bad things [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1148.6s)]
*  are happening, then yeah, you're gonna be like, holy, we [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1153.64s)]
*  need to have we cannot have this happen again, we got to be like [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1156.72s)]
*  super militant. And I think that that complicates things a [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1159.4s)]
*  little bit if you're Jewish and learning about Jewish history, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1162.6000000000001s)]
*  or if you're like a little bit interested about, you know, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1166.76s)]
*  Jewish history, I think that that is what complicates [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1169.48s)]
*  things because there is an air of legitimacy to the [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1173.0400000000002s)]
*  generational trauma that Jewish people have experienced. Yeah, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1175.5200000000002s)]
*  the problem is, that generational trauma has caused [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1178.96s)]
*  Jews to be at the forefront of every single civil justice, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1183.68s)]
*  social justice movement, civil liberty movement, including the [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1189.7600000000002s)]
*  abolition of apartheid South Africa. So while Israel was in [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1193.5200000000002s)]
*  support of apartheid South Africa, Jews played a prominent [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1197.5600000000002s)]
*  role in South African these the fight against the South African [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1201.7600000000002s)]
*  apartheid. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1205.5600000000002s)]
*  Why was Israel for it? [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1206.92s)]
*  Well, because they had their own apartheid. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1208.08s)]
*  And they wanted nukes, I think. I think that was what it was, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1210.12s)]
*  right? Didn't they? Didn't they get like, they developed their [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1212.96s)]
*  nuclear capabilities by collaborating with South Africa, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1216.4s)]
*  I think? Am I mistaken on that? [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1219.16s)]
*  So Israel has nukes? [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1220.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1222.6s)]
*  And we still give them weapons? Why? [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1223.12s)]
*  Well, because they have nukes. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1225.28s)]
*  Oh, no. Oh, no. One of your viewers just typed in word. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1228.04s)]
*  0.5 million Palestinians live in Israel and East Jerusalem, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1232.6s)]
*  restricted to enclaves that make up around 3% of the entire [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1236.2s)]
*  area. I remember 3 million Palestinians live in the occupied [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1240.44s)]
*  West Bank, but are only allowed to access 40% of the land to live [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1244.04s)]
*  and work. The rest of the area is for the Jewish Israeli [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1248.6s)]
*  settlers. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1252.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1252.6s)]
*  2 million are trapped. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1253.84s)]
*  So depends. The ones that are heavily restricted in their [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1254.84s)]
*  movement. The ones in the West Bank are also heavily restricted [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1259.0s)]
*  in their movement. Israel does something really tough where if [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1262.24s)]
*  you leave the West Bank as a Palestinian resident in the West [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1265.28s)]

*  come back. If you have residents in America as a Palestinian, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1274.3999999999999s)]
*  they still make it really hard for you to go there and visit, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1277.52s)]
*  but you can go and visit because they're like, yeah, you're [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1279.92s)]
*  gonna often you're gonna go back to America or wherever you're [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1281.8s)]
*  from. But if you are a Palestinian resident of the West [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1283.8799999999999s)]
*  Bank, and you leave the West Bank, they make it like as [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1288.56s)]
*  difficult as possible to to make sure that you can't come back [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1294.28s)]
*  into the West Bank. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1297.6399999999999s)]
*  Man, this is just insane. I'll be honest, man. It's not like [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1298.92s)]
*  this whole area needs a nice reset, you know? [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1302.0s)]
*  Okay, bro. But, you know, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1305.0s)]
*  give it to me. Let me start my palm is on there. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1306.92s)]
*  Okay, but you have to remember like, what innocent people didn't [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1310.08s)]
*  do. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1313.84s)]

*  Like when you learn this stuff, your thing your argument [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1318.0s)]
*  shouldn't be like, Oh, man, it's just too complicated for me. Like [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1320.84s)]
*  let God sort it out. Because God doesn't end up sorting it out. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1323.84s)]

*  Israel and the occupied Palestinian wherever they may [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1374.0s)]

*  and maintained for decades. And it's that system that is the root [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1381.2s)]

*  an Israeli citizen, if you're an Israeli Jew, right, because [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1694.76s)]
*  Israel has its own demographics, which is really funny, because [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1697.64s)]
*  like, Israel is relatively diverse in terms of like, the [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1700.5200000000002s)]
*  actual ethnic backgrounds. Because there's plenty of Arab [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1704.72s)]
*  Jews as well, right? Like if you were to if I were to put a lineup [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1708.72s)]
*  and be like, which one is passing, which one's Israeli, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1711.88s)]
*  you would not be able to tell them apart. They all look [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1714.72s)]
*  diverse, like there's white ones. And then there's brown [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1717.8000000000002s)]
*  ones and even black ones, right? And black what? Jews, and [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1721.04s)]

*  be Ethiopian chat? Probably darker. And the same goes for [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1740.2s)]
*  Arabs. Anyway, yeah. Israeli society has created because of [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1743.1599999999999s)]
*  because of its its ethno state status. Israeli government has [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1747.88s)]
*  created a designation. There's two tiers. You're either an [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1751.92s)]
*  Israeli citizen like full blown citizen, which means you're [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1755.5200000000002s)]
*  Jewish, or you are a non Jew living inside of Israel. We [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1757.96s)]
*  call that the Palestinian citizens of Israel, the 1948 [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1763.5600000000002s)]
*  years, the people that were there that were offered [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1766.3600000000001s)]
*  citizenship at the time. The only thing that makes them [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1768.5200000000002s)]
*  different from like full blown Israeli Jews, is that they're [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1771.68s)]
*  just not Jewish, that they're either Christian or Muslim. Now, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1776.36s)]
*  here's where things get interesting. Okay, there are [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1781.3999999999999s)]
*  Arab Jews. Itamar Ben Givir is the is the the Ministry of like [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1784.6799999999998s)]
*  Interior Defense or whatever, like the National Police guy, [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1791.1999999999998s)]
*  right? He's from Iraq. He's Arab, but he's Jewish. So even [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1794.4799999999998s)]
*  if you're Arab, you still get slotted into Jewish as your [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1800.8s)]
*  ethnic and religious background. And what's really [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1805.64s)]
*  interesting about this process is that if you are an Israeli [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1809.6000000000001s)]
*  Jewish citizen, right, regardless of where you're from, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1812.6000000000001s)]
*  and you want to marry a Palestinian Muslim in the West [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1815.8400000000001s)]
*  Bank, you can't bring the Palestinian Muslim from the West [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1819.1200000000001s)]
*  Bank into Israel. Even if you get married, you have to live in [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1822.44s)]
*  the West Bank. Now, you can your citizenship only goes down, like [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1825.24s)]
*  you only get level down, you can't level up. Okay, that is [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1829.4s)]
*  I've had a conversation with a with a literal Arab with a Jewish [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1834.2s)]
*  Arab from Israel teenager. And in the conversation, I tried to [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1837.4s)]
*  explain to him that like he's technically Arab as well, or [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1840.84s)]
*  Itamar Ben Givir is Arab. And he got mad at me. He was like, no, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1844.04s)]
*  they're not Arab. The reserve, they reserve the term only for [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1846.96s)]
*  non Jews calling an Israeli Jew an Arab is like calling them a [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1850.48s)]
*  slur there. Yeah. Okay, Hassan, help me here. What's an Arab? I [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1853.1200000000001s)]
*  don't understand what you're saying. Arabs are of a specific [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1859.04s)]
*  ethnic background from Arab countries like predominantly [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1863.12s)]
*  Arab countries. Right. Okay, so where you're born at it, it's [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1866.0s)]
*  that it speak Arabic. So you can be Jewish if you're born in an [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1869.12s)]

*  used to live in Arabic countries. Some of them. Yeah, [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1876.8799999999999s)]
*  some of them were literally after Israel was developed as a [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1879.32s)]
*  nation state, some of them were purged from the Arabic nations [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1882.12s)]
*  because they had their own pan Arabic or their own nationalist [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1885.28s)]

*  literally were forcing them out. Or Israel also personally, like [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1891.92s)]
*  in the case of Iraq was making it so that it would do false flag [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1896.8000000000002s)]
*  attacks like synagogues. Israel would a synagogue in Iraq to be [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1900.4s)]
*  like, see, they hate you. Yeah, Israel now. So let me get this [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1902.92s)]

*  if you're Jewish, you're not. Israel has actually a separate [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1936.0s)]

*  lot to take in one day, guys. I apologize. It's just a lot to [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1947.52s)]

*  good. You know, because I'm just getting confused here. If you [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1957.0s)]
*  are if you are an Israeli Jew of Arab descent, you have a [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1960.48s)]

*  like what your background is, there's a separate designation [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1971.6s)]
*  for it's called Mizrahi. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1975.28s)]
*  And is that frowned upon? No, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1976.6399999999999s)]
*  okay. Originally, when they were first coming into Israel, they [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1979.6s)]
*  were frowned upon the there was a lot of issues with integration [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1982.0s)]
*  of Mizrahi Jews into Israeli society. I don't want to really [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1985.24s)]
*  get into that. But like they used to call them like, he [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1987.8s)]
*  considered them barbarians, like, oh, you need to learn how [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1990.0s)]
*  to there was definitely a Ashkenazi supremacist undertone [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1992.52s)]
*  to a lot of this stuff. And there still kind of is in Israel. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=1997.36s)]
*  Ashkenazis are Eastern European and white Jews, many of which [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2001.52s)]
*  that you know, live in the United States of America as well. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2006.4s)]
*  So like, there is definitely colorism in Israel as well. They [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2009.3600000000001s)]
*  did a sterilization operation on Ethiopian Jews specifically [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2012.48s)]
*  because they claimed it was so that they would stop birth [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2015.84s)]
*  defects, but it was actually stop having children, because [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2018.52s)]
*  they wanted to continue the Western European style, nature [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2022.56s)]
*  of Israel. Israel, Israel also engaged in ecological [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2030.64s)]
*  ecological colonialism, where they would like raise all the [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2034.76s)]
*  Arab villages change the villages to sound more Israeli [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2037.96s)]
*  in name like Hebrew. They also did like really unique. I mean, [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2042.24s)]
*  Hebrew as a language was basically revitalized, like it [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2046.4s)]
*  is not a it was a dead language. Ultimately, most Jews like [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2050.48s)]
*  spoke Yiddish or whatever the language that they spoke in [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2054.88s)]
*  their nation of origin. And then they literally [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2057.08s)]
*  single handedly in this nation state project revived a dead [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2060.12s)]
*  language, brought it to the forefront. Unfortunately, some [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2063.88s)]
*  of the consequences were like the desecration and destruction [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2067.64s)]
*  of Yiddish because of some of the similar, you know, cultural [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2071.44s)]
*  aspects of Yiddish that I explained, or cultural remnants [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2076.7999999999997s)]
*  of like, the way that some of Israeli society internalize the [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2080.08s)]
*  Holocaust or how they look at the Holocaust. But I have heard [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2085.48s)]
*  of the word Yiddish chat. Okay, someone said Nick hasn't heard [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2089.4s)]
*  of the word. It's not entirely accurate. I mean, it's I think [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2091.92s)]
*  it's like, yeah, it was almost an entirely liturgical language [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2094.2s)]
*  like Latin. I think that I think that like, if Israel wasn't [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2097.4s)]
*  such a and and a bloody permanent occupation, settler [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2103.04s)]
*  colonial occupation, like, there is a lot of phenomenal [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2108.48s)]
*  achievements that you could point to, including literally [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2111.8s)]
*  like the revitalization of a language such as Hebrew, in such [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2114.52s)]
*  a short period of time, I think that the problem is it came [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2119.2s)]
*  alongside the destruction. But in terms of like the ecological [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2123.96s)]
*  that I was referencing, they literally would raise these [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2127.92s)]
*  villages change the language or change the name of the villages [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2130.72s)]
*  to like, you know, either biblical or, or not even [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2134.0s)]
*  biblical, but like they would change into like Hebrew words. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2136.56s)]
*  But then also they would destroy the olive trees, all trees take [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2139.48s)]
*  hundreds of years to grow and bear fruit as efficiently as [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2142.36s)]
*  they can in Palestine. And they would burn all trees down and [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2146.96s)]
*  they would plant European style trees. They would pay they [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2151.4s)]
*  would plant trees that like resembled the European fauna. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2155.96s)]
*  And yeah, like pine trees. And obviously, punches like exist [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2161.88s)]
*  in Lebanon too. But like, basically, they changed the [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2165.1200000000003s)]
*  ecology of the of the entire area, or not the fauna, the [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2169.24s)]
*  flora, sorry. And what ended up happening is like now they're [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2174.12s)]
*  they have a higher likelihood of, of having like wildfires, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2178.2599999999998s)]
*  because it's like such a dry area that it's not supposed to [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2183.68s)]
*  be shouldn't have done it then. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2186.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2187.64s)]
*  Anyway, so yeah, they engage in ecological fascism. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2189.56s)]
*  I have another dumb question. Yeah. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2192.8799999999997s)]
*  For like Gaza and like West Bank, do they have internet? [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2195.96s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. So there's a couple different processes. One now [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2198.68s)]
*  former Hassan Abed who was ex Israeli state. Excuse me, would [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2203.92s)]
*  one of your viewers was executed by a bunch of my viewers? Yes. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2208.7999999999997s)]

*  him. There's a video of him explaining the process of using [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2220.16s)]
*  eSIMs. And they yeah, an internet cafe. Oh, brother, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2222.52s)]

*  his name is Meadow. Anyway, he was a tick tocker. And he loved [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2243.9199999999996s)]
*  a growing plant. He had like a like a miniature greenhouse. You [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2249.16s)]
*  don't have to get into it. If it's anyway, please don't. The [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2252.8799999999997s)]
*  point is, he had a video where he talks about like how they get [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2255.48s)]
*  internet, where they go to the Egyptian border and have eSIMs. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2260.2400000000002s)]

*  their own way. Yeah, Israel controls like the [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2282.4s)]
*  telecommunications as well. Like they would routinely blow up. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2284.68s)]
*  He thinks they can because he watches you right now. He didn't [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2288.56s)]

*  Here's the thing. Do you notice something weird about this [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2611.8599999999997s)]
*  article headline? When you see this headline, doesn't it kind of [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2614.66s)]
*  make you feel like the gunfire could be coming from anyone? [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2617.7s)]

*  America, and also in the Western world in general, will apply [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2628.3399999999997s)]
*  this technique called passive voice. You would never like [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2632.14s)]

*  with World Trade Center causes 3000 to perish. They wouldn't [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2641.22s)]
*  say that right attacked the World Trade Center is the [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2648.02s)]
*  headline. Right. And it is a way to make it seem like whenever [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2651.5s)]
*  a cop someone in America, or whenever Israel or an American [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2657.1s)]

*  yep, the way that like Western media tries to, you know, put a [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2665.86s)]
*  you know, manicure the story and manufacture consent by [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2672.18s)]

*  consent. Like you're reading this and you're like, Oh, it [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2684.34s)]
*  could be anybody. I guess like Israel might not have done it. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2688.02s)]
*  It's a it's a way to yeah, take the edge off. Basically, they [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2692.7s)]
*  do this all the time. But why? Why not just be like what? Why [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2695.18s)]
*  and send in this circumstances approval, like you give tacit [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2699.22s)]
*  endorsement, who owns the Guardian? British, some rich [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2702.1s)]

*  reason why Western newspapers soften these sorts of actions is [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2708.78s)]
*  because it's not because it's like owned by a singular [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2715.0600000000004s)]
*  individual. It's because the goal of these institutions is to [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2717.82s)]
*  do propaganda that align with the interests of their own state. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2724.46s)]
*  That's why they do it. It's not like an individual that is [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2729.02s)]
*  engaging in propaganda because they're like are personally [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2732.1000000000004s)]
*  invested in Israel in some instances, they might be like [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2735.34s)]
*  literally invested in Israel and like their portfolio has [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2737.9s)]
*  investments in Israel, right? Like that's one aspect of the [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2744.5s)]
*  story. But like, usually, usually they do this specifically [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2747.62s)]
*  to to make it seem like Israel's actions are not even the LA [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2752.7400000000002s)]
*  Times actually said UCLA cancels classes after counter [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2756.62s)]
*  protesters attack pro Palestinian camp. This was [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2760.34s)]

*  mainstream media being like, yeah, listen up, big dog, you [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2773.38s)]
*  guys up a little bit dismantled pro Palestinian camp. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2775.98s)]

*  No, dude, are you serious? After protests at UCLA, UC [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2782.54s)]
*  president launches investigation into response. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2786.86s)]
*  Why they change it. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2789.02s)]
*  They changed it because it was too anti Israel. In real time, we [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2790.34s)]
*  watched it happen. They were like, all right, well, you know, [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2793.62s)]
*  maybe the first headline wasn't great. We should they [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2796.2999999999997s)]
*  definitely look look look gunfire wounds dozens in [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2799.66s)]

*  I got a question. So when you see an article like this, what [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2830.7799999999997s)]
*  you probably do is look into it more to see what actually [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2834.1s)]
*  happened, right? Is that how it works? Yeah, because the average [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2836.46s)]
*  person will see his article move on with their day. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2838.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. And that's the informed person. The average person [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2840.7s)]
*  doesn't know or give a fuck about any of this. But the [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2842.94s)]
*  informed population that want to learn about it, read these [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2845.02s)]
*  articles and will you know, their takeaway will be whatever [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2848.46s)]
*  the article wants you to think. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2851.7s)]
*  Like an LSF thread. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2853.1s)]
*  I don't know why you would compare it to LSF in that regard. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2854.1s)]
*  But I guess it's correct. People read the titles and just assume [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2856.62s)]
*  that's what happened. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2859.82s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. That's not that's not wrong. And holy man, [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2860.46s)]

*  know what's going on. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2865.66s)]
*  Yeah, it's not easy. It's not easy. And that's why I also [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2866.42s)]

*  active. And that's precisely what it did. It caused [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2976.26s)]
*  psychological trauma to the civilian population that was [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2978.86s)]

*  it was actually a phenomenal tactical instance of Israeli [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2992.06s)]
*  espionage. And a lot of people don't actually scratch the [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=2997.06s)]
*  surface. They just look at that. And they go, yeah, you know [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=3000.26s)]

*  because like if you interrogate that person and try to figure [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=3461.98s)]

*  Well you weren't here this morning when I talked about it [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=3479.94s)]

*  health care that is fully aware of the fully aware of the hurt [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp61NU4dJVY&t=3485.66s)]
