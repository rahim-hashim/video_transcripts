# Will Pete Hegseth Be Confirmed As Defense Secretary? | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM)
*  Um, because when, when you have, when you have the Republican leadership in the Senate [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=0.0s)]
*  on board is over, you can have like a couple fake holdouts, but it doesn't matter. And [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=6.72s)]
*  I'm fairly certain that if Mitch McConnell had a consequential vote, if Mitch McConnell [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=13.8s)]
*  had a consequential vote, he would have, he would have still voted over the absolute. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=19.56s)]
*  Should I go out chat or is there new Lord Robin about the Trump admin? Well, sec, our [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=24.48s)]
*  new secretary defense is being confirmed right now on the Senate floor with 38 nos and 40 [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=33.52s)]
*  yeses so far. He's slated to become the first ever DUI candidate. That's not true. Actually [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  every, every policy from the state of Florida is a DUI candidate. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=48.2s)]
*  But in the, in the meantime, I am waiting for, I am waiting for a March and will to [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=51.32s)]
*  get here and then we're going to mobilize and we are going to move out and we're going [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=58.88s)]
*  to go to a, a cool little restaurant where we fish our own fish. I'm probably not going [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=64.28s)]
*  to eat, but I will be engaging the fishing part of it at least, even though I'm grossed [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=73.44s)]
*  out by fish in general, the smell of it, the taste of it and everything, but it'll be a [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=78.36s)]
*  fun little expedition. I think you forgot to show the drawings. No, I didn't hold on. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=83.4s)]
*  I'm going to grab it right now. Pete Hague, Seth, what's your reaction to the vote today? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=89.04s)]
*  Sean, I'm telling you, Pete set the bar high for candidates on how you go and win votes. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=94.16s)]
*  He is working all the way up to literally the last hour. I was with him just a second [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=99.84s)]
*  ago. He was still on the phone. You're right. Him and Tillis did have a good meeting today. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=104.55999999999999s)]
*  And I'm telling you, Pete and Jenny, they're a power couple. The way they, the way they attacked [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=110.63999999999999s)]
*  the media, the way that the media came after them and they just faced it front on, they took the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  shots over the head and they never, they never blinked. They never stepped back. They just [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  continued moving forward. Pete earned this vote today because of the, his, his ability to go into [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=124.56s)]
*  the fire and win the fight. I have been so impressed by him through this process. I get [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=132.32s)]
*  to call him a friend like you. Yeah. This just was X'd out. It was put on X by Senator Tom Tillis. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=137.76s)]
*  From the beginning, I have been clear about my position. If president Trump's nominees [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=146.4s)]
*  were reported favorably out of the relevant committees, I would support their confirmation [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  on the Senate floor, absent new material information on their qualifications. Once, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=156.96s)]
*  once Pete Hegstest nomination was sent to the floor by my colleagues on the Senate Armed [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=162.64s)]
*  Services Committee, I conducted my own due diligence, including asking tough questions [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=167.76s)]
*  of Pete. I appreciated his candor and openness in answering them. He has a unique perspective [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=172.64s)]
*  as a veteran of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and is unquestionably passionate about modernizing our [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=178.88s)]
*  military and supporting the brave patriots like myself who serve our nation. I will support his [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=186.16s)]
*  confirmation. Look forward to working with him to rebuild our military and advance Donald Trump's [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=191.44s)]
*  peace through strength agenda. Turn this boring shit off. To any Senator, you know, taking advising [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=197.04s)]
*  consent as a serious matter. Graduated from having that shit on university as always. You already know with the masters. Every elected official should do. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=206.24s)]
*  And some people, you know, get angry. Extra questions or want more information. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=213.04s)]
*  To me, they're doing their job. Sean, what Tom is is very thorough. We're gonna go fish. His word is [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=219.2s)]
*  gold. If he tells you where he's at, he's gonna tell you. He's not gonna pull back punches. What he appreciated about Pete was exactly what President Trump appreciated about him too. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=226.23999999999998s)]
*  And then when they go to Harajuku and make them find maid outfits that they can wear when they work at the maid cafe. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=236.32s)]
*  He's not afraid of the fight and he's not afraid of taking on tough issues. Pete sat there and would take the questions and he didn't dodge them. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=241.28s)]
*  He didn't hide from them. He addressed every single one of them and that's why he was able to win the votes over. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=247.2s)]
*  Now we knew we were walking into a situation where we may lose three people and we started there. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=252.48s)]
*  We started there thinking that we're gonna have to have 50-50 on this vote and then Senator J.D. Vance is going to be able to cast the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=259.03999999999996s)]
*  the deciding vote on this one. That's exactly where we started and it was exactly where we ended up. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=265.84000000000003s)]
*  But we did it because Pete and Jenny walk the halls here daily and was willing to take those. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=271.04s)]
*  Oh my God, dude, shut up. Okay. Yeah, he's gonna, he's gonna get the nomination, but kicking March off. Yeah. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=277.12s)]
*  So here's what we're doing right now. We're waiting for William. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=289.76s)]
*  Spoiler. Tom tells us a yes on Hex it likely given the supporting ease of the confirmation. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=295.6s)]
*  It comes after Hex's sense. Tell us this letter. Nice. Get yields is not fishy. I'm not, I'm not going to do that. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=301.28000000000003s)]
*  I'm not going to have eels. Yeah. Our IRL portion is about to begin. It's late at the begin. It's probably freshwater fish. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=309.04s)]
*  So that's not seafood, maybe like food. Okay. Regardless, fish for your own meal restaurant. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=316.48s)]
*  This literally in metaphor, we fantasio nice. What was I going to say? Oh, first and foremost. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=322.08s)]
*  All right, let's get let's let's show this really quickly. Here is a jumbos. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=327.84s)]
*  Jumbos artwork that is beautiful. Look at this. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=334.71999999999997s)]
*  Amazing. Okay. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=343.84s)]
*  He made some mini prints too, like little cards as well. I will cherish this. Thank you. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=346.15999999999997s)]
*  Jumbo man draws. Thank you so much. You're a wonderful artist. Also. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=357.35999999999996s)]
*  What else was I going to say? Oh yeah. We are going to be working at a maid cafe in a couple days. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=367.2s)]
*  And in order to work at the main cafe, we have to get made outfits. And unfortunately, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=372.88s)]
*  uh, Kao actually warned me ahead of time that I and will even would have a very hard time finding [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=378.24s)]
*  made outfits in Japan and that we should have ordered ahead of time. But of course I didn't have time to order it ahead of time. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=386.08s)]
*  So we'll, we'll see. I'm going to try my very best to fit into it. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=391.84s)]
*  But, you know, it'll be fun. It'll be a fun process about to engage in mistreatment. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=396.56s)]
*  Do these fish get Trump thrown back in? Once you catch him sitting in a pool waiting to be caught over and over again until you finally die. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=404.24s)]
*  Okay. I don't care. This is what I say to the fish. It's fish, bro. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=409.44s)]
*  We, oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=418.48s)]
*  We, oh, we'll probably can almost, we'll get here. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=425.36s)]
*  Um, Mike's about to fall off. Woke of the day. Yeah. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=429.12s)]
*  Uh, I mean, we got, we always got a woke of the day. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=437.28000000000003s)]
*  The Fisher friend, not food. I mean, I don't eat fish. So honestly, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=444.8s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=455.20000000000005s)]
*  Wait, the Hex of both failed. Wait, how who spoiled it? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=461.92s)]
*  I expected that. But as you know, it's 50% plus one. It doesn't matter how you get there. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=469.36s)]
*  Pete's a change maker. President Trump deserves Pete and anyone else that he wants around him. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=475.28000000000003s)]
*  And I'll tell you what the delegation here in New Hampshire and all the Democrats who [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=480.8s)]
*  are being obstructionists. I mean, it's very, very quickly, very, very quickly. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=485.36s)]
*  Really shut up. They should be the voters failing immediately as they did for Joe Biden. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=490.72s)]
*  Who said no, where we basically said, okay, listen, you got the McConnell, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=495.52000000000004s)]
*  and I hope John keeps them there for every single day until this is done. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=502.8s)]
*  And I, yeah, go to Brian Bremberg, Brian. You've known people for a long time. You've been a very [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=507.52000000000004s)]
*  close friend of his. Now they got to go to Mrs. Concern that you know, love, care about, and know [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=514.96s)]
*  their true character. Now they have to either go back and farm miss Mrs. Concern, the concern duo, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=521.12s)]
*  or they have to farm John Fetterman. Turn out. I wish I was wrong. I said, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=526.88s)]
*  is probably starting out with no one Susan, no on Lisa, no one. I said, if you lose one more, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=532.88s)]
*  that means you're not going to get it. And by the way, it's a tie-breaking vote. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=538.72s)]
*  Wait, why'd you guys say he's a fail? McConnell's a no till it's a yes. That means Hexed is likely [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=543.92s)]
*  to be confirmed. The deciding vote. Let's listen in on the Senate floor, Brian, before we get to [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=547.76s)]
*  you. All right. Let's see. Extremely rare. Mitch McConnell, W shut up. Don't ever give him a W. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=551.36s)]
*  Oh, apparently there's nothing to listen to. So let's go back to Brian. Go ahead, Brian. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=556.08s)]
*  Look, Sean, this is, this is amazing. Pete has been a friend of mine for almost four decades. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=562.08s)]
*  Okay. I knew the kids second grade trading baseball cards. I've been a colleague at Fox with him. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=568.08s)]
*  And this has been a tough process to go through, obviously, but Senator Mullen got it exactly [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=574.24s)]
*  right. And it's actually been the greatest part of the process. Pete outworked everybody. He [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=580.48s)]
*  outworked his detractors. He outworked the people who were like sidelines. They're so annoying, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=586.8s)]
*  bro. Anybody who wanted to come at him about his character or his ability to lead. And he said, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=592.24s)]
*  I'll talk to you. Let me make my McConnell. McConnell is a institutional Republican. He cares [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=597.68s)]
*  about the Republican party more than anything else. And that is part of the reason why he [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=603.52s)]
*  despised Donald Trump. It was not fake. It was not phony. Like he genuinely, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=608.24s)]
*  he liked Donald Trump for his agenda, but he also always saw Donald Trump as a threat to the future [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=612.88s)]
*  of the Republican party. So it's a, it's probably one last fuck you before he dies. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=618.5600000000001s)]
*  And I knew when he did that, the American people would have more confidence in him. And so I love [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=623.28s)]
*  actually, though, I don't wish it on anybody in their personal life. I love that Pete went through [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=629.44s)]
*  the process exactly. And ultimately his vote doesn't matter. I yeah. Cause JD Vance [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=634.64s)]
*  going to cast high breaker vote. Obviously for those who serve in our military, I'm happy for [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=642.16s)]
*  America that he will now have the chance to do what he said he will do to make our military [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=646.56s)]
*  prepared, ready to be lethal and focused on its mission and not anything else that the political [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=652.7199999999999s)]
*  class has tried to make it for the past. This is more consequential. Tell us. Okay. They, they [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=659.36s)]
*  locked down. They already had locked down the institutional Republicans because, because when, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=669.2s)]
*  when you have, when you have the Republican leadership in the Senate on board is over, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=678.6400000000001s)]
*  you can have like a couple fake holdouts, but it doesn't matter. And I'm fairly certain that [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=683.9200000000001s)]
*  if Mitch McConnell had a consequential vote, if Mitch McConnell had a consequential vote, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=690.5600000000001s)]
*  he would have, he would have still voted over the absolute coals to get it here. Second, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=696.5600000000001s)]
*  this is why your Senate vote is so important. Hey, how about Pennsylvania? Dave McCormick [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=702.64s)]
*  wins in Pennsylvania by what? 15,000 votes or so. That's the difference between Pete Hegseth [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=709.36s)]
*  getting across the finish line or not three huge win for Donald Trump and everybody else in line [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=716.0s)]
*  here. Because if you knock one guy or gal, Mitch McConnell has come out and said that the sole [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=723.12s)]
*  reason he refuses to have down is because he made it his personal dying mission. You're sure Trump [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=728.4s)]
*  can't stop Ukraine military aid. Yeah. These guys are, I mean, they, they, they operate on a, on a [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=732.24s)]
*  different way, dude. They, they operate in a totally separate playing field. It's like, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=741.68s)]
*  they are, they're ideology demons. Okay. Ryan, Ruth 2.0. Yeah. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=746.88s)]
*  They're, I totally, I get it. Listen, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=756.72s)]
*  talking like he's narrating sports. I mean, yeah, you do realize Pete Hegseth is a commentator [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=764.24s)]
*  for this platform. So all of the people that they have on right now on this platform are [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=770.88s)]
*  his former coworkers, or I guess even technically his current coworkers. So, you know, they're [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=776.4s)]
*  going to glaze them up special sexual style. Does we'll know you're here. Okay. Wait, hold on. He [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=783.36s)]
*  probably doesn't know. Okay. Hold on. Hold on. He's always working with me. I know [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=792.56s)]
*  I know. We appreciate it. Let's go back to our own Chad program. Who's with us on Capitol Hill. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=806.4s)]
*  Well, we got to the magic number 50. I thought Mitch would be a no. I thought that Tillis would [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=812.4s)]
*  be yes. And it turned out that way. And now JD Vance will cast the deciding vote. Well, it looks [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=818.4s)]
*  like we're going to have a 51 50 vote. We call this year on Capitol Hill, a Van Halen vote, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=826.88s)]
*  because that's that album they had some years ago. 51 50. Again, Vice President Vance has just been [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=832.4s)]
*  in office a couple of days and this will be his first tie breaking vote. It doesn't happen very [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=839.36s)]
*  much depending on the arrangement of the Senate and the arrangement of the issues before them [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=844.8s)]
*  and whether or not a vice president has to break a tie. So he's getting to do this very early on. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=849.04s)]
*  We saw this during the Trump administration the first time where vice president Pence had to come [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=853.84s)]
*  to Capitol Hill to break a number of ties on both issues and even some lower level figures. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=858.4s)]
*  But I mentioned earlier, veteran secretary, what you're looking at right now on the floor, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=863.36s)]
*  Mike rounds Republican center from South Dakota, leaning back in that chair all the way over to [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=867.68s)]
*  the right there. That's the dais and that's Mike rounds. At some point, JD Vance will come in [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=873.6s)]
*  and preside over the Senate in his capacity as president of the Senate. In the old days, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=879.12s)]
*  we used to see the vice president, you know, pretty much preside all the time. That doesn't [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=884.08s)]
*  happen much anymore except for big occasions or certainly when they think they need to have a tie [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=888.8000000000001s)]
*  breaking vote, but he will announce the yeas. Yeah. I wonder why they think the album was named [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=892.96s)]
*  51 50. It's a funny thing to say about Congress. I agree. They should be 51 50. It means involuntary [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=897.36s)]
*  involuntary hold. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=907.2800000000001s)]
*  The album's named after California police term for mentally unstable person, which comes from [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=914.1600000000001s)]
*  section 51 50 at the California welfare institution's code. 51 50 is also the name of the Eddie Van [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=917.36s)]
*  Allen's home studio where the band worked on the record. Yeah. It's an involuntary psych [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=925.2s)]
*  holding California chapter and verse through this affidavit that, you know, dealt with some, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=929.36s)]
*  have you all seen the cute winter boots stuff on tick tock? No, what are you talking about? I have [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=935.0400000000001s)]
*  heard some people in the chat reference it and I have no clue what that is. What is it? Someone link me. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94uQYzUfYvM&t=938.64s)]
