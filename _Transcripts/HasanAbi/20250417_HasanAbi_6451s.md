**HasanAbi:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ)
*  He's just like, oh, but we've been invaded by so many, uh, so many migrants. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=0.0s)]
*  My parents built this country. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=7.44s)]
*  How can you expect us to go through due process with 20 million people? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  And it's like, dude, shut the up. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=16.56s)]
*  Just say it with your goddamn chest. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=19.52s)]
*  You I hate you so much. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=21.76s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=25.44s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=27.6s)]
*  It's like so stupid. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=29.12s)]
*  What? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=32.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=37.2s)]
*  Let's watch something fun. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=37.52s)]
*  One night with Stiney. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=39.92s)]
*  I did the podcast with Stiney and I think it was good. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=43.52s)]
*  Saturday is the best day of the year. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=47.28s)]
*  If I don't know, you're, you're one for the drama. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=50.0s)]
*  I am unfamiliar with the drama that you guys were getting into. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=52.16s)]
*  He's one of the NELC boys. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=56.08s)]
*  He is. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=57.68000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=58.24s)]
*  But you're one that's always in drama. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=58.64s)]
*  Yeah, I am. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=61.6s)]
*  I don't try to be. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  I mean, I talk about politics for the most part, but drama always seems to find its way. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=64.32s)]
*  I don't like it either. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=71.36s)]
*  I don't know how you guys, I was actually, you're, uh, I don't know if he's your arch [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=72.48s)]
*  nemesis or your opera, but H3H3, uh, you guys go at it daily. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=76.4s)]
*  He's not. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=82.0s)]
*  Maybe he goes at you. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=82.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=83.28s)]
*  He, I think, I think is a little bit slanted in the, in the opposite direction where [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=83.92s)]
*  I think he goes after me quite a bit. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=87.84s)]
*  Um, I, I don't have any ill intent towards them. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  Like I wish him well. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=94.56s)]
*  I hope he's doing all right. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  Um, it is what it is. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=97.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  And you, I don't, I don't even know this, but you guys said you had a podcast. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=100.80000000000001s)]
*  We did. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=103.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  We had a podcast called leftovers. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=104.4s)]
*  It's like, well, it ended right after October 7. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=105.84s)]
*  It ended like a month after October 7 basically, but we had a podcast where we would talk [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=109.28s)]
*  about politics, uh, called leftovers. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=113.92s)]
*  And why? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=117.04s)]
*  We did that for like two years. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=117.36s)]
*  I think it probably did pretty well, right? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=118.56s)]
*  It did pretty well. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=120.16s)]

*  Damn. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=122.16s)]
*  Uh, you've talked about us before, right? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  The note, of course, the elk boy. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=125.84s)]
*  I can't imagine how positive. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=127.76s)]
*  Oh, definitely not very positive. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=129.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=130.8s)]
*  Tell me refresh my memory, please. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=131.44s)]
*  Um, I think what have, I mean, there's, I've probably said a million things. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=133.28s)]
*  I mean, I love Bradley for the record. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=138.48s)]
*  Uh, Bradley Martin. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=141.2s)]

*  That happens. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=167.20000000000002s)]
*  No, I mean, you know, the market's going to correct itself. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=169.28s)]
*  Like, that'll all come back. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=171.20000000000002s)]

*  Really? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=187.2s)]
*  I don't crypto at all. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=187.68s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  I'm looking for a crypto guy. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=189.76s)]
*  No, like every streamer has a lot of crypto. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=191.28s)]
*  No, that's because every streamer you know, does deal with the crypto casino, a stake. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=193.68s)]
*  That's why they all have crypto. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=200.32s)]
*  Got it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=202.16s)]
*  I don't do that either. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=202.56s)]
*  Is that just, I do gamble. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=204.0s)]
*  I mean, I like gambling. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=205.68s)]
*  I don't have an issue with it. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=206.88s)]
*  Just when you're in Vegas? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I just don't like, I don't like promoting it for the most part. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=209.2s)]
*  And I'm sure have you been offered big deals before? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=212.64s)]
*  Um, I'm, not directly through stake. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=215.12s)]
*  I mean, I've been offered crazy deals. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=219.04s)]
*  I was offered like half a million for a poker tournament one time and turn that down. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=222.24s)]
*  For one tournament? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=226.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=227.36s)]
*  Just play? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=227.68s)]
*  Yeah, I was offered. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=228.48s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=229.52s)]
*  Whoa, whoa, whoa. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=230.0s)]
*  How do you turn that down? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=230.88s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=232.16s)]
*  I don't, I don't, I don't gamble like that. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=232.72s)]
*  But to play half a million for free? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=235.6s)]
*  Yeah, to play poker too. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=237.52s)]
*  But I also don't know how to play poker. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=238.64s)]
*  That's another thing. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=240.16s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=240.96s)]
*  Even then. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=241.2s)]
*  That's why you like Brad, I feel like. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=241.52s)]
*  Because you guys got that like ego thing where it's like, you don't want to, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=242.72s)]
*  you'd rather save the 500k and not risk embarrassing yourself in poker. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=245.2s)]
*  Oh no, I embarrass myself all the time. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=249.04s)]
*  I don't give a shit about that. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=250.72s)]
*  I, no, I just, I don't, I was thinking about it ethically where I just don't like [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=252.96s)]
*  the promotion of gambling in general. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=258.88s)]
*  I think it should be like heavily regulated. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=260.64s)]
*  But even then I just thought that that's not for me. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=263.12s)]
*  There was a crypto. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=266.64s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=267.92s)]
*  Remember that like online. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=269.59999999999997s)]
*  His main producer is also a massive Hassan Abihed by the way, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=271.92s)]
*  which kind of shocked me to my core. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=276.88s)]
*  I forgot to mention that like he was stoked. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=279.28s)]
*  It was like, dude, I've been watching you for years. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=282.88s)]
*  I'm a huge fan. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=284.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=287.2s)]
*  Jewish Hassan Abihed's rise up. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=287.68s)]

*  It's not just about Trump. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=358.32s)]
*  I think it's more so about the presentation of a lifestyle that I feel like revolves around a lot of [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=359.67999999999995s)]

*  But for me, I feel like the political signifiers associated with that doesn't have to be like, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=407.04s)]
*  I don't know, trans people, marginalized identities, things of that nature. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=414.32s)]

*  Sure. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=433.92s)]
*  I understand that. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=434.16s)]

*  The whole site was down except for a VTuber, it seems. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=494.08s)]
*  Special event. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=496.32s)]
*  I didn't even see that. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=497.28000000000003s)]
*  Hey, it might. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=499.2s)]
*  It might. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=500.08s)]
*  It's just, I'm not even, I'm not even saying it won't. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=500.8s)]
*  I don't really care about the stock market in terms of, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=503.92s)]
*  uh, like I don't think the stock market is a, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=506.40000000000003s)]
*  is a healthy assessment of the economy. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=508.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=510.0s)]
*  Um, but you know, a lot of the stuff that he's doing beyond the stock market is, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=510.64s)]
*  is pretty bad. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=516.32s)]
*  Okay, so let me ask you something. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=516.8s)]
*  How long you lived in LA for? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=517.92s)]
*  10 plus years at this point, like 12 years. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=519.4399999999999s)]
*  Okay, so my biggest issue, and I think what has made me, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=522.48s)]
*  pushed me more to the conservative side is after living here, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=525.76s)]
*  state income taxes crazy. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=529.36s)]
*  Mm hmm. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=530.88s)]
*  The, it's very leftist, like, especially with Biden and president, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=531.68s)]
*  it was almost like the woke mindset was pushed heavily. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=535.68s)]
*  And what do you mean by that? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=539.36s)]
*  It just seemed like there was too much like that didn't, wasn't necessary. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=541.4399999999999s)]
*  Like what? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=544.88s)]
*  Like the, just like the LGBTQ was just very pushed upon you. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=546.3199999999999s)]
*  And it was like almost disingenuous. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=551.1999999999999s)]
*  Well, first of all, let me just start off by saying I'm not a Brandon supporter. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=554.9599999999999s)]
*  I would not consider Gavin Newsom to be a leftist either. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=560.56s)]
*  He's actually talked about how he's starting to go more towards the middle. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=564.4799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, all those guys do. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=567.04s)]
*  You have to now. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=568.56s)]
*  I don't think you have to as a, as a matter of fact, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=570.0s)]
*  I think they should actually go to the left instead of, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=572.3199999999999s)]
*  uh, instead of aesthetically presenting themselves as like woke people and then [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=575.4399999999999s)]
*  drop all of that and look like hypocrites. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=581.3599999999999s)]
*  That was one of my big criticisms of Kamala Harris and also Biden too, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=583.92s)]
*  which was this idea that they were, they called Trump racist [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=587.68s)]
*  and Trump supporters racist for the border wall. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=592.16s)]
*  And then by the time the election came around, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=594.7199999999999s)]
*  they were like, actually, we want to build the border wall. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=596.7199999999999s)]
*  I was like, the are you doing? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=598.7199999999999s)]
*  Of course. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=599.76s)]
*  You look like a goddamn hypocrite. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=600.24s)]
*  That's because it became a huge problem. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=601.68s)]
*  But the reason why it became a huge problem wasn't necessarily [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=603.6s)]
*  because it actually was a huge problem. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=607.28s)]
*  It was because it was dominating the media landscape. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=609.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=611.6s)]
*  So I think you'll agree with me on the assessment that like the media, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=612.16s)]
*  oftentimes mainstream news will lie to you [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=617.12s)]
*  and has the capacity to change people's perception. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=619.52s)]
*  Right? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=622.16s)]
*  Of course. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=622.48s)]
*  Yeah. And I think that on the issue of immigration, on the issue of crime, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=623.12s)]
*  the media greatly overemphasized this narrative that undocumented [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=627.84s)]
*  migrants were doing crimes left and right. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=631.92s)]
*  When in fact, when you look at the actual data itself, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=634.64s)]
*  they are doing less crime per capita than natural born US citizens are, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=638.0s)]
*  like significantly less. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=643.5999999999999s)]
*  Trump would go on the campaign trail and would say, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=645.1999999999999s)]
*  undocumented migrants are doing a hundred thousand murders a year. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=648.3199999999999s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of people are being killed. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=651.76s)]
*  Right? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=653.68s)]
*  You look at the actual data, how many, how many undocumented, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=654.8s)]
*  like non-citizen documented and undocumented, as a matter of fact, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=659.28s)]
*  murders and murder convictions took place in the fiscal year of 2024. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=663.04s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=667.28s)]
*  If I were to ask you, but like Trump is saying hundreds of thousands, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=668.0799999999999s)]
*  give me a ballpark. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=670.56s)]
*  How many murders are happening in the US? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=671.28s)]
*  How many? Yeah. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=673.8399999999999s)]
*  How many, how many convictions has taken place for a non-citizen, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=674.4799999999999s)]
*  both documented and undocumented in the fiscal year of 2024? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=678.8s)]
*  Convictions. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=682.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=682.9599999999999s)]
*  Well, that makes it way more difficult. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=684.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=686.3199999999999s)]
*  20,000. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=688.56s)]
*  I think the last time I checked it was 24, not 24,000, 24. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=692.3199999999999s)]
*  There's, that's, there's no way. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=696.8s)]
*  How, yeah. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=698.0799999999999s)]
*  I think that that doesn't matter though. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=700.0s)]
*  Wait, what do you mean? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=701.68s)]
*  Bro, there's a lot of murders that happen in places like Detroit, Chicago, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=702.8s)]
*  that go, you get away with murder. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=707.1199999999999s)]
*  I think you think there's a lot of unsolved murders [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=708.88s)]
*  that the undocumented migrants are doing. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=711.8399999999999s)]
*  Not, no, I thought you were talking about documented too. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=713.5999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and documented as well. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=715.76s)]
*  You're trying to say in a whole year, there's only 24 murders. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=717.12s)]
*  24 murder convictions in the fiscal year. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=719.68s)]
*  Yeah. Murder for in the fiscal year of 2024. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=722.5600000000001s)]
*  See, I don't know, bro. I'll go on X. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=725.84s)]
*  You ever go on X late at night and see like the dark side of X? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=727.28s)]
*  I feel like all sides. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=732.32s)]
*  I've seen six, six guys dying in one drive-by. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=733.44s)]
*  I swear. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=739.28s)]
*  That's like what I've seen. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=739.68s)]
*  Undocumented. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=740.48s)]
*  Huh? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=741.52s)]
*  How do you know they're undocumented? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=741.84s)]
*  It seems like they get away within the video. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=742.96s)]
*  That's, well, okay. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=744.72s)]
*  I'll send you the link and then you tell me. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=746.32s)]
*  But you don't know they're undocumented. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=747.7600000000001s)]
*  I'm watching at night. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=749.2800000000001s)]
*  You don't know they're undocumented. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=750.24s)]
*  You don't know if they actually get caught later in the law. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=751.5200000000001s)]
*  24 size. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=753.6800000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of unsolved murders. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=755.36s)]
*  My point was there's a lot of solved murders as well, right? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=756.8000000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of charges for murder and convictions for murder. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=759.6800000000001s)]
*  And you got to adjust. You got to look at the disparity. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=762.6400000000001s)]
*  You have to look at what percentage of the convicted murders [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=765.12s)]
*  were documented U.S. citizens versus undocumented [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=768.6400000000001s)]
*  and then extrapolate from that data. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=771.2800000000001s)]
*  Okay, OJ. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=773.7600000000001s)]
*  There's no. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=774.4000000000001s)]
*  OJ not convicted. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=774.8800000000001s)]
*  So that would make it 25. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=776.5600000000001s)]
*  So there's one, right? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=778.4000000000001s)]
*  Well, OJ is documented citizen. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=780.4000000000001s)]
*  But he's not convicted. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=782.88s)]
*  That's true. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=784.1600000000001s)]
*  So there's 25. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=784.8000000000001s)]
*  Well, he's also very, very wealthy, you know? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=785.6s)]
*  So I think being wealthy and being a celebrity [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=789.5200000000001s)]
*  probably helps in that regard when you want to. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=792.5600000000001s)]
*  I think the timing of that helped it. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=794.32s)]
*  The timing of that definitely played a role too. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=795.9200000000001s)]
*  It became a political issue as well. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=797.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=799.6s)]
*  But overall, what I'm trying to say is the idea, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=800.08s)]
*  the disparity between what Trump is saying about [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=804.56s)]
*  undocumented migrants versus what the reality is. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=807.1999999999999s)]
*  Why did you talk to this guy? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=809.28s)]
*  Because he has an audience. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=810.16s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=811.3599999999999s)]
*  His audience are the people that need to hear this [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=812.9599999999999s)]
*  more than you, dumbass. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=816.4799999999999s)]
*  What the f— [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=819.1999999999999s)]
*  What kind of question is this, dude? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=819.92s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=821.92s)]
*  I talk to him because you have no way of talking to him [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=823.1199999999999s)]
*  or his fans. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=827.1999999999999s)]
*  I do. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=829.3599999999999s)]
*  That's why I do this. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=830.16s)]
*  This is crazy. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=831.5999999999999s)]
*  They do crimes and there's, of course, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=832.64s)]
*  everybody has the capability of doing crime, right? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=834.88s)]
*  They're not like a hive mind. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=837.36s)]
*  They're not a monolith. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=839.36s)]
*  You got from Guatemala at the age of like 35 coming in [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=840.4s)]
*  and you got dudes from China coming in as well. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=845.12s)]
*  Sure. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=849.28s)]
*  Totally different demographics. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=849.78s)]
*  They're not all collectively like a hive mind, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=851.04s)]
*  even though we try to make it seem as though [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=853.36s)]
*  they're all operating on the same ideals [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=855.52s)]
*  where they're coming into America to be like, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=858.16s)]
*  I'm going to do crimes. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=859.68s)]
*  I can't wait to do murder. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=860.88s)]
*  So where do you get all your information from? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=861.6s)]
*  Because you're clearly passionate and educated on this, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=863.28s)]
*  but where do you get— [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=865.04s)]
*  Everywhere. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=866.0s)]
*  You got to get your information from somewhere, right? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=866.64s)]
*  Everywhere. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=868.56s)]
*  I look at it over the course of my stream. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=869.76s)]
*  I stream on Twitch for 8 to 10 hours every single day, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=873.04s)]
*  seven days a week. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=875.52s)]
*  Seven days a week? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=876.24s)]
*  Yeah, seven days a week. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=877.6s)]
*  Holy— [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=878.96s)]
*  Over the course of my broadcast, I will look at every outlet. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=879.4399999999999s)]
*  I probably watch more Fox News and right-wing outlets [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=882.88s)]
*  than I do liberal ones. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=885.04s)]
*  You got to watch Fox. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=886.64s)]
*  Fox News is better than CNN. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=887.4399999999999s)]
*  I mean, better how? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=889.1999999999999s)]
*  More entertaining. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=890.8s)]
*  More entertaining, bad-looking women. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=891.5999999999999s)]
*  I don't really care. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=894.56s)]
*  You don't care. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=895.92s)]
*  But I'm just saying— [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=896.24s)]
*  I don't pay attention to that because I'm not going to [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=896.9599999999999s)]
*  fuck more anger either. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=898.64s)]
*  No, but it's a smart marketing tactic that they will do. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=899.76s)]
*  I guess, if you say so. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=903.1999999999999s)]
*  I don't want to fuck my newscasters. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=905.1999999999999s)]
*  I want them to tell me the truth. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=906.64s)]
*  Yeah, well, you know what I'm talking about. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=908.7199999999999s)]
*  But if—and I know you know what I'm talking about, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=909.92s)]
*  but every single day are you only talking politics [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=912.16s)]
*  or do you talk about other stuff? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=914.4s)]
*  I talk about other stuff too. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=915.68s)]
*  I usually do the first four to five hours [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=917.1999999999999s)]
*  is like heavy politics. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=920.4s)]
*  And then after that, I move on to other stuff [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=921.6s)]
*  like culture stuff. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=923.04s)]
*  I play video games. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=923.84s)]
*  I do all of it. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=925.1999999999999s)]
*  Are you involved or do you do anything with any other streamers? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=926.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=929.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=930.48s)]
*  Yeah, I collaborate with streamers. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=930.9599999999999s)]
*  I know because I saw you've had beefs with streamers before, right? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=932.16s)]
*  I have had beefs with streamers. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=935.76s)]
*  I think Aiden and Neon or maybe I'm wrong. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=937.04s)]
*  Well, the Neon one, I think, was more so like a one side of beef on his end. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=939.76s)]
*  I didn't really have beef with them. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=943.68s)]
*  I didn't know because I only found out when he came up [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=945.52s)]
*  and apologized to me at the basketball thing. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=947.92s)]
*  Yeah, he was like, I'm so sorry that I came after you pretty hard. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=952.0s)]
*  I was talking to you. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=955.92s)]
*  He's like, you're Muslim. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=957.12s)]
*  I'm Muslim. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=958.0s)]
*  I was like, I didn't. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=958.4799999999999s)]
*  I don't. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=959.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=959.8399999999999s)]
*  But with Aiden, the Aiden one is crazy because I was pretty friendly with Aiden [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=960.8s)]
*  before the Andrew Tay stuff. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=968.4799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=970.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=971.04s)]
*  So that's what happened. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=971.28s)]
*  I think that's what started the spiral, I would say. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=973.1999999999999s)]
*  I was trying to help him out. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=976.24s)]
*  I was like, listen, don't do this. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=977.36s)]
*  Don't do that. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=979.12s)]
*  Do this instead. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=980.24s)]
*  So you were telling him, don't collab with Tate at all? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=981.04s)]
*  No, I was trying to guide him down a more reasonable path [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=983.52s)]
*  because I always look to people like Kai and look to people like Speed as great examples of [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=987.76s)]
*  how to manage your media career and do what you want to do, still have fun, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=994.4s)]
*  be as honest as you want to be, but don't become like a toxic brand or a toxic person in general. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1000.16s)]
*  And this was, of course, we're talking Aiden before Andrew Tay. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1008.0s)]
*  So I don't know how many years ago this is. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1013.12s)]
*  Probably three or four years ago. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1014.72s)]
*  Yeah, three or four years ago. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1015.84s)]
*  Like I would talk to him all the time. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1016.8000000000001s)]
*  We've like we've collabed together before and I tried to tell him like, don't do this. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1018.08s)]
*  Don't lean into this like right wing. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1024.24s)]
*  It's not going to be good. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1026.24s)]
*  It's not going to be good for your brand. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1027.44s)]
*  It's not going to be good for your mental space. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1028.96s)]
*  It's just going to be bad for you overall. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1032.88s)]
*  And he just went fully off the deep end on that front. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1034.8s)]
*  I mean, the smelling Andrew Tay seat. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1038.56s)]
*  I never, the dude that's smelling the seat is such low hanging fruit. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1042.3999999999999s)]
*  Anytime someone does that, I'm like, bro, come on. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1045.36s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1047.12s)]
*  He was memeing. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1047.84s)]
*  But yeah, but I will say it does seem like things didn't go so bad for him. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1048.72s)]
*  I feel like Aiden's doing really well right now. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1052.8799999999999s)]
*  I guess. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1055.2s)]
*  He did. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1055.68s)]
*  He got a, he did. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1056.24s)]
*  You could say whatever you want, whether you like Trump or not. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1057.52s)]
*  Doing a stream with the future president of the United States is pretty impressive. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1059.44s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1064.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, I, a lot of my friends have interviewed Trump. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1065.9199999999998s)]
*  And the majority of people in the country supported him. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1069.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1072.0s)]
*  I mean, I still despise the guy. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1072.32s)]
*  I don't even like Kamala Harris too. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1074.08s)]
*  So to be fair, but I mean, he is zesty. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1075.84s)]
*  He's very telegenic. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1080.32s)]
*  I will say that. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1081.52s)]
*  What do you think about that? [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1082.6399999999999s)]
*  He had that for him. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1083.44s)]
*  What? [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1084.32s)]
*  That's one W for Trump. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1085.68s)]
*  Is what he's zesty? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1087.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1088.6399999999999s)]
*  Trump is zesty. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1089.12s)]
*  You don't think he's zesty? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1090.0s)]
*  No, I haven't seen that. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1091.52s)]
*  More powder on his face than he just wants to look good. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1092.88s)]
*  What's wrong with looking good? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1096.0s)]
*  No, it's not in your hair right now. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1097.1200000000001s)]
*  I don't. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1099.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1100.16s)]
*  There's no way that's not. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1100.48s)]
*  No, I just have minoxidil. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1101.3600000000001s)]
*  I put a Rogaine. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1102.72s)]
*  Oh, so my hair. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1104.0800000000002s)]
*  Nice. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1105.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1106.0s)]
*  But it just, it looks like I got product. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1106.24s)]
*  But no, that's not the only reason why he's zesty. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1109.1200000000001s)]
*  He's a New York guy. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1111.7600000000002s)]
*  He loves Broadway. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1113.2800000000002s)]
*  You ever heard him talk about? [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1114.16s)]
*  He appreciates, he appreciates artwork and yeah, that's what I mean. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1116.0s)]
*  He's zesty. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1118.64s)]
*  You don't appreciate good acting. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1119.1200000000001s)]
*  No, I do too. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1120.5600000000002s)]
*  But I'm also zesty. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1121.6s)]

*  Okay. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1142.3999999999999s)]
*  I don't know what aromantic means. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1142.7199999999998s)]
*  He just doesn't know aromantic. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1145.04s)]
*  He doesn't have romantic relationships. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1146.7199999999998s)]

*  And he wants to get laid after. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1156.48s)]
*  Look at the way he walks around. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1158.32s)]
*  I mean, I like that aspect of Trump, by the way. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1159.6s)]
*  So you only like the zesty part about him. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1162.1599999999999s)]

*  I'm a normal person who knows how to have normal conversations with normal people [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1249.28s)]
*  without immediately turning the conversation into a back and forth political battle. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1254.48s)]
*  Like, why would I be weird to this guy? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1259.6s)]

*  I'm confident in my masculinity. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1294.0s)]
*  That's the difference. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1296.3999999999999s)]
*  I made myself dress up. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1298.08s)]
*  Damn bro. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1299.84s)]

*  Yeah, so I had that experience with him. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1592.72s)]

*  But he's way bigger than me. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1603.3600000000001s)]
*  He doesn't pick on people his own size. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1603.92s)]
*  He's way bigger than me, though. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1605.28s)]
*  I'm only- I mean, he's- [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1606.72s)]
*  Maybe, yeah, you guys might be close in the same height, but he's obviously stronger. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1609.04s)]
*  So, yeah, he's so much stronger than me. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1612.56s)]

*  He was just putting up- [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1625.8400000000001s)]
*  Like, it's nothing. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1627.28s)]
*  He was putting up like four plays, five plays on the deadlift. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1627.8400000000001s)]

*  Vivian. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1641.8400000000001s)]
*  Vivian, yeah. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1642.32s)]
*  How did that collab come about? [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1643.44s)]
*  That was the last thing I saw you do. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1645.28s)]
*  She was- [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1648.0s)]
*  Because she exposed Elon for not being this Diablo player, right? [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1650.16s)]
*  Yeah, but if you stole my look- [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1653.6000000000001s)]
*  I thought he was number one. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1655.28s)]
*  Shut up. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1656.56s)]
*  I thought he was number one, bro. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1657.04s)]
*  You did not think his ass was unironically, quote unquote, running eight companies or [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1657.6000000000001s)]
*  whatever and also constantly grinding in Diablo. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1664.4s)]
*  No, but that'd be gangster if he did. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1668.24s)]
*  No, there's not enough physical time in the day. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1670.0s)]
*  Yeah, okay, you're right. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1672.48s)]
*  And also, I don't even think he does too much for running the companies or whatever, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1673.36s)]
*  but he wants to be liked and everybody wants to be liked. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1677.76s)]
*  It's understandable, but he is to pay someone much better than him to play his characters- [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1683.28s)]
*  So that's what you think happened? [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1690.3999999999999s)]
*  That's what I- [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1692.4799999999998s)]
*  He's like he paid someone to play with his tag. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1693.4399999999998s)]
*  Oh, that is- you can get as much- [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1696.08s)]
*  First of all, you're looking at the glass half empty, bro. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1700.32s)]
*  That is the sickest job of all time. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1702.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1705.04s)]
*  You get paid by Elon to play Diablo as Elon. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1705.28s)]
*  So you're wrong there. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1708.1599999999999s)]
*  Maybe it is a facade, but I'm- [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1710.3999999999999s)]
*  To be fair, you've got to grind pretty hard. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1711.6s)]
*  You're literally playing the video game so much that you're most likely playing it at [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1713.52s)]
*  a professional level anyway that at that point is no longer fun. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1717.04s)]
*  It's probably just a job. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1721.84s)]
*  So what's yours and Vivian's relationship then? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1724.08s)]
*  Elon was talking about me on Twitter. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1725.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1732.88s)]
*  And I was like, listen, I'll have you on the broadcast if you're like man to man. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1734.0s)]
*  Because I had- he has not been a fan of mine for quite some time because I had his baby [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1739.76s)]
*  mama Grimes on a couple years ago on the show and ever since then- [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1744.96s)]
*  I'll be honest, I can see now why someone who never watches you or knows any better [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1748.64s)]
*  can think you're just a grifter when watching this convo. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1752.16s)]
*  What have I said in this conversation that isn't literally the same message that I repeat [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1755.28s)]
*  everywhere just adjusted slightly to the audience because I'm not a fucking weirdo [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1762.72s)]
*  and I'm going to talk about like the labor theory of value with Stiney. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1769.6799999999998s)]
*  I know I'm trying to understand what you were trying to say here, but like [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1773.9199999999998s)]
*  it's just a normal conversation being had with a normal person in the real world. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1777.6799999999998s)]
*  Normal, not because like Stiney is a, I mean, he's not a normal dude. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1782.96s)]
*  Obviously he's fucking part of the NELG boys. He's very wealthy. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1788.08s)]
*  But normal in the sense that he is, he represents the average American's political opinions a lot [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1793.04s)]
*  closer than you. I think I know what that chatter means. I think because you're not [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1800.0s)]
*  a personification of the SJW stereotype, they think you're putting up a fake character. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1803.04s)]
*  Yeah. But the point here, the point here is that like you can be chill and have fun [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1806.8s)]
*  and be a normal cool guy and still maintain your values. Because if you noticed in this conversation, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1813.12s)]
*  there are moments where I am gently and in a humorous way explaining my positions exactly [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1820.6399999999999s)]
*  with the other person said. Yeah. The issue on the other hand is that a lot of people [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1828.32s)]
*  only hyper-focused on the aesthetics and they can't comprehend that like you can be this way. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1835.6000000000001s)]
*  I want more people to be like me. I want more people to be like me. I want people to have [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1842.08s)]
*  their own personal interests and be able to navigate through conversations that might [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1848.48s)]
*  otherwise become difficult. Also the severity with which you talk about leftist topics to a [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1852.56s)]
*  community of leftist versus tone down version you portrayed a non-leftist could make people think [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1856.4s)]
*  you're softening up. I don't think you're softening up. I'm just saying you come across that way to [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1859.44s)]
*  people who aren't as familiar. Yeah. That's what fucking Ethan Klein tried to say was me [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1862.8s)]
*  lying to people and manipulating people. No, that's just called being a normal human being. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1867.44s)]
*  Like what the fuck? You know what I mean? It's just that's just a lot of people I think [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1873.28s)]
*  unironically are are anti-social and have lost touch with how to react and have a normal [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1878.8s)]
*  conversation with human beings. Does that make sense? You realize we fail where you win with [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1888.48s)]
*  normal people i.e. races and homophobes. No, that's also not true. That's also not true. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1894.32s)]
*  That's why I always say the greatest the greatest antidote to transphobia is a chill trans co-worker. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1901.1200000000001s)]
*  Okay, that's it. Like a like a chill trans co-worker who just works every single day [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1910.16s)]
*  at the job and talks to co-workers about their shared interests is perhaps the greatest antidote [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1918.72s)]
*  that you can ever have to people having transphobic opinions straight up and the trans people in this [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1925.28s)]
*  chat will will will reconfirm that. How many people gave you if you're a trans-osmotic head [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1931.8400000000001s)]
*  when you first start? I don't know if if someone suspect you were trans or whatever. I'm sure that [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1938.88s)]
*  that's always top of mind, right? I can't I don't know. I don't have any personal experience with [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1944.64s)]
*  this but like I'm sure that that's like a worry that you have right a worry understandably you [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1950.16s)]
*  have that like your co-workers are gonna look at you differently think about you differently [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1955.2800000000002s)]
*  and then you broach the subject not on the virtue of trans issues or whatever but instead you just [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1959.44s)]
*  like have a normal conversation with them and you slowly start recognizing that your [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1964.48s)]
*  your co-workers are initially your co-workers that initially might have treated you differently are [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1968.96s)]
*  like oh damn like you're just like us you know what I mean you're not an alien that's it that's it [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1974.8s)]
*  it's true I was transferred for a long time my trans co-worker was a jerk but I realized that [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1983.28s)]
*  was just her personality nice dude it's like that one tic-tac sound sample that lists like 30 things [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1986.48s)]
*  a person is but is a caricature of the most annoying liberals yeah you as a trans person [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1992.24s)]
*  have a secret weapon just being normal and around other human beings if you can crack a couple jokes [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=1998.56s)]
*  on top of that and not like weird autism jokes okay but like shit that some random co-worker [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2004.88s)]
*  could also find funny it's over it's a wrap you have eradicated transphobia one one person at a [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2012.48s)]
*  time asking anyone in your community is a big ass dog says conservative dad one it's hilarious [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2019.68s)]
*  that you're saying that because it's so untrue because as far as twitch streamer audiences goes [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2024.4s)]
*  demonstrably my audience is very much online and also have jobs that much you see from the [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2030.5600000000002s)]
*  fucking rallies that we go to and that much I experienced from being outside all the goddamn [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2038.3200000000002s)]
*  time and meeting you outside randomly so you know and he's not been a big fan well I mean [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2043.12s)]
*  that makes sense yeah to say the least and when you do something like that there's no like afraid [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2051.12s)]
*  not even afraid but like no he like bros before thing he's not my bro no but like I'm not going [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2057.6s)]
*  to know buddy's baby mama and having them on oh no I don't I don't you don't give a fuck okay [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2063.92s)]
*  especially not Elon and you know okay so go ahead but basically there was already apparently [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2068.88s)]
*  some animosity on that front I've never really been a fan of his to begin with but [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2075.52s)]
*  after he talked twitter as trans women very chill and open up about my gender but being [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2082.32s)]
*  chill doesn't help truly bigotry people it's not that case it's not that case unfortunately [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2086.48s)]
*  I've gone through a fair bit and plenty other dolls have done the same I think the best way to [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2089.84s)]
*  be is chill and firm I need to assert my boundaries in a normal tone I think is a bit more complicated [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2093.44s)]
*  than that yes I'm not I'm not saying this is like the don't take what I say literally it's not [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2097.2s)]
*  literally an antidote to the poison of transphobia okay yes of course there are still going to be [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2102.7999999999997s)]
*  incredibly bigoted people burgls calling me thank you for the 50 bones r-word I was um I refuse to [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2108.96s)]
*  say it is lame now it's lame to say why because like hedge fund managers are saying it so what so [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2116.64s)]
*  are you and me off camera probably no I I don't even say it off camera I just this is the first [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2124.56s)]
*  time I've I don't dropped it just to be clear Hassan said it I don't even say the but I I just [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2128.32s)]
*  think it's it's it's when you got 65 year old hedge fund managers trying to be edgy like you [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2133.2s)]
*  got Elon Musk saying it I haven't seen them have they been have they said that publicly so he said [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2140.72s)]
*  that to me call me a r-word he tweeted that yeah it's like bro you're a 60 year old man you're the [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2145.2s)]
*  rich person on the planet what the are you doing I did not know that he said that yeah it's like he [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2151.76s)]
*  blocked because because I had blocked him yeah and he was like he's afraid of me you know that's why [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2155.44s)]
*  he blocked me I was like no dumbass because you post a million times a day and you boost the [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2160.0s)]
*  algorithm so we see your nine gag memes but no party's like yo is this pretty cool that I'm going [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2165.2000000000003s)]

*  I don't I don't really think about it like that okay let's look there's two ways to go about it [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2179.84s)]
*  being annoying and a woke scold and being like well this is ableist language is problematic how [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2184.6400000000003s)]
*  dare you do this how dare you engage in this or or you say hey it's lame as fuck it's dork behavior [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2189.84s)]
*  which is true both of these both of these statements are true which one you use will [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2199.04s)]
*  vary greatly your success will depend on which one you go with when you have these conversations [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2206.08s)]
*  important lessons here for a lot of you to learn and take home with you and to demonstrate [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2213.52s)]
*  in the real world okay it is it is the same thing that I always do when I talk about trans issues [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2221.04s)]
*  as well and I think we we get into like trans women in sports at a certain point and I think [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2229.84s)]
*  it's important to also learn a lesson there as well so in your savage ways you went straight to his [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2236.0s)]
*  so I said if you don't want to come on then you know I'm gonna have grams on again I'm gonna have [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2242.8s)]

*  cerebral palsy at its end stage you know what I mean like it's a massive spectrum and even if [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2416.08s)]

*  something different now high support needs versus low support needs yeah so he's he's talking about [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2441.76s)]
*  like not just high support needs but like the highest the highest level of support needs [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2447.6000000000004s)]

*  that she probably gets like some kind of child support like the benefits of that for sure he's [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2569.76s)]
*  personally plenty better be paying out of that it'd be really difficult to see my kid with [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2576.32s)]

*  they they look at someone like Elon Musk who has like a weird pregnancy fetish it feels like where [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2597.68s)]

*  family values and he has 14 kids and he disowned his child like I think that's really talking about [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2649.92s)]
*  how she's dead because of the woke mama it's like you have some respect for yourself you know what [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2656.48s)]
*  I mean yeah I feel like that's that's pretty that's pretty weird like maybe it's because I'm Turkish [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2661.52s)]
*  but like it would take so much for me to publicly disown a family member like they'd have to be a [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2665.84s)]
*  you know what I mean yeah like they would have to be like dude that's such as someone I'm sorry [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2673.52s)]
*  like crazy amounts of crimes for me to be like yeah he's not the best guy you know what I mean [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2678.4s)]
*  you would agree that's that's a tough situation but I will tell you like especially as a dad who I [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2683.04s)]
*  think about right away and who gets a lot of dwayne wade yeah because his uh he's a great dad he's [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2687.1200000000003s)]

*  you're coming from and I think as a father you have that obligation to I mean a guy who can't [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2700.56s)]
*  spend time with their families and a man according to Michael Corleone so yeah that's you're 100% [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2705.1200000000003s)]
*  right Michael Corleone was 100% right that's why that's one of the greatest movies of all time [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2710.7200000000003s)]
*  because it preaches the best morals so I do I do see what you're saying there what do you what do [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2714.2400000000002s)]
*  you think about uh you told you came in here in a you got the exclusive red robe from Kanye so I [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2719.04s)]
*  just want to see what you think about his the red robe what do you mean like you saw his black robe [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2725.04s)]
*  uh-huh okay you don't get the joke oh I misunderstood my bad oh you were yeah I'm sorry I should have [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2729.36s)]
*  got you what the I should have gone with it I thought you were quick on your feet I should have [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2735.36s)]
*  I should have went bit for bit yeah I was confused I was like what would you prefer to wear the black [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2739.36s)]
*  one or the red one would I prefer to wear either of the Kanye robes you have to pick the black [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2743.92s)]
*  but if I have to wear one I probably go with the black one because the red one is literally also a [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2748.24s)]
*  Klan's robe yeah at least I don't think the Klan has a they probably have a black robe too I haven't [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2752.24s)]
*  seen that one even in movies yeah even like Harold and Kumar have you seen her in the Kumar yeah [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2756.4799999999996s)]

*  I see the Klan robe many times when we go to the meetings like me and Kanye yeah yeah exactly I've [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2766.0s)]
*  seen it uh what do you think about his whole rant too late he actually too late for me to pick up on [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2770.3199999999997s)]
*  the bit now I mean he's a he's a bad guy oh I thought you were about to say he's a friend of [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2775.6s)]
*  the show no no no boys Kanye collab you know I mean that guy's talked even the last couple days [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2780.4s)]
*  about supporting Diddy or Kelly no no he's he's like I mean it's obvious he's lost his mind like [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2786.16s)]
*  it's just he did I I don't agree with anything he has said but he did say one thing today oh I [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2793.44s)]
*  thought your brother I actually did graduation no he did you consider graduation but he tweeted [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2799.12s)]
*  why am I need a purse when I'm the bag and it that actually had me thinking because all these [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2805.52s)]
*  chicks that have Birkin bags and Chanel bags they never actually have money in there that always [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2810.96s)]
*  with the guy that has the money right I don't know I mean I feel like there's rich rich women [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2816.0s)]
*  out there that probably have money in there but from where I don't know from working what are they [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2821.04s)]
*  doing who knows they could be doing anything they could be an accountant I want to I want to like [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2826.8s)]
*  I want to find a chick that has a Birkin bag he's trying to get me to be [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2831.68s)]
*  misusing his thing so bad and I'm just not giving it to him at all I'm like oh no [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2835.6s)]
*  or a Chanel bag that doesn't do OnlyFans or something like that [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2845.04s)]
*  I feel like you have a like a sampling bias here okay is I and I'm around sex workers all the time [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2850.3999999999996s)]
*  but like that's not the only women that I know you know what I mean yeah and I think I'm a little [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2857.44s)]
*  bit too trapped in that right now but that's not the only women I know I feel I see that a lot with [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2862.16s)]
*  uh with like uh those podcasts where they just like will hire women off of like sugar baby websites [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2867.52s)]
*  to like berate them you know what I'm talking about no no I'm not saying you do that but those guys [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2874.48s)]
*  like uh Fresh and Fit right or um there's another podcast I can't remember the ever yeah yeah [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2880.16s)]
*  exactly they will like hire women off these websites I don't I don't like that and then [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2887.2s)]
*  they're like oh you're oh you're speaking back to me who watches this you know what's actually [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2891.2799999999997s)]
*  funny about that though what it is I don't know why I just let us but I've had Dean Withers on a [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2897.8399999999997s)]
*  couple times you and him would probably hang out yeah I I mean I know him yeah yeah uh but [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2902.4799999999996s)]
*  it was actually just so ironic because he's definitely would have your stance be like yo I [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2908.9599999999996s)]
*  don't support the Fresh and Fit or whatever I don't know this podcast and I had this girl on [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2913.76s)]
*  and they were going back and forth going back and forth yeah he just stops and he goes can you name [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2917.92s)]
*  all the continents I just started saying that they would say to girls and I was just like bro like [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2921.84s)]
*  damn it's it's kind of weird like he that's that's why because she named all the confidence [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2927.0400000000004s)]
*  we I didn't I didn't know how to answer because we're not gonna uh support that kind of behavior [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2932.0800000000004s)]
*  on this show oh you're like I'm a feminist you came out and you're like well she's bad and I'm [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2936.2400000000002s)]
*  gonna say you know what you don't answer that she don't need to if she wasn't bad you'd be [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2939.92s)]
*  like you'd be cooking her too? Then you answer that fucking question yeah no but I think I love that he went she's bad so I defended her [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2944.16s)]
*  it's so funny uh I just think too that what I've noticed with having liberals conservatives and [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2953.44s)]
*  being like around both you just kind of get whether you agree with him or not you at least get more [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2960.4s)]
*  genuine and you know what you're getting like what you see is what you get with the conservative side [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2965.12s)]
*  oh with conservatives yeah I think a lot of the time liberals are faking it I think Gavin Newsom [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2969.6s)]
*  and me could have a great time hit a bar go have a good time and act the same way that you would [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2974.7999999999997s)]
*  expect the conservatives to act you know have that kind of bro talk and I think that a lot of the [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2980.0s)]
*  liberals really play into their audience I guess maybe maybe some liberals do I'm not one of those [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2986.48s)]
*  people I mean I'm very genuine too but I think like but off camera and on camera like the way [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2991.52s)]
*  I'm talking to you right now is not any different than it would be off camera yeah I can't fake it [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=2997.36s)]
*  I'm live eight hours a day yeah you know what I mean yeah so would you agree with that assessment [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3002.56s)]
*  though that it seems more like because I did hang out with some of these guys off camera and I don't [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3007.2000000000003s)]
*  think that they actually believe all they say but they know like listen you can really get this [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3012.0s)]
*  on the internet you can really get this loyal cult fan base if you are super leftist or you really [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3017.1200000000003s)]
*  far left that buy into everything you say and you got to double down and you got to stick with that [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3022.4s)]
*  or they will turn on you I think there's a lot more pressure on the left side of things in the [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3027.2s)]
*  right side yes and no I think there's less infighting on the right if that's what you mean [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3031.52s)]
*  but I mean the Israel stuff is a major point of contention now on the right too there's like a lot [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3038.0s)]
*  of drama there but um I think there's disingenuous grifters on the right there's disingenuous grifters [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3042.7999999999997s)]
*  on the left as well I maintain the position that it's like for the reasons that you just mentioned [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3050.8799999999997s)]
*  it's a lot harder to grift to the left because everybody's constantly up here like your own [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3056.16s)]
*  allies are constantly up being like you're not sufficiently woke or on this issue or that issue [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3062.72s)]
*  that's actually one of my I think big distinctions with like a lot of other people is that whenever [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3067.92s)]
*  someone does that to me I'm like shut the I don't care yeah you know I was I was liberal my entire [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3072.56s)]
*  life I'm from Denver Colorado I went to but I'm not a liberal that's the difference like I'm not [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3078.72s)]
*  I think I have a different worldview than liberals in general sure but what I'm saying is because I [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3083.52s)]
*  I've gotten backlash for supporting Trump obviously certain people from back home don't [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3089.36s)]
*  talk to me anymore my own mother didn't talk to me for six months so like there are people that have [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3093.6000000000004s)]
*  that kind of hatred that if you support this guy I'm not gonna affiliate with you at all [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3098.6400000000003s)]
*  for family it's a little different but I understand why people my mom had me on me for six months bro [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3103.2000000000003s)]
*  but I mean I I understand why people your friends would get mad at you over that for sure because [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3108.16s)]
*  like supporting Trump is one thing but then you also like you had him on the show and stuff you [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3114.64s)]
*  know what I mean it's like you're offering your platform to him but you can't really platform the [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3120.4s)]
*  president he's platforming you technically yeah you know what I mean like it I so I get that argument [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3124.16s)]
*  as well he did a great you got to admit that his strategy uh oh yeah the campaign I mean he for [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3128.88s)]
*  sure he but no one else can do that anyway like JD Vance was on your pod I remember watching that [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3135.04s)]
*  and he sucks like he's so he's I think he's actually the smartest one yes smart doesn't [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3141.44s)]
*  mean telegenic or charismatic though oh yeah he's just such a whiny little baby when I hear him talk [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3146.88s)]
*  I'm like ugh shut the dude why I mean do you have a specific example yeah many as a matter of fact [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3152.88s)]
*  he's always he first of all he has the vibes of a person this is like desperately trying to get you [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3160.64s)]
*  to like him but from the perspective of a of an intelligent guy for sure yeah he is an intelligent [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3167.2s)]
*  dude um but he just comes across as so fake I don't know he has the guy he has the fake uh [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3172.48s)]
*  politician vibes down pat he just says that you agree with that's why you don't read it in my [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3181.2s)]
*  opinion like like Kamala Harris is obviously a very inauthentic person like for sure yeah but I [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3186.88s)]
*  also don't think like I don't know why it was always in my head but I always just pictured [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3194.08s)]
*  this is why one of the reasons why I actually do appreciate Trump more it I was thinking of the have [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3198.4s)]
*  you said thank you yet but I didn't mention that I should have mentioned that as an example because [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3204.2400000000002s)]
*  that's like such a great example another thing that he did yesterday is a great example of this [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3208.8s)]
*  where he's like trying to do this mealy-mouthed squishy liberal apology for eroding due process [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3214.4s)]
*  which is a straightforward fascism where he's just like oh but we've been invaded by so many [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3221.76s)]
*  so many migrants my parents built this country well how can you expect us to go to due process [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3230.4s)]
*  with 20 million peoples and it's like dude shut the fuck up just say it with your goddamn chest [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3238.96s)]

*  be dumb or immoral to disagree with me it's an easy way to go through life where is the due process [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3263.12s)]
*  thing this is the real the due process response that I saw was so fucking annoying I got so mad [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3267.68s)]
*  I got so mad that I couldn't fucking tweet about it that's how mad I got I can't stand this fucking [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3277.3599999999997s)]
*  asshole in a lengthy expose published Tuesday Vance wrote here this is it this is it considering that [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3281.68s)]
*  Joe Biden allowed 20 million illegal aliens into our country this place is extraordinary burdens on [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3286.48s)]
*  our country our schools hospitals housing and essential services were overwhelmed on top of [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3290.8799999999997s)]
*  that many of these illegal aliens committed violent crimes facilitated fentanyl and sex [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3294.72s)]
*  trafficking that's the situation we inherited the American people elected Trump to solve this [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3297.92s)]
*  problem the president successfully stopped the inflow of illegal aliens to say the administration [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3302.7999999999997s)]
*  must observe due process is to beg the question what processes do is a function of our resources [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3306.8799999999997s)]
*  the public interest he's like sorry we can't have due process because it's just too hard like why [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3313.12s)]
*  are you effort posting about the the erosion of a fundamental right for all people citizen and [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3320.4s)]

*  I mean oh yeah have you said thank you have you said thank you once for the death camps that we're [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3340.8s)]

*  decisions he's calling the shots I picture Kamala just like five people around her telling her what [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3352.96s)]
*  to do her getting frustrated she doesn't know what to do like she was kind of just like I mean I think [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3359.3599999999997s)]
*  for the record I think when it comes to being the president it's probably good to listen to advisors [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3363.44s)]
*  no I agree with you know I agree I don't know who to listen to make all the decisions and I agree with [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3369.2s)]
*  that but I'm saying he at the end of the day is gonna go with what he believes in like and and [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3373.52s)]
*  he's gonna tell you exactly what he believes like everything he says he's gonna do he's probably gonna [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3378.96s)]

*  the the last election you ever do anything that's not like politics driven something I noticed about [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3489.6s)]
*  you and h3 is I'm and I asked each day this I went on a show last week and I was like bro do you guys [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3497.12s)]
*  ever like talk about anything positive like is there a here no of course well I haven't noticed [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3501.52s)]
*  no I mean because we're you know we're on a podcast you want to if you're asking me questions [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3507.2s)]
*  about you know politics I'm going to be political what do you think about the fact that they [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3511.3599999999997s)]
*  someone released the mount rushmore of streamers uh-huh did you see that photo I think so yeah it [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3515.52s)]
*  was aiden kai speed and rice gum rice gum yeah I thought that was crazy you didn't agree with that [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3520.7999999999997s)]
*  no I mean I'm not saying obviously on it you at no no no no I I wouldn't okay so what was what was [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3528.3199999999997s)]
*  crazy about that um I think just be honest you should be replaced with who if I'm being honest [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3533.84s)]
*  like I think speed and Kai are are deserving of that for sure I guess like it's hard because [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3540.8s)]
*  how do you not think Aiden is deserving no I that's what I was gonna say I think it's hard [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3548.48s)]
*  because on the one hand like I understand because Aiden is in some ways responsible for at least the [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3552.56s)]
*  beginning stages of like Kai and speed as well like he was a he was a as a content creator I'm [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3559.68s)]
*  not talking about his politics I'm not talking about what he does now but as a content creator [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3565.12s)]
*  I think he he played a big role in that right he brought a lot of uh of the W and L community up [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3568.48s)]
*  so here's what I'm gonna say I'm streaming and on the content sphere in general and I think that [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3575.2000000000003s)]
*  was really good but overall if you're looking at like the accurate history of it all uh it if you [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3578.8s)]
*  dive a little bit further than that like I would say I don't really agree with the guy either but [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3585.92s)]
*  ninja probably oh yeah yeah like that's that's well that's a very fair argument yeah I think ninja [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3590.32s)]
*  I would say probably deserves to be up there here's what I think and I thought you were bigger [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3595.76s)]
*  because you poop all the time he'd be a bigger NBA guy no okay but I've been like they talk about [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3601.6800000000003s)]
*  you know who Nikola Jokic is of course okay so they talk about how him and curry aren't like [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3606.96s)]
*  top 10 players of all time which is the dumbest thing ever ESPN you guys should be ashamed of [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3611.28s)]
*  yourselves you're all uh but they're in a sense people especially Steph that completely changed [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3615.68s)]
*  the NBA forever yeah and I kind of look at Aiden as that guy like I didn't really see anybody doing [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3622.72s)]
*  these like streams where they would just kick it have these rappers on shoot it treat it more as [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3627.68s)]
*  like an interview and just hanging out I think he really kind of revolutionized that and he changed [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3632.08s)]
*  the game a little bit yeah I mean it's I'm not in that it's not for a lack of trying it's just like [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3636.8799999999997s)]
*  he was the first to be able to get access to these types of people so he changed kind of the [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3641.6s)]
*  streaming game in that regard yeah I think that he was he was pivotal that's why I said like he is [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3645.7599999999998s)]
*  it's hard not to it's hard to say like Kai and speed are formative and important but then say [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3652.0s)]
*  that Aiden is not yeah in that regard for sure like I'm not undermining that as a content creator [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3657.8399999999997s)]
*  in and of itself you talked about uh speed recently I love speed I do too he's I mean [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3663.52s)]
*  he's a superstar bro like no he might be one of the biggest celebrities in the world [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3670.48s)]
*  yeah for sure when I saw him internationally he definitely is I think he was he was at some spot [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3675.2000000000003s)]
*  in China and he was eating and he was like I'm gonna go see what the crowd is outside [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3681.36s)]
*  and it looked like in beetles or the stones were in town yeah in the states because he's also been [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=3684.56s)]

*  Um... [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4332.44s)]
*  Because you are a hooper. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4334.44s)]
*  Maybe... [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4335.44s)]
*  Like coming off the bench. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4336.44s)]
*  Nah, don't call trans people Id Hasan. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4337.44s)]
*  What? What the f**k are you saying? [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4340.44s)]
*  I don't think so. I think they still cook me. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4341.44s)]
*  Okay. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4344.44s)]
*  Yeah. That's the thing. It also depends, right? [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4345.44s)]
*  They're hosting an open tryout on April 12th for men to practice against the LA women's team. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4349.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4355.44s)]
*  I'm gonna pull up. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4356.44s)]
*  I'm gonna go for 30. I don't know when I'm gonna get it. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4357.44s)]
*  They f**king destroy your soul. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4359.44s)]
*  Okay, you've never seen me play. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4361.44s)]
*  I mean, bro. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4362.44s)]
*  I'm looking at you right now. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4363.44s)]
*  I can tell. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4364.44s)]
*  Bro, I'm strong, bro. I'm strong and I can shoot. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4365.44s)]
*  They would f**king pull up. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4367.44s)]
*  I would love to see that. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4368.44s)]
*  Alright, well you can pull up. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4369.44s)]
*  I can't wait. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4370.44s)]
*  Dude, me and you could run the pick and roll all day and we would actually go crazy. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4371.44s)]
*  No, we wouldn't. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4374.44s)]
*  Yes, we would. Well, let's try it. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4375.44s)]
*  You think these are some... [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4376.44s)]
*  What are you doing on April 12th? [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4377.44s)]
*  You are... [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4378.44s)]
*  No, but I know. I'm confident in my game. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4379.44s)]
*  I'd be down, but we're gonna get embarrassed. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4381.44s)]
*  No, pick and roll. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4383.44s)]
*  Bro, bro. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4385.44s)]
*  You think these are like... [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4386.44s)]
*  You would not be in the WNBA, dude. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4388.44s)]
*  The worst WNBA player to ever would f**king cook your a**. You are not. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4389.44s)]
*  I know. That's what I'm saying. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4393.44s)]
*  I was thinking like maybe like a really bench warmer. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4396.44s)]
*  I could get like a couple shots off, but yeah, of course I would f**king lose. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4400.44s)]
*  That's my point. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4403.44s)]
*  This is the classic dumb guy argument where people are just like... [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4405.44s)]
*  Classic dumb guy argument is like, no, these professional basketball players, we could destroy them because they're women. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4409.44s)]
*  It's like, are you kidding me? That's their whole life, dude. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4415.44s)]
*  Like Dainty, you think these are like your mom or your sister or something. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4418.44s)]
*  Like these are professional athletes. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4423.44s)]
*  Okay, here's what you gotta do. You can do this. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4425.44s)]
*  I have played against women. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4427.44s)]
*  No, and they're good, but get the rebound and pass me the ball and we will win the game. I promise you. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4428.44s)]
*  It's not that easy. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4433.44s)]
*  Get the rebound and give me the rock and we will be in there and we will win. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4434.44s)]
*  They would cook us. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4438.44s)]
*  Let's go, bro. It's an open tryout. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4440.44s)]
*  If we're talking like... [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4442.44s)]
*  Kaelin, yes. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4443.44s)]
*  If we're talking like an NCAA Division I athlete, like a male who's an NCAA Division I athlete, basketball, playing against the women's team, there's definitely an athletic advantage for a cisgender man for sure. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4444.44s)]
*  Now I'm starting to get the vibes. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4461.44s)]
*  Even then there's a wide range. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4463.44s)]
*  I'm starting to get the vibes. You're like the big man that only shoots threes. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4465.44s)]
*  Like you're afraid to play paint. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4468.44s)]
*  I do shoot a lot of threes. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4469.44s)]
*  Yeah, see, you gotta play your size. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4470.44s)]
*  I know how to play big. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4471.44s)]
*  Oh, okay. You're giving me that vibe. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4473.44s)]
*  You know the guy you play pick up with that only shoots threes? He's the biggest guy. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4475.44s)]
*  As long as you make it. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4479.44s)]
*  He won't play paint. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4480.44s)]
*  Who cares? Three's bigger than two. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4481.44s)]
*  No, you're wrong, bro. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4482.44s)]
*  We just talked about how Steph Curry redefined the game. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4483.44s)]
*  You can't shoot off the dribble like that. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4485.44s)]
*  You can't shoot off the dribble. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4487.44s)]
*  No, Wemby, I think if he stays healthy, he'll be the best player ever. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4488.44s)]
*  I think so, too. We'll see. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4491.44s)]
*  He needs to put some beef on the bones. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4493.44s)]
*  It's probably hard to gain weight when you're that f***ed. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4495.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4497.44s)]
*  Alien. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4498.44s)]
*  Are you a fan of the UFC? [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4500.44s)]
*  I like the UFC. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4501.44s)]
*  Okay. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4503.44s)]
*  Khabib. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4504.44s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4505.44s)]
*  I like the eagle. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4506.44s)]
*  I'll rock with McGregor. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4507.44s)]
*  Yeah, the Dagestanis, they clean house out there. It's crazy. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4509.44s)]
*  Well, because they have no distractions, bro. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4513.44s)]
*  Bro, you can't compete a biological man with a woman. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4515.44s)]
*  That is the stupid shit like they shown in South Park. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4517.44s)]
*  South Park, bro, pulled up South Park as a reference to why something in the real world could not work. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4520.44s)]
*  That's amazing, dude. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4526.44s)]
*  Like you didn't even go live action with it. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4528.44s)]
*  You went fucking South Park, dude. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4530.44s)]
*  What the f***? [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4533.44s)]
*  Why would you demonstrate how intellectually stunted you are like this? [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4534.44s)]
*  Work-cited South Park. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4540.44s)]
*  God damn. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4543.44s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4544.44s)]
*  They get rich and then they just have money. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4545.44s)]
*  Like they don't. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4547.44s)]
*  They don't experience a lot of the other stuff. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4548.44s)]
*  I agree with you, but I'm saying when you live in a place like Dagestan, you don't have access to the type of things that you do in Brazil, Ireland, America. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4549.44s)]
*  Those guys still go to like Dubai and they travel. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4558.44s)]
*  They just got discipline. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4562.44s)]
*  That's what it is. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4564.44s)]
*  That's what their development is. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4565.44s)]
*  That's what their upbringing is. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4566.44s)]
*  It's just different. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4567.44s)]
*  Have you ever watched McGregor like, I don't know if you scroll on TikTok, but you could see a lot of his like motivational stuff from years ago. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4568.44s)]
*  I wonder if he kept what I said here. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4576.44s)]
*  This is the part that I was interested about because I was just straight up like Connor McGregor is a rapist. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4578.44s)]
*  I was like, nope, because he was trying to like say how much Connor McGregor's like trajectory meant to him. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4582.44s)]
*  And I just straight up was like, nope. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4589.44s)]
*  Coming up when he was I think I think I've seen some of it because I've seen compilations of like how he changed as a person after and how like that kind of ruined his entire person. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4591.44s)]
*  I actually tell everybody this too. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4603.44s)]
*  And this is just something that I witnessed. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4604.44s)]
*  But I've been a huge like he's an inspiration to me. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4606.44s)]
*  Even when he was just starting in the UFC, he was so confident. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4609.44s)]
*  I wonder if he did. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4613.44s)]
*  He might have caught my response. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4614.44s)]
*  He said in the beginning he was like, I'm only fighting to get rich, to take care of my family, to take care of my kids, kids. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4616.44s)]
*  And I don't give a f**k about anything else. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4622.44s)]
*  Let me say something. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4624.44s)]
*  I don't really f**k with them. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4625.44s)]
*  This is what Connie's been tweeting about too. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4626.44s)]
*  I think he said. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4630.44s)]
*  Connie? [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4631.44s)]
*  Oh, Connie said something about like, oh, yeah, I think he did. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4632.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4635.44s)]
*  I said, I don't really f**k with them. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4636.44s)]
*  And then I just straight up laid into Connor McGurk. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4637.44s)]
*  I was like, no dog. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4640.44s)]
*  He's a rapist. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4641.44s)]
*  I literally was like, nope, he's a rapist, dude. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4642.44s)]
*  Like, and not not even like a he said she said type situation. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4646.44s)]
*  I was like, no, that motherfucker is a convicted rapist. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4650.44s)]
*  I think I also then started railing into the admin too. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4654.44s)]
*  I was like, it's like rapist. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4658.44s)]
*  Well, I can't remember exactly what it was. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4659.44s)]
*  Blame Megafonics. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4661.44s)]
*  Yeah, Megafonics. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4662.44s)]
*  Why'd you cut that, dude? [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4663.44s)]
*  That's f**ked up. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4664.44s)]
*  Megafonics is his producer. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4665.44s)]
*  No, I'm just kidding. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4666.44s)]
*  I mean, it's fine. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4667.44s)]
*  Whatever. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4668.44s)]
*  I don't care. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4669.44s)]
*  Every CEO should leverage their power to get something crazy like that. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4670.44s)]
*  That's weird. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4674.44s)]
*  Why don't you just be a nice person? [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4675.44s)]
*  And I agree with you. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4677.44s)]
*  But what I'm saying is that like, what you were going off, what you're saying is these [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4678.44s)]
*  people get into that position of power. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4683.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4685.44s)]
*  And then they just use that. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4686.44s)]
*  Was that where you're going after? [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4687.44s)]
*  No, no, I wasn't going to say that. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4688.44s)]
*  I was going to say people that get into a position of power with like profound privilege [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4690.44s)]
*  and then from that platform, they just start sh**ting on people that have less than them. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4695.44s)]
*  I just, I think they're losers, dude. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4700.44s)]
*  Who does that? [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4702.44s)]
*  That's what it is. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4703.44s)]
*  Like all these guys like Conor McGurk being like immigrants are ruining Ireland. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4704.44s)]
*  It's like, bro, like these are people that are just trying to survive. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4708.44s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4712.44s)]
*  Like that's just the way I see it. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4713.44s)]
*  Like I don't think some random Guatemalan dude or Salvadoran dude that like trekked [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4715.44s)]
*  2000 miles to come here is a bad dude. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4721.44s)]
*  I don't disagree with you, but you have to do things the right way. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4724.44s)]
*  And there are people that try and do things the right way. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4728.44s)]
*  No, but here's the problem in terms of doing things the right way. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4730.44s)]
*  Of course, you think those guys wouldn't want to come in through the legal process [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4734.44s)]
*  and they're just like adventurists and they just think like, oh, it's so much more cool [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4738.44s)]
*  if I go through the desert. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4742.44s)]
*  No, the right way is inaccessible. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4743.44s)]
*  So when you make certain things inaccessible, people that are desperate are going to go [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4746.44s)]
*  the wrong way. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4750.44s)]
*  No, I don't think that's how it has to be. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4751.44s)]
*  You can't just let everybody in here. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4753.44s)]
*  I think it'd be better if we processed every single person that's like making a legal [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4755.44s)]
*  asylum claim expeditiously and allow them to become taxpaying citizens, which they already [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4759.44s)]
*  do pay taxes, but even pay more taxes and participate in the American economy in even [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4765.44s)]
*  more meaningful ways. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4770.44s)]
*  That's my assessment of the situation. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4772.44s)]
*  But also, I think Connor was literally talking about like documented immigrants anyway, [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4774.44s)]
*  because it's Ireland. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4778.44s)]
*  Ireland doesn't have like a big undocumented immigrant issue. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4780.44s)]
*  No, but I'm planning on going soon. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4783.44s)]
*  Bro, it's awesome. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4784.44s)]
*  Ireland is dope. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4786.44s)]
*  It's very, very fucking cool. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4787.44s)]
*  Their politics are very good. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4789.44s)]
*  Well, how do you feel about like the Bonnie Blue and like the Lily Phillips? [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4791.44s)]
*  They took the Internet by storm. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4794.44s)]
*  Are those the two ladies that are like guys in a day? [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4796.44s)]
*  Yo, I have so much respect for them. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4799.44s)]
*  Really? [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4803.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4804.44s)]
*  I think it's so impressive. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4805.44s)]
*  What is impressive about that? [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4806.44s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4807.44s)]
*  Can you fuck a thousand women in one day? [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4808.44s)]
*  If I have the substances around me. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4811.44s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm saying. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4814.44s)]
*  I think I could do 200. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4816.44s)]
*  I feel like the... [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4818.44s)]
*  What's the most you could do? [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4820.44s)]
*  The... [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4821.44s)]
*  Could you do more than 20? [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4822.44s)]
*  No. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4823.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4824.44s)]
*  Yours has to be all like... [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4825.44s)]
*  I don't think... [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4826.44s)]
*  You got to have that physical connection, emotional connection to do it. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4827.44s)]
*  That, but also like... [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4830.44s)]
*  No, I mean, I'm a dude at the end of the day. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4831.44s)]
*  I'm still going to fuck you. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4833.44s)]
*  But like, I just think that I would not have the stamina to be able to do that. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4835.44s)]
*  So I do think... [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4840.44s)]
*  You don't think there's anything about that that's too degenerate though? [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4841.44s)]
*  There's something that's physically impressive about that. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4844.44s)]
*  Undeniably so. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4847.44s)]
*  Okay, so what do you think is more impressive? [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4851.44s)]
*  What's more impressive, Bron playing back to backs at 40 or Bonnie Blue taking a thousand in one day? [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4852.44s)]
*  Ooh, that's a good one. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4857.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4859.44s)]
*  I think... [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4860.44s)]
*  It's hard. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4861.44s)]
*  I'm a big LeBron Glaser, so I'm going to go with that. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4862.44s)]
*  You too. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4864.44s)]
*  I think, yeah, I think LeBron James. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4865.44s)]
*  Yeah, okay, good. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4866.44s)]
*  But yeah, at the age of 40 especially. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4867.44s)]
*  He hit me in the... [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4869.44s)]
*  He hit me in my fucking soft spot. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4871.44s)]
*  He hit me... [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4873.44s)]
*  He ulted. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4874.44s)]
*  You compare anything that LeBron James does to anyone else, I'm going to say LeBron James. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4875.44s)]
*  Very few exceptions, you know what I mean? [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4881.44s)]
*  Actually, god damn. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4883.44s)]
*  He's... [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4884.44s)]
*  What an icon. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4885.44s)]
*  What a fucking icon. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4886.44s)]
*  Who's your Mount Rushmore of NBA guys? [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4887.44s)]
*  Mount Rushmore of NBA guys? [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4888.44s)]
*  I mean, it's just... [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4890.44s)]
*  Four people, bro. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4891.44s)]
*  It's just generational, so I think it's... [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4892.44s)]
*  No, you gotta just pick four. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4894.44s)]
*  Like across the board? [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4895.44s)]
*  Yeah, bro. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4896.44s)]
*  You can't... [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4897.44s)]
*  I mean, it's LeBron James, Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, and... [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4898.44s)]
*  Mmm. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4904.44s)]
*  You know what? [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4905.44s)]
*  I'm going to do a sleeper pick, Tim Duncan. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4908.44s)]
*  Which is not even a sleeper pick? [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4912.44s)]
*  But that's how I know you know the NBA. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4913.44s)]
*  But that's not even a sleeper pick, but that's not someone I think that would... [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4914.44s)]
*  He's probably the best four of all time. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4918.44s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think he would get the respect he deserves in that regard in that situation. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4920.44s)]
*  No, he's incredible. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4924.44s)]
*  I'll give you that. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4925.44s)]
*  I think Steph should be on there, but yes. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4926.44s)]
*  I think Steph Curry is a great player. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4929.44s)]
*  I had to do an unk pick, dude. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4931.44s)]
*  Yeah, I guess... [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4933.44s)]
*  I mean, you got so many. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4934.44s)]
*  It's the NBA chat. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4935.44s)]
*  I know. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4936.44s)]
*  Kobe, Shaq, yes, I know. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4937.44s)]
*  I know. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4939.44s)]
*  But like, even maybe Dirk for sure. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4940.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4943.44s)]
*  And it is undeniable that he has changed the game. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4944.44s)]
*  Some might even say for the worse. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4946.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4948.44s)]
*  But... [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4949.44s)]
*  No, I mean, yeah, it's definitely made the game not as physical and like... [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4950.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4952.44s)]
*  A little bit... [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4953.44s)]
*  Listen, three is bigger than two. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4954.44s)]
*  That's true. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4955.44s)]
*  That's what it is. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4956.44s)]
*  We can both do math here. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4957.44s)]
*  Yeah, that's what it is. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4958.44s)]
*  If you can have the same consistency with your three point shot, ain't nobody's taking those [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4959.44s)]
*  long range middies like Kevin Garnett anymore. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4964.44s)]
*  No, they're not. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4966.44s)]
*  That's done. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4967.44s)]
*  I miss KG. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4968.44s)]
*  Do you ever watch... [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4969.44s)]
*  I love Jeff Teague. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4970.44s)]
*  Do you ever watch him? [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4971.44s)]
*  Who? [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4972.44s)]
*  Jeff Teague. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4973.44s)]
*  He played point guard for a while. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4974.44s)]
*  He just talks NBA stories. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4975.44s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4976.44s)]

*  No. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4979.44s)]
*  No? [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4980.44s)]
*  No, I don't know who Lou Williams is. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4981.44s)]
*  Okay, I'm just gonna tell you real quick. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4982.44s)]
*  He's one of the best scorers. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4983.44s)]
*  Six man. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4984.44s)]
*  Okay. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4985.44s)]
*  And he literally told the story. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4986.44s)]
*  He was like, yeah, I showed up to Atlanta. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4987.44s)]
*  He played for the Hawks. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4988.44s)]
*  He was like, yeah, I went to Magic City until 8 or 9 a.m., blacked out, played the Knicks [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4989.44s)]
*  at noon. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4995.44s)]
*  And he was like, bro, I had no choice, went and told Doc Rivers, I can't play, I'm blacked [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=4996.44s)]
*  out right now. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5002.44s)]
*  And he said Doc made me play the entire set of quarters so I could sweat it out. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5003.44s)]
*  And then he had 25 in the fourth quarter, hammered. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5008.44s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5011.44s)]
*  Crazy, bro. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5012.44s)]
*  This is like, the NBA is not like that anymore. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5013.44s)]
*  That's the athlete. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5015.44s)]
*  What? [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5016.44s)]
*  Harden. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5017.44s)]

*  Harden. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5019.44s)]

*  I mean, like, that was just a story to tell. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5021.44s)]
*  But, all right, last thing I want to leave you with is, can I fix the beef between you [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5022.44s)]
*  and H3? [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5027.44s)]
*  I mean, look, it's not on my end. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5028.44s)]
*  Well, first of all, we do have significant disagree. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5030.44s)]
*  You retweeted AI picks of Garcia and that Democrat guy. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5034.44s)]
*  What? [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5038.44s)]
*  AI picks? [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5039.44s)]
*  What are you saying? [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5040.44s)]
*  Does Senator Chris Van Hollen also tweet AI picks? [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5041.44s)]
*  Bro, what is going on, dude? [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5045.44s)]
*  Yo, yo. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5048.44s)]

*  Everything's computer. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5061.44s)]
*  I know. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5062.44s)]

*  Oh my God. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5067.44s)]
*  Zoomers are done. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5069.44s)]
*  Motherfuckers are seeing AI everywhere, dude. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5071.44s)]
*  Trump is imposing martial law on April 20th. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5074.44s)]
*  Everyone's dead, including, including, including Kilmar. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5077.44s)]
*  He's dead. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5080.44s)]
*  This is an AI pick. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5081.44s)]
*  What the fuck is happening? [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5082.44s)]
*  Not their reasoning being this. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5084.44s)]
*  I can't find it in the news. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5086.44s)]
*  Elderly lady. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5087.44s)]
*  Oh, sorry. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5088.44s)]
*  Couldn't find any article about it yet because it just happened. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5089.44s)]
*  I didn't realize your name was elderly lady. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5093.44s)]
*  Now I feel bad. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5095.44s)]
*  I'm sorry for yelling. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5096.44s)]
*  Yes, it's not. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5098.44s)]
*  I like that you have. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5099.44s)]
*  I like that you and only you, if you're using that, you are [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5101.44s)]
*  thinking that everything is AI picks because I would rather [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5105.44s)]
*  have elderly ladies think everything is AI picks than fall for AI picks in general. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5109.44s)]
*  So that's good. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5115.44s)]
*  There's a healthy skeptical approach that you have. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5116.44s)]
*  But for everybody else, that's not an elderly lady. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5119.44s)]
*  Don't fucking do this. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5122.44s)]
*  Okay. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5124.44s)]
*  It's good. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5125.44s)]
*  It's a healthy. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5126.44s)]
*  It's a healthy default position to have. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5127.44s)]
*  If you are an elderly lady, I want my mom to have this position as well, because I constantly [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5130.44s)]
*  catch her watching AI videos of dogs and stuff on on Instagram. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5135.44s)]
*  And I suspect that once you once you watch one AI video, Instagram only serves you AI [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5141.44s)]
*  videos. And that's scary. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5148.44s)]
*  It's so scary. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5150.44s)]
*  So it's good that you have that approach. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5152.44s)]
*  It's healthy skepticism. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5155.44s)]
*  Don't let anybody don't let anybody take you away from that. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5157.44s)]
*  Okay. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5161.44s)]
*  Okay. It's crazy because I'll be like, Mom, you're watching AI videos. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5162.44s)]
*  And she goes, but it's cute. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5166.44s)]
*  And I have no answer to that. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5168.44s)]
*  Like she knows it's AI and I'm just scared. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5169.44s)]
*  I'm scared. When I see that, I get scared because I'm like, oh God, what if you believe this? [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5172.44s)]
*  You know, did you cover DarkWoke Blue and Oz new theory that JD Vance's serial child molester that was [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5176.44s)]
*  a scourge to Ohio Valley? [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5180.44s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I did. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5182.44s)]
*  That's Saturday. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5183.44s)]
*  Big reveal. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5184.44s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5185.44s)]
*  Andrew hashtag I am the resistance follows me, by the way. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5186.44s)]
*  Which is awesome. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5191.44s)]
*  I didn't know he followed me. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5196.44s)]
*  I didn't know. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5197.44s)]
*  Some someone so significant to blue and on sphere was following me. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5198.44s)]
*  He said, you changed your name three times because you kept getting caught raping children in the Ohio Valley. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5202.44s)]
*  And I have witnesses who can and will testify against you on this. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5206.44s)]
*  I cannot wait to put you in prison for the rest of your life. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5209.44s)]
*  You sick fuck. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5212.44s)]
*  And then he posted the Midas touch conservatives or pedophiles compilation, which I unironically do love this [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5214.44s)]
*  compilation. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5220.44s)]
*  It's very good. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5221.44s)]
*  And he said, this all starts to make sense when you zoom out and this at hashtag GOP Petoring. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5222.44s)]
*  Now I want to I want to I want to mention something. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5227.44s)]
*  Okay. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5230.44s)]
*  I want to mention something here. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5231.44s)]
*  This is good. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5232.44s)]
*  It's good. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5233.44s)]
*  It's blue and on engagement bait. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5234.44s)]
*  Libs are going crazy a little bit, but it's good that they're going crazy in the same way that Q and on went crazy where they're like, turns out all the fucking it's not the liberals that were all pedophiles is the conservatives. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5236.44s)]
*  They were all pedophiles, which by the way, there's a lot more evidence for prominent conservatives being pedophiles. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5249.44s)]
*  Let's be real as the Midas touch video shows. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5253.44s)]
*  But you know, I'm so happy this blew up, which is not something I would be saying if I was making it up. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5255.44s)]
*  That's not giving me a lot of confidence. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5260.44s)]
*  These people are fucking gross and I've been covering the track very well, but it's all a stack of cars is about to fall. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5263.44s)]
*  Please check out my most recent space where I talk about it. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5268.44s)]
*  It's pinned to the top of my page, but I'll link it here as well. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5270.44s)]
*  You guys understand that at this point, everything they accuse us is a confession of what they do with that in mind. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5272.44s)]
*  I present to you this Q and on thread. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5277.44s)]
*  Keep in mind what they claim Democrats are doing and what Trump will expose and bring down. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5279.44s)]
*  Oh my God, he flipped the script. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5284.44s)]
*  Oh my God, he literally is saying it's not Q and on. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5286.44s)]
*  It's blue and on. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5288.44s)]
*  I feel like I materialize this. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5290.44s)]
*  I like I joked a little bit too much about living on and Q and blue and on. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5292.44s)]
*  And now they're doing it. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5296.44s)]
*  They're like actually doing it. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5298.44s)]
*  It makes me kind of happy that Dark woke is real. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5300.44s)]
*  Fuck it. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5302.44s)]
*  Oh, they got their army of schizophrenics. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5304.44s)]
*  So do we, you know, that's like, you know, this is just what you got to do. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5306.44s)]
*  Sometimes I was about to break this news in parentheses tweet on Monday, but I was afraid to get cooked. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5310.44s)]
*  Good. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5315.44s)]
*  That's good. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5317.44s)]
*  So you're proving that it's good that I sometimes make fun of chatters who come to me with this information. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5319.44s)]
*  And that causes you to at the very least, like maintain a level of skepticism over shit that you see on your timeline that you want to bring to me. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5325.44s)]
*  Like, like a dog would bring a dead squirrel as a gift. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5334.44s)]
*  This is good. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5338.44s)]
*  Good that you know that to not do that. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5340.44s)]
*  Oh, man. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5342.44s)]
*  This is great. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5343.44s)]
*  W Hassan Ali collab. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5344.44s)]
*  Many people have been asking me how do I feel about being on Hassan's live stream? [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5346.44s)]
*  I mean, it was really cool. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5350.44s)]
*  It seemed like he wanted me on it. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5351.44s)]
*  Maybe it's just me. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5352.44s)]
*  He seemed a little nervous to come up to me, but it's really cool that us two influencers were able to collaborate like this. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5354.44s)]
*  Like, honestly, it was such an honor. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5361.44s)]
*  We're basically best friends now. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5362.44s)]
*  I love you. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5364.44s)]
*  Many people have been asked. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5365.44s)]
*  Yeah, I like this. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5366.44s)]
*  I fucking hate Tiktok desktop. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5367.44s)]
*  It's so ass. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5369.44s)]
*  I hope you bring receives because van seems like type of dude that will strike back in this. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5371.44s)]
*  He can sue me, but he won't because that would invite the process of discovery. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5375.44s)]
*  Isn't that right? [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5378.44s)]
*  JD Vance or do you prefer James Donald Bowman or James David Hamill? [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5379.44s)]
*  He got him fucking got him, dude. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5383.44s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5386.44s)]
*  On a fairly important outside of Israel and Palestine. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5388.44s)]
*  No. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5392.44s)]
*  What else are your major disagreements? [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5393.44s)]
*  I don't care about anything else in terms of like what his output is. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5395.44s)]
*  Like I I defended him for a year after our podcast ended. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5401.44s)]
*  And I was like, I don't care about what he's saying because people will constantly come in and try to make drama and be like, oh, he's saying this or that. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5406.44s)]
*  And I was like, look, I don't really care. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5413.44s)]
*  I don't like there's a genocide going on. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5415.44s)]
*  I care about that. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5417.44s)]
*  I care about covering that more than I care about what like, you know, Ethan is saying. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5418.44s)]
*  And it feels like somewhere along the way he just like lost it, you know, where he I mean, he made so much in what way though? [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5423.44s)]
*  Because I mean, he's in great shape now. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5431.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5434.44s)]
*  Ironically enough, he's changed his life. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5435.44s)]
*  Yeah. Ironically enough, he's supposed to be the happiest he's ever been. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5437.44s)]
*  But if you look at him, or at least when I see him on stream and whatnot, he just looks so unhappy in comparison to how much happier he was when he was fat. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5441.44s)]
*  And it's because he was eating good, bro. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5452.44s)]
*  Probably. That's probably part of what it is. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5455.44s)]
*  But I like I mean, he's he's tried to deplatform me multiple times. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5457.44s)]
*  Like he's talked about like suing me, suing random anonymous Redditors to get their information. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5463.44s)]
*  Stay off that. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5470.44s)]
*  Dude, that's what I said. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5471.44s)]
*  I was like, bro, just like, what are you doing? [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5472.44s)]
*  Like, why are you trying to do this? [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5475.44s)]
*  Especially because like, ironically enough, he stopped doing the podcast together because he was like, oh, I can't I can't do this podcasting on the politics front because people get very mad. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5476.44s)]
*  Sometimes they misconstrue what I'm saying. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5488.44s)]
*  Sometimes they have disagreements, you know, and people get really vicious. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5490.44s)]
*  And this space that I'm in is very vicious. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5493.44s)]
*  Politics is very vicious, especially on the progressive side. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5496.44s)]
*  And, you know, I feel like if he just like stuck to, you know, drama, comedy, Goose and Gats, like he probably would be in a way happier mental space. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5500.44s)]
*  But he just literally cannot stop talking about everyone that's pro-Palestine. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5509.44s)]
*  And it's interesting because there are people out there who say that they're pro-Palestine. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5517.44s)]
*  But let's be real. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5523.44s)]
*  They hate Jews. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5524.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5525.44s)]
*  Like there are a lot. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5526.44s)]
*  Hey, listen, you're there. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5527.44s)]
*  Get popping again on if your engagements down start hating on the Jews. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5528.44s)]
*  And, oh, for sure. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5532.44s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5533.44s)]
*  And there's like there are very prominent people who do this. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5534.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5537.44s)]
*  So for him to like constantly come after me when his nose, I'm not anti-semitic and making these inferences that I am and like partnering with like the ADL and think that he maybe looked at your relationship as a friendship to. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5538.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5554.44s)]
*  Maybe he thinks that you're not looking at his perspective. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5555.44s)]
*  No, I think I think that's that's precisely that that plays a big role in it for sure. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5558.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5563.44s)]
*  But I think it's also a little bit of narcissism. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5564.44s)]
*  We're all narcissists to a certain degree. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5566.44s)]
*  We're on camera. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5568.44s)]
*  We want to be like we want to. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5569.44s)]
*  So we didn't push back against your anti-semitism. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5570.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5572.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5573.44s)]
*  He's compromised. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5574.44s)]
*  We want to have our opinions validated. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5575.44s)]
*  And I feel like there was a there was a disconnect with his own audience that he had cultivated. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5577.44s)]
*  Many progressive people that were like, seems like you're maybe defensive over Israel a little bit. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5582.44s)]
*  And then he was like, oh, you're saying that because I'm a Jewish person like and no, lo and behold. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5589.44s)]
*  I mean, I will say this. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5594.44s)]
*  There is a lot of hate out there. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5595.44s)]
*  No, for sure. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5597.44s)]
*  This is something I actually despise about this entire industry is you don't think you could ever just reach out to him off camera and just give him a phone call. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5598.44s)]
*  By the way, he said that he never said that you are anti-semitic, but you spread propaganda around anti-semitism. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5605.44s)]
*  Lamau dog, he's literally called me a fucking terrorist supporter and an anti-semite numerous times. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5611.44s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5616.44s)]
*  And be like, hey, bro, like, I don't know what's going on. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5618.44s)]
*  We can't. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5621.44s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5622.44s)]
*  That's what I'm saying, because like the last text message I sent him literally was like after he had done these like call outposts being like you love terrorists like this. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5623.44s)]
*  Come on, dude. He was talking to a civil litigator like an injury lawyer the other day and he's like, can we get this guy? [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5631.44s)]
*  Can we get this guy charged with like domestic terrorism? [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5638.44s)]
*  And like on the one hand, he's joking. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5641.44s)]
*  But on the other hand, dudes are getting kidnapped off the street by ICE agents for literally doing anti-Israel protests. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5643.44s)]
*  They, the crew told Eden never say never waste. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5652.44s)]
*  He played the semantics card. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5655.44s)]
*  He literally said, I shouldn't completely forget the next day. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5657.44s)]
*  I think he just has a unlimited faucet of calling whoever he is branded an enemy virtually every fucking virtually every smear under the sun. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5659.44s)]
*  His sub says they want to deport you to El Salvador. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5671.44s)]
*  Please send me that link. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5674.44s)]
*  That's really funny. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5676.44s)]
*  There ain't no fucking way. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5677.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5678.44s)]
*  He said that and then he unpaused the video from I dubs and in the video I showed him a clip of you calling him. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5679.44s)]
*  No. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5684.44s)]
*  Okay. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5685.44s)]
*  Send me the link to this. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5686.44s)]
*  I got to see this. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5687.44s)]
*  He said that and then he unpaused the video from items and then the video item showed a clip of him calling you an anti-Semite. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5688.44s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5693.44s)]
*  Dude, what are we doing? [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5694.44s)]
*  He's like a 40 year old man with multiple children. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5695.44s)]
*  That is just the most childish person you ever met. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5698.44s)]
*  Like no self-control, no self-restraint whatsoever. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5702.44s)]
*  Well, because he's rich, he's like surrounded by other adults who constantly have to fucking nanny him. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5705.44s)]
*  I am an Islamist fundamentalist radical terrorist. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5710.44s)]
*  That's not what I accused you of. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5715.44s)]
*  But go on. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5717.44s)]
*  Keep straw manning what I said. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5718.44s)]
*  Co-signed by Ian. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5720.44s)]
*  I am a vicious anti-Semite. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5722.44s)]
*  It's true. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5724.44s)]
*  Most of them call you a vicious anti-Semite. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5725.44s)]
*  Well, I'll never say never. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5728.44s)]
*  Well, I think he's I think he's I think he's that you definitely called him an anti-Semite many times. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5730.44s)]
*  Vicious is different. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5734.44s)]
*  I think. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5735.44s)]
*  Yo! [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5736.44s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5737.44s)]
*  You're on fucking crack cocaine if you can get away with saying that. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5739.44s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5744.44s)]
*  I think he propagates anti-Semitism. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5745.44s)]
*  I don't think he does it intentionally. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5748.44s)]
*  I'm just saying. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5749.44s)]
*  I think you said raging. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5750.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5752.44s)]
*  Raging. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5753.44s)]
*  I don't remember. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5754.44s)]
*  You maybe even never used vicious specifically. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5755.44s)]
*  I don't think I've ever said like I don't think he consciously hates Jewish people. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5756.44s)]
*  I think he propagates anti-Semitism. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5760.44s)]
*  I don't even but I mean I could be wrong. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5764.44s)]
*  I don't think I don't think I am. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5766.44s)]
*  Doesn't really end up that'll end up being the next clip that plays. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5768.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5771.44s)]
*  I mean it doesn't really matter either way. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5772.44s)]
*  I'm just saying just never say never. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5774.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5777.44s)]
*  Oh, it doesn't matter. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5778.44s)]
*  Importantly, Ethan is more attractive than me both physically and also mentally. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5779.44s)]
*  I've been. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5783.44s)]
*  Why? [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5784.44s)]
*  What? [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5785.44s)]
*  Are we actually doing this frat bro thing? [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5786.44s)]
*  This is the fucking cutting. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5788.44s)]
*  This is the cutting. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5789.44s)]
*  Dude, he's so he just one backtracked on the numerous times he's actually called me anti-Semitic [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5790.44s)]
*  recognizing that it's a fucking false statement in this very moment when he's getting called [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5795.44s)]
*  out for it then went what are we doing this rap shit dude. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5799.44s)]
*  Ethan Klein loves talking about people's looks. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5802.44s)]
*  That's like his number one thing that he loves to do. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5805.44s)]
*  He calls everybody ugly and fat all the time and like in the most mean girl way. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5808.44s)]
*  He calls everybody ugly and fat all the time and like in the most mean girls way possible [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5814.44s)]
*  and I can't fucking shit on him too much for that. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5819.44s)]
*  I do it too. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5822.44s)]
*  Sometimes, you know, I call I call a succulent porky looking cop a pig, you know, I'll fat [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5823.44s)]
*  shame a fat cop sometimes, you know, I've done my fair share of this or when Margarubio's [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5830.44s)]
*  earlobes fucking have their own gravitational pull, right? [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5836.44s)]
*  I said that. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5840.44s)]
*  However, the reason why I specifically said Ethan, you are more handsome than me both [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5841.44s)]
*  mentally and physically is a joke, which is again, I know for Ethan that's weird because [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5845.44s)]
*  he thinks a joke is when he someone is a pedophile or like a neo-nazi. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5852.44s)]
*  That's what he thinks a joke is when he goes on like a vicious smear campaign. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5856.44s)]
*  That's the only thing that he thinks is a joke. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5862.44s)]
*  Everything else is like, I don't understand. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5864.44s)]
*  But the reason why I made that joke is because he constantly talks about the way I look is [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5866.44s)]
*  weird as fuck. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5871.44s)]
*  Why you lie to Ethan Law? [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5872.44s)]
*  That's why that's the joke. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5874.44s)]
*  The joke is Ethan is right about every fucking statement he's made. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5876.44s)]
*  Being edge criticism that has songs hotter than me. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5880.44s)]
*  Are we actually doing this? [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5887.44s)]
*  Ethan is more attractive than me both physically and also mentally. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5888.44s)]
*  I've been what you can say you're smarter than me. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5893.44s)]
*  I don't care about that. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5896.44s)]
*  But like, why are you doing the like, I'm hot and you're not like, what is this? [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5897.44s)]
*  I don't think he is this. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5903.44s)]
*  Holy shit, bro. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5907.44s)]
*  By the way, he still hasn't watched the content. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5910.44s)]
*  I guarantee it. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5912.44s)]
*  By the way, he still hasn't watched the content. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5914.44s)]
*  I guarantee it. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5916.44s)]
*  The content puke. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5917.44s)]
*  I've been lying about everything, including my glasses. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5919.44s)]
*  They're fake. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5922.44s)]
*  He was right about that. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5923.44s)]
*  That's not even in the content nuke. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5924.44s)]
*  And he was right about that too. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5926.44s)]
*  How did he know? [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5927.44s)]
*  OK. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5928.44s)]
*  There you go. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5929.44s)]
*  You even fucking debunked. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5930.44s)]
*  I think he's referencing the post of him in the tub because in that post you talked about his glasses. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5931.44s)]
*  I was wondering if that's what he's. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5937.44s)]
*  I think he told me at one point. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5938.44s)]
*  I mean, he might have both. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5940.44s)]
*  But no, I actually I'm 100% sure that I told him that my glasses were fake. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5942.44s)]
*  Bro, what is this man doing? [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5949.44s)]
*  Dude, please, please just stop lying for like one second, dude. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5954.44s)]
*  There's no fucking way. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5961.44s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5964.44s)]
*  Oh my God, dude. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5966.44s)]
*  One time he came on Leftovers and he was wearing on prescription glasses. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5970.44s)]
*  That's 100%. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5975.44s)]
*  So I mean, like he probably he might have both or maybe his vision. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5976.44s)]
*  I just remember the last episode. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5979.44s)]
*  I remember the last episode he said he didn't have his on him. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5981.44s)]
*  Maybe that's what you're referring to. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5985.44s)]
*  He said he couldn't see the screen the last episode. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5988.44s)]
*  No, I'm not referring to that. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5991.44s)]
*  I'm referring to something else. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5993.44s)]
*  But I mean, fine. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5994.44s)]
*  You got me on the glasses thing. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5996.44s)]
*  Fucking owned, I guess. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5997.44s)]
*  Everything how? [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=5999.44s)]
*  Wake up, Ethan. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=6002.44s)]

*  Ethan, wake up. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=6008.44s)]
*  This is this intro goes kind of hard. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=6010.44s)]
*  I'm not going to lie, especially when the music kicks in like this. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=6013.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=6017.44s)]
*  Maybe I'm crazy, but I did. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=6019.44s)]
*  I felt like this intro like Ian cooked on this. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=6020.44s)]
*  This is the way he is in a corny. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=6024.44s)]
*  But this part is way up for what? [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=6027.44s)]
*  I cannot believe what I'm saying. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=6031.44s)]
*  This is all. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=6037.44s)]

*  I need to be away. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=6042.44s)]
*  Did you tell him to say he's hotter than me? [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=6044.44s)]
*  Was that your line? [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=6046.44s)]
*  I think it probably was. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=6047.44s)]
*  Okay. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=6050.44s)]

*  All right. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVMzPslyGuQ&t=6076.44s)]
