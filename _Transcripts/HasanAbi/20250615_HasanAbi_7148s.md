# Netanyahu’s Desperate Lie About Iran Targeting Trump | HasanAbi Archive
**HasanAbi:** [June 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU)
*  Trump came in and was like, nope, we're chopping that up immediately. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=0.0s)]
*  And that was the goal. Benjamin and Yahoo hated that shit. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4.0s)]
*  That was definitely, that was definitely an instance where like Israel's demands were not met entirely. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=7.2s)]
*  Right? Because I think the American government, the American foreign policy approach was different. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=15.4s)]
*  Whereas, whereas Trump was in... [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=19.8s)]
*  Anyway, BB is on, BB is on Fox news, begging for attention. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=30.2s)]
*  Nanyahu tells MagaBase Iran tried to kill Trump twice on Fox news. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=37.0s)]
*  Nanyahu claimed Israeli intelligence suggests Iran plotted to assassinate Trump, calling him enemy number one. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=40.6s)]
*  The Israeli prime minister was appealing to Trump's base, hoping to rally US public support for joining its unprovoked war with Iran. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=44.6s)]
*  No evidence was claimed. No evidence was provided for the claim and Iran has repeatedly denied targeting Trump. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=50.0s)]
*  I want to talk about the threat. I want to talk about president Trump. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=55.6s)]
*  You just said, uh, Iran tried to assassinate president Trump twice. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=57.8s)]
*  Do you have intel that the assassination attempts on president Trump were direct? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=62.4s)]
*  Yes, but we will not show you. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=66.0s)]
*  If you ask me for, if you ask me for evidence, you might be anti-Semitic, Brett. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=68.8s)]
*  I hate to say it. I hate to call you an anti-Semite, Brett. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=74.6s)]
*  But do not ask me. Do not ask me, Brett. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=79.7s)]
*  Don't do it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=87.2s)]
*  Directly from Iran? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=88.2s)]
*  Through proxies, yes. Through their intel, yes. They want to kill him. Look, he's enemy number one. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=90.2s)]
*  He's a decisive leader. He never took the path that others took to try to bargain with him in a way that is weak, giving them basically a pathway to rich uranium, which means a pathway to the bull, padding it with billions and billions of dollars. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=97.2s)]
*  He took up this fake agreement and basically tore it up. He killed the Qassem Suleiman. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=113.2s)]
*  Yeah, that was a great move, man. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=119.0s)]
*  I like that he's basically presenting all of Trump's major mistakes, chopping up the Iran agreement being perhaps the worst one. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=121.2s)]
*  Okay, that I think for the record is like one of the few instances where I will say that there wasn't a uniparty approach. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=131.1s)]
*  That was Donald Trump leaning into the Israel lobby's demands as opposed to Barack Obama not doing that and saying we're going to pave a different path. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=144.1s)]
*  America wants to destroy Iran, decapitate its leadership and create destabilization in Iran for sure. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=155.4s)]
*  But I think the previous administration's assessment on that front was basically to ease up on Iran a little bit to allow them to carve a different path forward potentially. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=164.4s)]
*  And that path forward was through sanctions and then coupled with the agreement. Trump came in and was like, nope, we're chopping that up immediately. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=177.4s)]
*  And that was the goal. Benjamin and Yahoo hated that shit. That was definitely that was definitely an instance where like Israel's demands were not met entirely. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=185.4s)]
*  Right. Because I think the American government, the American foreign policy approach was different. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=197.4s)]
*  Whereas, whereas Trump was in lockstep, this was a big mistake. This was a major mistake. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=202.4s)]
*  But ever since then, especially with Biden, who is an ultra Zionist, they have not straight away from the uniparty. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=211.4s)]
*  Israel gives us the notes like we use Israeli intelligence and Israeli assessment in the region. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=222.4s)]
*  They haven't they haven't moved away from that even a little bit since then with both Biden and also with Donald Trump. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=229.4s)]
*  Now, this is ironically enough why I say like Kamala Harris would not have been different than Donald Trump in terms of her approach heard to Israel Palestine, which really triggers lives like liberals get so mad when I say that they're like, how dare you with Kamala Harris would be going. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=237.4s)]
*  We'd be going out to brunch right now. It's like, yeah, you would because you wouldn't give a shit about all the awful things that they would also be doing. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=254.4s)]
*  And that's not just my assessment, because like I remember I criticized this protest, this this this poster and people got really mad people gotten their feelings about it. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=262.4s)]
*  But like Kamala Harris's own advisors, like her own NSC person who would have been in the in the Security Council, like she came out and said, we'd be defending Israel harder than Trump if given the opportunity. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=273.4s)]
*  And I don't know why liberals would rather deny that and close their eyes to that reality that they've diluted themselves in the thinking that Kamala Harris would have a different foreign policy approach than the Trump administration. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=287.4s)]
*  When members of her campaign and her cabinet have actively been saying that we would outflank Donald Trump on our defense of Israel. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=302.4s)]
*  Here's Omar Moussa still thinking about the concerted campaign by people from my own community who said Harris administration would be the exact same as the Trump administration plays stupid games wins to surprise. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=315.4s)]
*  The great point, Amar, because Harris campaign on ending the in Gaza and reigning Israeli biblical irredentism, right? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=324.4s)]
*  The tedious would Harris have been substantially different on Israel Twitter debate can easily be solved in a matter of minutes by Harris herself, who can whenever she wants denounces Trump's brutal side and escalation with Iran. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=330.4s)]
*  Weirdly, Harris has never done this. This is exactly my point. I bring this up all the time. She's not running for office right now. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=340.4s)]
*  She's not running for office right now. Why hasn't she said anything if she's actually this like brave anti-jab side? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=348.4s)]
*  She has this like brave anti position where she at. It's so strange that people are like, no, you don't understand. She actually is secretly anti-jab side. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=354.4s)]
*  She's just on the sidelines. She's just, you know, keeping her peace. It's so stupid here. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=364.4s)]
*  Senator Adam Schiff, I call him Adam shit is from earlier today. They're doing meet the press Democrats are doing meet the press saying I think Israel's right to defend itself. And I support what Israel's doing to defend itself in terms of whatever the whether the administration should go further and engage in direct hostilities against Iran. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=371.4s)]
*  That's not something I support. Well, don't worry. We are already supporting Iran. I mean, Israel and we will continue supporting Israel. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=386.4s)]
*  And we will most likely also offer military capabilities to Israel to strike Iran. Don't worry. That's also coming. And when that happens, Adam Schiff will be like, well, you know, I normally don't agree with much. I normally don't agree with what much with the Trump administration. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=395.4s)]
*  But on this one, they're a okay. Okay. Understand American foreign policy is uniparty Democrats have basically shown that this is the reality. I am so confused as to why people within the base act as though the Democrats are not lockstep on this issue. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=412.4s)]
*  They are Trump. And his narrative is different. He doesn't he doesn't try to even keep up with the presence that there's like, or the the the fake notion that there is some kind of international laws that we are following here that we're abiding by. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=434.4s)]
*  Okay. They Trump just doesn't do that. He will just straight up be like, Nope. What the are you going to do about it? Don't you want foreign policy to be uniparty though? What? No, I don't. What are you talking about? No, I want an actual anti war Democratic Party being pro war and trying to outflank the Republicans on American military actions is unironically allowing dipshits like Donald Trump to make it seem as though because it would change every four years. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=454.4s)]
*  I want American foreign policy to be anti war. I don't give a if it's uniparty in that front. Okay. What do you mean? What do you mean? You're saying both parties want war and more war isn't that great? Otherwise, it would be too unstable. Like what are you talking about? Even if it was unstable in one party would come back into power and reign it back in every four years, I would still prefer that over both parties being pro war all the time. God damn is so stupid. It's bad policy and it's bad politics. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=484.4s)]
*  Like every prominent Democrat has basically offered support. I've been long committed to ensuring Iran doesn't have a weapon. We must work with Israel and our regional partners. It's like, bro, you are a senator from Minnesota. What are you talking about? You're like, I have been long committed as a senator from Minnesota that Iran cannot have a weapon. We have to blow up Iran. We must work with Israel and our regional partners to deescalate and avoid a devastating regional war. That is the way to keep people safe, including the thousands of US service members stationed in the Middle East. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=514.4s)]
*  Yeah. I have a really good suggestion of how we can keep him safe. Get him out of the Middle East. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=544.4s)]
*  He said, made it very clear, including now you cannot have a weapon, which means you cannot enrich. He's been very forceful. So for them, he's a, he's an enemy. Number one. Look, they also tried to kill me, but I'm his junior partner. When they understand that president Trump is a great threat to Iran's plans to bro. You look like shit. Big dog. What's happening? You look like you haven't slept. Oh well. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=549.1999999999999s)]
*  I mean, I'm not going to let them do that. I'm not going to let them do that. I'm not going to let them do that. I'm not going to let them do that. I'm not going to let them do that. I'm not going to let them do that. I'm not going to let them do that. I'm not going to let them do that. I'm not going to let them do that. I'm not going to let them do that. I'm not going to let them do that. I'm not going to let them do that. I'm not going to let them do that. I'm not going to let them do that. I'm not going to let them do that. I'm not going to let them do that. I'm not going to let them do that. I'm not going to let them do that. I'm not going to let them do that. I'm not going to let them do that. I'm not going to let them do that. I'm not going to let them do [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=573.2s)]
*  it. So you were closely coordinating with the U.S. throughout this process. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=603.2s)]
*  Look, we're fully coordinated, but understand that America, under President Trump, will make the decisions that are best for America. And that's the way it is. He understands that I, as the Prime Minister of Israel, the one and only Jewish state, must make the decisions that are important for the survivor, and he will do what is best for America. That is a relationship of mutual respect and mutual confidence. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=607.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think, I think one of the things that Iran tried to do, and I covered it at the time, and it was almost silly of them to assume that Israel would back away from this was to put out a leak, like a little bit of the leak of the treasure trove of data that they had taken from Israel. Right. Like an incredible data leak, an incredible data breach. One piece that they brought up was Israel's quid pro quo. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=631.2s)]
*  One piece that they brought up was Israel's coordination with the IA, like the International Atomic Agency, basically. I don't know what the fucking actual name of it is. I'm going to tell you right now here. It's the IAIE. No, not IAIE. IAEA, the International Atomic Energy Agency. Sorry, I get a little dyslexic. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=659.2s)]
*  And the International Atomic Energy Agency is the intergovernmental organization that seeks to promote the peaceful use of energy and to inhibit its use for any military purpose, including weapons. And they, Iran released information that, that they presented after their big data leak, after the Israeli data leak, the data breach that suggested that like there was some cooperation with Israeli intelligence. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=686.2s)]
*  Hold on one second. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=716.2s)]
*  One second. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=728.2s)]
*  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=737.2s)]
*  Do you see the New York Times, David French op-ed that basically explains the Hassan policy? No, it's not. You don't understand the nukes are hidden in the mountains and underground. Like WNNs in Iraq were. Yeah. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=745.2s)]
*  It's one. It's incredibly frustrating to, to, to watch this song and dance play out as Israel continues to escalate. Israel is doing decapitation strikes on academics. Israel in Iran. Israel is basically treating Iran like Gaza. At this point, Israel gets to treat every country like Gaza. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=761.2s)]
*  And it's, it's the, the breakdown of international law is even more severe than the ethnic claim campaign that Israel is committed to in the Gaza Strip, which it has almost impunity over. It has as a belligerent occupier, tremendous control over. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=783.2s)]
*  When you do that to another sovereign nation, a regional power that is outside of the sphere of American influence, what you're, what you're suggesting is like it's no hold, no holds barred. Right? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=805.2s)]
*  And the very fact that people are talking about like, is America going to get into this conflict? America already is very meaningfully involved in this conflict, both with its defensive weapons that they're giving to Israel, but with also the offensive means that we have already given to Israel that they're using on Iran. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=817.2s)]
*  But we also are offering intelligence and our, our, our military presence in the region is supposed to be an effective deterrence against people that might against people that don't like what Israel is doing. Right. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=839.2s)]
*  And the very fact that they just go back and forth on whether or not America should be involved in this, it makes me feel as though America is going to get even more involved in this. Hold on. Like more involved than it has been so far in terms of, in terms of obviously giving munitions. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=857.2s)]
*  And now Trump is already saying it to Rachel Scott, senior course, senior political correspondent for the white house for ABC spoke with president Trump briefly this morning. They're going to get involved. We are going to get involved. Like we are already involved, but we're going to get more involved is what I mean. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=881.2s)]
*  We're going to start striking Iran. And, and if that is an inevitability, I don't understand how Iran's assessment on the matter has not changed in terms of like demonstrating restraint. Okay. It's very clear that they're trying to apply the Dehia doctrine on Iran. Channel 14. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=895.2s)]
*  For those of you who don't know the Dehia doctrine is Israel's death and destruction campaign. It's what America applied in the Korean war. It's basically universalizing the damage by effectively destroying. It's like doing like a lighter version of an ethnic cleansing by directly targeting civilian centers and destroying all civil life in an area. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=914.2s)]
*  It's like pure exterminationist. And the goal there is to punish the entire population. Hold on. Yeah. I do think the U S is soon going to be directly involved in the mass bombing campaign of Iran. I think that that is what they're tailoring this entire conversation around. And that's the reason why you're seeing op-ed pieces like this. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=940.2s)]
*  Iran's target isn't just Israel. It's us. Israel's strike against Iran isn't just self-defense is the frontline of a broader clash of freedom versus tyranny. Now this kind of this kind of, of think piece, it doesn't have the same motion that it once had. There is no appetite for waging war with Iran. There's no appetite in America for waging war with Iran. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=960.2s)]
*  Now that might change if there's like a 9-11 style attack that they can point to and say Iran did this and then Americans might actually rally around the flag and go gung-ho. But ultimately without that. And even with that, I don't even know if there would be the same level of support, the same level of support for Iran. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=981.2s)]
*  Like going to war with Iran as they, as they were able to whip up for a post 9-11 going into Afghanistan and also Iraq. I think that I, I think that it's a, it's here. I think that this is the final stage of the, the Israeli and American joint conquest in the region. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1007.2s)]
*  Iran is the final player. You're dumb. Why? No, don't ban that person. I, maybe they have a good point. Who knows? Maybe they're seeing something that I'm not seeing so far. My assessment has held up. My analysis has been fairly, I mean, it's been pretty correct as opposed to like the overwhelming majority. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1028.2s)]
*  Even, even have people who are pro-Palestine, like their, their assessment of like Trump being more restrained as a figure than Kamala Harris would potentially be or, or the Joe Biden camp that came before it was, was incorrect. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1045.2s)]
*  And the, the simple reason for why my assessment comes out on the, on the correct side, as opposed to everyone else's is because I understand that America and Israel are lockstep and they, they were getting hate rated boss. Oh, we are from where I, I'm telling you right now. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1059.2s)]
*  I'm telling you right now, I think, I think what is, what is, what is taking place is, is America's America's continuation of the, the final act in rebuilding this, this entire region in its own vision. That's where we're at. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1076.2s)]
*  Moin Robani says various reports suggested the United States is debating direct participation in Israel's war against Iran. In addition to the massive supply of arms and funds, it's Israeli proxy, the mobilization of anti-missile defenses to protect it from Iranian retaliation and the provision of diplomatic and political support. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1100.2s)]
*  This would mean that U S forces would become directly involved in attacking Iranian territory and assets. How do we get here? Since Israel launched this war of aggression in Iran, various theories have been floated about the role of the US. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1114.2s)]
*  One popular interpretation is that the Trump administration's very different approach to Iran relative to that during its first term was all a ruse. A joint US Israeli decision to attack Iran was perfectly made from the very outset and the negotiations were convened in order to lull Tehran into a false sense of security and were never meant to be serious. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1124.2s)]
*  In other words, everything went as exactly as planned. This strikes me as excessively simplistic. When the second Trump administration assumed office, the failure of his previous approach was visibly apparent. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1141.2s)]
*  Is 2018 reunification of the joint comprehensive plan of action, better known as the Iran nuclear agreement enabled Iran to become a nuclear threshold state with possession of a nuclear weapon, essentially just one political decision away. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1149.2s)]
*  While the policy of maximum pressure that replaced the JCPOA had produced a permanent and growing economic crisis in Iran and contributed to anti-government sentiment and protest, they affected neither the coherence and political will of the Iranian leadership nor significantly weakened its grip over the country. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1161.2s)]
*  Given Iran status as a nuclear threshold state and a significant technological advances it had made in response to the US's 2018 repudiation of the JCPOA and Washington's commitment to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons by any means necessary. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1175.2s)]
*  This left the Trump administration with only two options and little time to choose between them. Negotiate an agreement with Tehran to ensure it does not and cannot acquire a nuclear weapon or go to war to achieve this result before key JCPOA provisions expire in October 2025. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1188.2s)]
*  The latter date is important because it presents the final opportunity for the JCPOA's European signatories to reimpose international sanctions on Iran without the need for Russian or Chinese consent. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1202.2s)]
*  Back in Washington, the new administration was internally divided on how to deal with Iran. Key officials including the Natsik advisor Mike Waltz, CENTCOM commander Michael Corilla and Trump acolytes like Senator Lindsey Graham wanted to attack Iran as soon and as hard as possible, preferably immediately after Trump's 20th January inauguration ceremonies concluded. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1212.2s)]
*  Others recognizing the anti-interventionist forces now constitute an important growing Republican constituency were keen to avoid yet another economically costly unpopular and bloody forever war in the Middle East. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1231.2s)]
*  Specialists who examined the matter additionally concluded that Iran's nuclear program could no longer be destroyed by air power alone and that a successful effort would ultimately require regime change in 10 years, which could well make Iraq look like a cakewalk. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1241.2s)]
*  The neocons are confidently predicted about the previous self-inflicted debacle. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1253.2s)]
*  As for Trump, who was seen as instinctively well disposed towards Israel against Iran, but also to have an aversion to initiating wars, he clearly lacks the ideological fervor of a Joe Biden. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1258.2s)]
*  I don't think this matters. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1268.2s)]
*  Especially when it comes to Iran, I don't think this matters. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1271.2s)]
*  I think ultimately, I think ultimately the decision was made a long time ago and all of the back and forth, oh, we're negotiating with Iran. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1273.2s)]
*  All that stuff was just smoke and mirrors, cloak and daggers, whatever you want to call it. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1284.2s)]
*  It was just bullshit. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1291.2s)]
*  And I'm pretty sure Iran was aware that it was bullshit. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1293.2s)]
*  But the difference here is that Iran has always been endlessly restrained as opposed to the way Israel carries itself in the region. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1296.2s)]
*  There is no comparison between Israel and Iran. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1307.2s)]
*  Ironically enough, a lot of people say a lot of people will sit there and say, like, oh, Israel is the best. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1309.2s)]
*  Israel is the most moral nation. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1316.2s)]
*  Iran is so fucked up. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1318.2s)]
*  I mean, look at the way they treat women. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1319.2s)]
*  Look at the way that they treat gay people. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1320.2s)]
*  Blah, blah, blah. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1322.2s)]
*  Yes, Iran is a authoritarian in terms of its domestic policies. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1323.2s)]
*  OK, this, ironically enough, is also a national security threat to Iran. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1327.2s)]
*  OK, having said that, however, that paired up with the crippling sanctions regime that has created so much economic volatility and the distrust that a lot of people have, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1333.2s)]
*  especially secular people have in Iran against the Iranian government is not alone enough to create regime change in Iran. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1345.2s)]
*  And therefore, they have to directly go to war. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1357.2s)]
*  They have to directly start doing decapitation strikes, which they are going to. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1361.2s)]
*  They have already started. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1366.2s)]
*  They did it with IRGC first. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1367.2s)]
*  They did it with the nuclear scientists. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1369.2s)]
*  But they are inevitably going to try to assassinate and most likely successfully assassinate heads of state. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1371.2s)]
*  Iran knows this and has still refused either because they do not have the power to do so or because they are worried about the repercussions to civilian life, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1376.2s)]
*  have not responded to Israel in kind, even though Israel itself has shown every other country in the region that they only back away when met with even force. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1388.2s)]
*  When penalized through force, that's the only time where they back away when their military campaign ends because too many troops have died. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1400.2s)]
*  There's too much instability at home and they're not winning any favors. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1409.2s)]
*  They're not winning the war. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1414.2s)]
*  They're not winning the hearts and minds of the people back home who want their family members to come back from raiding the closets of, I don't know, like Lebanese people who they have displaced or slaughtered. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1415.2s)]
*  There was a report that Trump vetoed an assassination attempt on Khomeini. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1427.2s)]
*  Come in a what do you think? [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1432.2s)]
*  I think it's all the back and forth like, oh, we're vetoing this. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1435.2s)]
*  Oh, we're doing this. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1439.2s)]
*  It's all bullshit. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1440.2s)]
*  I think it's to instill a false sense of security in Iran. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1441.2s)]
*  I don't know if they will eat debate, but what is the potential off ramp? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1447.2s)]
*  I read that Khomeini is pissed off at Hassan Rouhani, who was a reformist Iranian president that negotiated the JCPOA for being foolish enough to negotiate with America. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1453.2s)]
*  Is a second JCPOA even possible right now? [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1461.2s)]
*  Have we crossed the event horizon for a conflict with Iran? [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1464.2s)]
*  We have absolutely crossed the event horizon with a conflict in Iran. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1466.2s)]
*  We are in a conflict with Iran already. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1469.2s)]
*  It is Iraq 2.0 happening, unfolding every single day in real time. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1472.2s)]
*  The only difference here is that unlike Iraq, Iran is a much larger country, has much better military capabilities, and has also seen the aftermath of Iraq and has basically spent the last three decades almost, but especially the last two decades building up their defenses, building up their command structure against what is currently taking place. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1477.2s)]
*  And the same goes for Israel as well. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1501.2s)]
*  Israel has been building up its military and its capabilities directly to do exactly this. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1503.2s)]
*  And it's finally here. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1508.2s)]
*  This is something that the neo-cons have been salivating about for decades. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1510.2s)]
*  They've been salivating about this prospect since like the late 90s, I would say, and it's finally happening. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1516.2s)]
*  I think this back and forth, this tit for tat is only going to escalate, and I think America is going to get involved in it, but I hope I'm wrong about that. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1524.2s)]
*  I have yet to be wrong in this analysis. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1534.2s)]
*  I really, really hope that I'm wrong in my analysis, but I think eventually they're going to do a decapitation strike. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1537.2s)]
*  Iran is going to respond either this week or even before the decapitation strike or after the decapitation strike with an even force that Israel has actually put forth thus far. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1545.2s)]
*  And in the process, America is going to get involved and be like, oh, well, we had no other reason. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1557.2s)]
*  We couldn't do anything. We had to get involved. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1562.2s)]
*  Iran sees this as an existential fight. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1565.2s)]
*  Israel's campaign aims to destabilize an entire state and country, not just this government. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1567.2s)]
*  Iran's only forcing the U.S. to choose between a major Middle East war or restraining Israel. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1571.2s)]
*  Yeah, this is Sina Tusi, senior fellow at CI Policy, and they're right. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1577.2s)]
*  Like in this, I am in favor of de-escalation across the board. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1582.2s)]
*  This is the only instance, this is one of the only fucking instances where like, this is one of the only instances where out of an interest of self-preservation, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1587.2s)]
*  they literally have to ramp it up to the same degree, to the same level that Israel has ramped it up to. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1597.2s)]
*  Zero knowledge of geopolitics. Is anyone likely to back Iran? [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1604.2s)]
*  No, no one is back in Iran, Russia and China. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1608.2s)]
*  And that's it. And Russia's got their hands busy. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1611.2s)]
*  China is aggressively non-interventionist. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1614.2s)]
*  They're keeping a close watch on it, obviously, because like they rely on Iranian oil. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1617.2s)]
*  They don't want Iran to light up the oil refineries in the region though, because they're getting oil from the other regional actors as well. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1621.2s)]
*  India? You think India would join on the side of Iran? Are you crazy? [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1628.2s)]
*  How are we so sure that Iran doesn't already have nuclear weapons? [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1633.2s)]
*  Because if Iran had nuclear weapons already, Israel would not be able to fucking attack them like this. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1637.2s)]
*  That's it. That's the whole point of a nuclear weapon. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1642.2s)]
*  Look at what happened between Pakistan and India. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1645.2s)]
*  I don't believe Pakistan would defend Iran either, for the record. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1647.2s)]
*  I don't know why people are saying Pakistan. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1650.2s)]
*  The entire purpose of building a nuclear program and having a nuclear arsenal is so that this, what is happening currently, does not happen. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1652.2s)]
*  That you don't get fucking bullied by regional superpowers that are working alongside the US and their imperial interests. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1659.2s)]
*  Russia, China and North Korea have taught the world that the only way to effectively deter US aggression is to develop nuclear weapons. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1669.2s)]
*  Designist propagandists remind us that Iran must do the same or risk winding up like Gaddafi's Libya. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1674.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1679.2s)]
*  Michael Orrin says on News Nation, the United States has four adversaries in the world, Russia, China, North Korea and Iran. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1680.2s)]
*  Three of them already have nuclear weapons. I don't think you want to have a fourth. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1685.2s)]
*  Like they're basically giving the fucking game away when they talk like this. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1688.2s)]
*  In Iran's arsenal can reach central Europe in a few years. They'll be able to reach the East coast of the United States. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1692.2s)]
*  United States has four adversaries in the world. They call it as Russia, China, North Korea and Iran. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1698.2s)]
*  Three of them have nuclear weapons already. I don't think you want to have a fourth. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1703.2s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1706.2s)]
*  They don't have one for the record. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1707.2s)]
*  They don't have one because the greatest proof that Iran does not have a nuclear weapon yet is this is what's happening right now. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1710.2s)]
*  Is the fact that Israel is just fucking blowing up Iran. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1717.2s)]
*  It's also the the greatest proof that they should have one because if they did, this would not be happening. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1719.2s)]
*  Merseymour offensive realism and Hassan Abedachin remain undisputed for sure. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1725.2s)]
*  Yossi Melman, Israeli intelligence reporter, Yossi Melman says the euphoria was short lived on Friday morning. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1729.2s)]
*  I asked whether it was even necessary to start a war, especially against the Iranians. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1735.2s)]
*  The Shiites are historically willing to suffer. I mentioned their willingness to sacrifice as they demonstrated in the eight years of attrition with Iraq. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1739.2s)]
*  I recommend that we cut our losses and turn to Trump to stop the man is with a reasonable agreement. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1746.2s)]
*  Otherwise, we will end up begging for a ceasefire and Iran will refuse. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1751.2s)]
*  That's also wrong. That's like the every part of this is wrong. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1754.2s)]
*  Oh, the Shiites are notorious for taking on self pain like it's an incredibly orientalist framework. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1758.2s)]
*  Hilarious coming from a dude who fucking lives in Israel. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1764.2s)]
*  Like how are you? It's just like this. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1768.2s)]
*  This to me shows how much Israel is like a Western superiority complex country. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1771.2s)]
*  Like how are you smack dab in the middle of the fucking region? [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1778.2s)]
*  And you still have these like idiotic assessments like all the the Iranian, the Shiite can take a tremendous amount of pain. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1781.2s)]
*  Like, OK, man, it's like you're talking about them like different type of being, you know. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1788.2s)]
*  And also this part of the assessment is also wrong. Trump to stop the man is with a reasonable agreement. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1793.2s)]
*  That's correct. Otherwise, we will end up begging for a ceasefire and Iran will refuse. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1797.2s)]
*  If Israel begged for a ceasefire with Iran, if you think Iran would refuse that ceasefire, you are fucking delusional. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1801.2s)]
*  Iran has only shown restraint, restraint that is self-defeating because what has it gotten? [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1808.2s)]
*  What has what has Iran gotten for demonstrating that restraint? [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1816.2s)]
*  Only more death and destruction. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1821.2s)]
*  Israel does not back away from a challenge unless they are fucking deterred with even force. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1823.2s)]
*  I don't like saying this. I don't think this is good. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1831.2s)]
*  I think this is a psychotic way to do diplomacy. It's not a diplomacy. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1836.2s)]
*  It's not a way to do diplomacy at all. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1841.2s)]
*  But Israel has shown time and time again with both Lebanon and on numerous other instances [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1843.2s)]
*  that they only back away when they realize that the person that they're dealing with is also willing to entertain an option that is evenly violent. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1849.2s)]
*  That's it. The truth the media will ignore is that the nuclear energy provides Iran a reprieve from the enslavement to IMF debt and Western Energy Corporation's independence and liberation from the great liberator. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1862.2s)]
*  What is this? This has to be Hassan Abiy has account. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1872.2s)]
*  This is a spot on. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1874.2s)]
*  Iran's moves are survival plays in a world where nukes equal sovereignty. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1904.2s)]
*  So it's like nukes for street cred? [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1908.2s)]
*  Exactly. It's mutually assured destruction. They're trying to make sure they're not the next Libya. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1910.2s)]
*  And what's wrong with bombing Libya? [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1915.2s)]
*  You destroy a sovereign state, loot it, then act shocked when others arm up to avoid your fate. That ain't democracy. That's gangster imperialism. No wonder you walk around in a shell. There's nothing left inside but greed and guilt. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1917.2s)]
*  Yeah, even the best Iranian rockets do not reach a single NATO country except Turkey and Greece. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1930.2s)]
*  I don't know if that's true. I think they have some longer range ones that can hit like Eastern Europe, but that's it. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1938.2s)]
*  But but even then, like they they're they're strike distance capabilities only reach the Gulf. They're only a threat to the Gulf Israel, you know. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1943.2s)]
*  But they are they're never like, yeah, you're right. It's the maximum distance is like fucking Turkey and Greece. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1955.2s)]
*  And America does not give a fuck about Turkey or Greece, obviously. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1962.2s)]
*  So let's be real. Why do they think preserving their resistance is the same thing as being non-human when they don't want to be destroyed or enslaved? [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1966.2s)]
*  Anyway, look, look, look, all I'm going to say is this. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1973.2s)]
*  Israel has never throughout his history shown anything but complete belligerence and instability and unlimited violence, knowing full welded. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1977.2s)]
*  All of those violent acts are going to be backed by the Western governments. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1988.2s)]
*  They're going to be funded by the Western governments to enact these violent acts. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1992.2s)]
*  And therefore, the only time where they ever pull back is when the American calculation for Israel out of Israel's self-preservation and continuation as a regional superpower as a regional power is is to scale it back a little bit. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=1995.2s)]
*  They only get to that point. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2008.2s)]
*  And America only tells them to stand down when either like there's too much instability because of the the instability that they're going to have. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2011.2s)]
*  And it's making it harder for people to defend Israel as they have done so in previous sieges or or when Israel is taking a fucking shellacking on the ground like in the like in the case in Lebanon and post October 7, it was no holds barred. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2021.2s)]
*  The bear hug strategy opened up the floodgates where America basically said we're a dying empire. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2033.2s)]
*  This is our last opportunity to fucking completely rebuild this vision, rebuild this region in our own vision so that we can pack this entire Middle Eastern region up and start to build a new empire. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2039.2s)]
*  That way you get to also have tremendous influence within OPEC plus as well. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2047.2s)]
*  And and then the last thing that they're going to do is they're going to have to build a new empire. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2050.2s)]
*  And that's going to be the first step in the process. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2053.2s)]
*  And that's going to be the first step in the process. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2056.2s)]
*  And that's going to be the first step in the process. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2059.2s)]
*  And that's going to be the first step in the process. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2062.2s)]
*  And that's going to be the first step in the process. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2065.2s)]
*  And that's going to be the first step in the process. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2068.2s)]
*  And that's going to be the first step in the process. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2071.2s)]
*  And that's going to be the first step in the process. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2074.2s)]
*  And that's going to be the first step in the process. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2077.2s)]
*  And that's going to be the first step in the process. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2080.2s)]
*  And that's going to be the first step in the process. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2083.2s)]
*  And that's going to be the first step in the process. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2086.2s)]
*  And that's going to be the first step in the process. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2089.2s)]
*  And that's going to be the first step in the process. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2092.2s)]
*  And that's going to be the first step in the process. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2095.2s)]
*  So, do we control American vassal states? [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2098.2s)]
*  Or do we completely align with China and then shut ourselves off from a bunch of different markets? [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2101.2s)]
*  In order to do that and to basically shut off the oil supply to China, [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2111.2s)]
*  you have to take out Iran from the equation. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2115.2s)]
*  Okay? [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2119.2s)]
*  What is this Golden Capa? Why are people saying Golden Capa? [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2121.2s)]
*  Oh, there's a Golden Capa train. Okay, that's why. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2124.2s)]

*  Like the only intervention here that could potentially cause people to reconsider [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2150.2s)]
*  what's going on is China. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2156.2s)]
*  And I don't think they give a fuck enough about like the trade that they have with Israel [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2158.2s)]
*  to not say anything here or to not do anything here [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2163.2s)]
*  because they're saying a lot of stuff, but words are meaningless in this process. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2166.2s)]
*  So I think the only way to approach this is with actions, [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2170.2s)]
*  giving protective cover to Iran, maybe even like military support to Iran, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2181.2s)]
*  political cover to Iran, which already exists from the Chinese side, [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2191.2s)]
*  and hoping that that, Ahsan, you are AT sympathizers. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2194.2s)]
*  Why are fucking right-wingers who come in here and say you are terrorist sympathizers? [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2202.2s)]
*  Like they can never fucking write. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2207.2s)]
*  It's such a sad state of affairs for education in this country [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2209.2s)]
*  that people that want to come in here and be like, you fucking suck. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2212.2s)]
*  You're stupid. You support terrorism. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2215.2s)]
*  Like you only demonstrate how stupid you are. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2217.2s)]
*  And it makes me sad. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2220.2s)]
*  It makes me really sad that we are at this stage. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2222.2s)]
*  Anyway, spoke with President Trump briefly this morning. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2225.2s)]
*  I asked him about those reports that Israel urged Trump administration [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2228.2s)]
*  to join the war with Iran to eliminate its nuclear program. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2230.2s)]
*  Burgles! With the 50 big ones. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2233.2s)]
*  We're not involved in it. It's possible. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2236.2s)]
*  We could get involved, but we are not at this moment. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2238.2s)]
*  The president said, asked President Trump about Putin serving as a mediator in the conflict. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2240.2s)]
*  Yeah, I would be open to it. He is ready. He called me about it. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2244.2s)]
*  We had a long talk about it. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2247.2s)]
*  We talked about this more than this, than his situation. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2248.2s)]
*  This is something I believe. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2251.2s)]
*  On Minnesota, I asked the president about the assassination [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2252.2s)]
*  and whether he plans to call the state's democratic governor tomorrow. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2254.2s)]
*  As well as the terrible thing. I think he's a terrible governor. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2257.2s)]
*  I think he's a grossly incompetent person, but I may, I may call him. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2259.2s)]
*  I may call other people too. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2262.2s)]
*  The president said, asked the president about Iran nuclear talks being called off. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2264.2s)]
*  And if there's a deadline for Iran to come to the table, no, there's no deadline, but they're talking. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2267.2s)]
*  They'd like to make a deal. They're talking. They continue to talk. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2271.2s)]
*  He said, the president said something like this had to happen. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2274.2s)]
*  Something like this had to happen because I think even from both sides, but something like this had to happen. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2277.2s)]
*  They want to talk and they will be talking. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2282.2s)]
*  Trump said may have forced the deal to go quicker. Actually. Yeah, totally. No, totally. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2284.2s)]
*  Like you always have to, you always, you always bring a gun to the negotiations about the other side. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2289.2s)]
*  The other side arming. And then you shoot a bunch of their family members in the process. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2296.2s)]
*  That's how you, that's how you're supposed to do diplomacy with a fucking gun. Great stuff, man. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2300.2s)]
*  Fantastic work, sir. Thank you. Yeah. I think they're just stalling and all this back and forth. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2306.2s)]
*  We're at level seven on the golden capitrine, by the way. Holy fuck. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2312.2s)]
*  I think that I think that at this point they're just stalling. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2316.2s)]
*  And the purpose of this is to continue the back and forth the tit for tat. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2320.2s)]
*  So we'll see. I mean, a ground invasion in Iran would be unimaginably devastating. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2326.2s)]
*  Xylax, thank you for the hundred get the subs. God damn. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2334.2s)]
*  Aza from Intifada, electronic Intifada reports. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2338.2s)]
*  Sounds like some Israelis are being stopped from fleeing the country in panic. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2343.2s)]
*  This is the Haaretz report that says the government has ordered airlines not to take Israelis abroad, even when rescue flights begin. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2346.2s)]
*  I don't know why they would do this. Oh fucking Christ. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2353.2s)]
*  Haaretz has the most egregious ad blocker blockers out there. It's crazy. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2357.2s)]
*  All the while in the last round of Israeli attacks on Iranian soil, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2363.2s)]
*  Iran IRGC intelligence chief has been killed in an Israeli attack, according to the IRNA, confirmed by numerous outlets. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2371.2s)]
*  Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps says its intelligence chief and two other officers were killed in an Israeli strike. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2378.2s)]
*  So they're continuing their decapitation measures, going after military commanders and also inevitably heads of state as well. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2384.2s)]
*  Well, this is really funny. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2395.2s)]
*  Naftali Bennett, Paris, 2027. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2398.2s)]
*  Hasbro has gotten worse and worse. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2402.2s)]
*  I don't know what happened, but look at this one. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2406.2s)]
*  This is Naftali Bennett and Naftali Bennett making an argument for more European support to Israel. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2409.2s)]
*  I don't know what the fuck European support to Israel. More of it would look like at this point. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2415.2s)]
*  This morning at 842 Paris time, a nuclear bomb was dropped on French territory in the southeast in the area of the city of Leon. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2420.2s)]
*  Military sources confirm this was a direct attack by the Iranian regime. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2432.2s)]
*  There at least they're openly admitting they launched a war, which is kind of funny. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2438.2s)]
*  This is a Call of Duty trailer. Yeah, no, Israel is saving the world. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2443.2s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, this is this is why they had that they had to kill a bunch of fucking children and bomb Iran and they get bombed in retaliation in return and have like some Tel Aviv city blocks look like maybe a fraction of the violence that they brought about to Gaza.

*  And, you know, now they're sitting in it. Yeah, the look at this is the funniest. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2466.2s)]
*  They're fucking turning us into Gaza. They're not. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2470.2s)]
*  Iran does not have complete control over Israel and Israeli society. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2474.2s)]
*  Iran does not know Iran does not have the population registry of all Israeli civilians. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2478.2s)]
*  Iran does not have a way of shutting off the electricity of Israel and stop delivering aid into Israel. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2484.2s)]
*  Iran does not have a complete siege over Israel. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2495.2s)]
*  There is no comparison. There are no fucking Iranian quadcopters speaking Hebrew to Israeli civilians and then shooting them in the fucking head. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2498.2s)]
*  Are you surprised by the number of missiles that Israel is unable to intercept? [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2507.2s)]
*  No, I am not because there's two different mindsets on this. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2511.2s)]
*  Okay, there is a anti missile defense systems are fake truthers out there, which I am not in agreement with. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2517.2s)]
*  There are there are some truthers out there that have been actively talking about how like most of these like anti missile capabilities are actually fake. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2527.2s)]
*  Like they don't actually intercept as much and they do stat padding because they look at like dummy missiles and act as though or missiles that fail. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2535.2s)]
*  And act as though they were successful interceptions. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2546.2s)]
*  I don't believe that, but there is some truth to how these like missile volleys work. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2550.2s)]
*  Some of them don't work and deploy in the process. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2557.2s)]
*  Some of them don't have any warheads in them. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2563.2s)]
*  Some of them are supposed to be dummies to exhaust the resources of the anti missile capabilities on the ground. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2566.2s)]
*  And and all of that is packaged up with like all of that pack is packaged up to the success rating. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2576.2s)]
*  It is definitely a little bit hyped up. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2584.2s)]
*  Keep in mind, not really Bennett's campaign, which started as soon as election season comes around is currently polling is the biggest party in the Knesset right now. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2586.2s)]
*  It's kind of ironic how this mirrors what Nanny Aho did after he lost the election to Ehud Barak in 1999 going on an international tour to gain connections only to return to politics much stronger than the left. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2592.2s)]
*  He's pulling at 27 seats compared to 21 to 24 for BB. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2602.2s)]
*  But yeah, there is definitely there is definitely a lot of I mean, it's not surprising to me that yes, you can exhaust the anti missile systems. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2607.2s)]
*  You can, you will inevitably exhaust the anti missile systems and even strike at the at the Tamir interceptor launchers, even though they're mobile and they move around. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2618.2s)]
*  You can just fucking tunnel in on them and eventually blow them up. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2632.2s)]
*  And then you have an easier way to guitar cat. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2636.2s)]
*  Thank you for the 64 gives us up. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2642.2s)]
*  You have an easier way to fucking actually strike with some of your bigger, some of your faster missiles. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2644.2s)]
*  The cornyness of Israel's PR strategy is it usually as it kills untold scores of people has never stopped being unbelieving audience or idiots who will start clapping like seals at the idea of posting on Facebook. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2651.2s)]
*  Israel sells defense operations in Lego. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2660.2s)]
*  This is from the Arabic. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2663.2s)]

*  They plan the Al Aqsa flood and reaped the flood. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2667.2s)]
*  Watch this video of operation presented by artificial intelligence on audible narration, but clearly showcasing the precise planning technological capabilities on the Israeli side. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2670.2s)]
*  This is so soy. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2677.2s)]
*  It's like it's it's frustrating how soy this is. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2679.2s)]
*  I can't watch the rest of this is bullshit. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2701.2s)]
*  All right, so let's get to the Israel stuff and then I'll go back to the new waves. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2705.2s)]
*  I'll go back to the the manhunt in a second attacks between Israel and a reddit country, dude, Ron, the deaths and destruction mounting on both sides. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2711.2s)]
*  And today's scheduled negotiations over Iran's nuclear program. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2720.2s)]
*  Also a casualty. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2724.2s)]

*  Oh, oh, it's really broadcasting authority citing two Israeli ministers stated that the state of emergency on the home front could last for a month. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2728.2s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2736.2s)]
*  What happened? [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2738.2s)]
*  The other day they were saying two weeks, two days ago, they were saying two weeks. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2740.2s)]
*  Now they're saying a month. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2746.2s)]
*  What did I tell you? [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2748.2s)]
*  What did I tell you? [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2750.2s)]
*  When when a when a politician says, oh, this thing is going to last only two weeks. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2751.2s)]
*  Remember, it's never two weeks. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2758.2s)]
*  OK, it's never two weeks when someone says when someone says when an official says, oh, this is just going to last two weeks. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2760.2s)]
*  Don't worry, guys. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2771.2s)]
*  Know that shit ain't lasting. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2772.2s)]
*  OK, it is going to go on. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2774.2s)]
*  I don't think it'll last. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2776.2s)]
*  I'm not going to go on. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2777.2s)]
*  I don't think it'll last a month, but we'll see if they are looking at if they're looking at like, oh, this is going to last for a month. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2778.2s)]
*  That means it's going to be for a lot longer than a month. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2786.2s)]
*  Israel with the very latest. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2789.2s)]
*  Good morning, Marcus. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2791.2s)]
*  Janay, good morning to you. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2793.2s)]
*  We are just south of Tel Aviv at the site where an Iranian missile landed on a residential building overnight. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2795.2s)]
*  And you can see the damage. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2801.2s)]
*  Also, crews have been urgently searching for three people who are said to be missing in that rubble. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2802.2s)]
*  And Janay, we also learned overnight that several people died here, including children. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2808.2s)]
*  Overnight, Iran and Israel trading more fire, both nations carrying out fresh waves of deadly attacks. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2815.2s)]
*  In Israel, video circulating online capturing this massive strike in the coastal town of Bat Yam. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2822.2s)]
*  At least six people killed, including two children and more than 100 wounded, according to Israel's emergency services. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2828.2s)]
*  Here you can see the aftermath. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2838.2s)]
*  First responders rushing to the scene, desperately searching for survivors amid the rubble. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2841.2s)]
*  Three residents still missing. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2846.2s)]
*  Iran's barrage of dozens of missiles and drones seen soaring over Jordan towards Israel. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2850.2s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2855.2s)]
*  And flying over Jerusalem with sirens blaring from the north down to Tel Aviv. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2857.2s)]
*  Israel's air defense system, including the Iron Dome, intercepting some of the aerial assault like the Sirani and drone. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2862.2s)]
*  But several missiles evading the system, hitting their targets. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2870.2s)]
*  Medics saying at least four people were killed and 14 injured in a direct hit on the Arab Israeli town of Tamra. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2874.2s)]
*  Israel also intensifying its attacks. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2882.2s)]
*  This massive fire raging at an Iranian oil depot after an Israeli strike, according to the Iranian Ministry of Oil. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2884.2s)]
*  Images throughout Tehran capturing the area in flames. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2891.2s)]
*  And these new satellite images showing the before and after of this Revolutionary Guard military facility hit by the Israeli assault. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2895.2s)]
*  Israel claims it has killed at least nine Iranian nuclear scientists since its surprise operation earlier this week. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2902.2s)]
*  Iran saying at least 78 people have been killed. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2909.2s)]
*  The death toll climbing on both sides with no immediate signs of peace. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2912.2s)]
*  And back here at the scene, you can feel the tension. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2918.2s)]
*  You can also feel the sadness here as these search and rescue teams continue their work. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2921.2s)]
*  And, Janai, this is just one site of at least 20 across Israel where there was either a direct hit or debris fell from the sky onto buildings. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2926.2s)]
*  And it happens at a time when there are calls for diplomacy and restraint. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2935.2s)]
*  But Janai, as you know, that meeting that was set to happen today on a potential new Iran nuclear deal, that meeting called off because of these Israeli strikes. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2940.2s)]
*  Janai. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2949.2s)]
*  And we will see what happens next. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2950.2s)]
*  Marcus Moore, we appreciate your reporting from the region. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2951.2s)]
*  Israeli airstrikes have relentlessly battered, but Iran is still managing to fight back. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2958.2s)]
*  Six people were killed and dozens wounded when this apartment block near Tel Aviv took a direct hit. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2963.2s)]
*  They were still pulling people out of the wreckage many hours later. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2969.2s)]
*  So we're currently after about 20 hours of working on the site, trying to put together an intelligence picture to understand who was in which apartment, who was in home. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2972.2s)]
*  We've gathered a lot of intelligence and put together a picture to try to figure out who we're looking for, where we should be looking for, specifically in the building that collapsed. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2983.2s)]
*  We extract extracted a few casualties until now, up to now. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2993.2s)]
*  The Israeli military says that 80 ballistic missiles were fired at Israel throughout Saturday night. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=2999.2s)]
*  Millions spent a third night sheltering in safe rooms. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3005.2s)]
*  These are the neighboring streets. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3009.2s)]
*  And even though they didn't take a direct hit, look at the damage on the buildings. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3012.2s)]
*  I mean, the shutters completely blown in, windows blown in. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3016.2s)]
*  And then if you look down here, we can't go any further because the recovery operation is going on. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3019.2s)]
*  The damage is immense down there. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3027.2s)]
*  And you can really see why there were so many dozens of injuries here and six people killed in the building where the missile hit directly. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3030.2s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu visited the site and warned that Iran would pay a heavy price for civilian casualties. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3042.2s)]
*  And Israel's president, Isaac Herzog, called on the country's allies to stand by them. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3049.2s)]
*  And I call upon the leaders of the G7 who will convene tomorrow in Canada. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3054.2s)]
*  I think there has been, and maybe I'm crazy, but like these kinds of images coming out of Israel is unique. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3059.2s)]
*  Okay. And a lot of people are watching from afar and they're not really saying a lot. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3069.2s)]
*  And wait, what is this? Jason? The Wien is calling me. What's up, dude? I'm live. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3076.2s)]

*  I could walk your dog, you know, anything, anything you need. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3111.2s)]
*  But why is this like a bed? Did you lose a bed? So I'm doing like this 24 hours. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3115.2s)]

*  Okay. I mean, I am in need. I am in need of an assistant. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3127.2s)]
*  Okay, I'm going to need you to get me two sleeves, like five packs of zins that are six milligrams in coffee. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3134.2s)]
*  Let me write this down. No, six, six milligrams. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3145.2s)]
*  I'm fucking up six milligrams of zins. Yeah, six milligrams in two sleeves, citrus flavor and coffee flavor. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3151.2s)]

*  Look at that. Going to get my going to the store to get my grandpa wheelchair and some Zins. Stop wasting his talents only Zins. I mean, that's the only thing I need. What do you mean? I'm taking it seriously. Since when do you Zin? I don't stop Zining. I'm a I'm a Zin Fidel. I'm waiting on this too, but it's coming from a Israeli attack on the Fordow nuclear site. Armies Air Defense actively engaged Tehran correspondent for France 24 English says there was an attack on Fordow. That's the only thing I need. I'm taking it seriously. Since when do you Zin?

*  the underground one, that's a deep underground nuclear facility that they have. Hold on. Let me send them Israeli soldiers rated Palestinian prisoners jail cells to beat them after showing joy over the attacks is not. I mean, that's, that's classic. Okay. Listen, listen. We were getting back to the damage. I was going to make a statement here. Hold on before I got interrupted by nephew. Okay. So one of the things that we've seen that is truly unique is these images of like, [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3314.2s)]
*  hollowed out buildings in Israel. Okay. And, and what's interesting about this is that like a lot of people in Israel, a lot of people in Israel are demanding a show of support from the Western world. And I'm gonna keep it a buck 50 post October 7. There was a lot of support for Israel. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3344.2s)]
*  But since this is happening after 20 months of ethnic cleansing and cheers coming from Israeli society towards that kind of ethnic cleansing campaign, this paired up with the fact that like the casualties have been fairly limited due to Israeli technology and American technology defending Israel. And also simultaneously like the, the shelters that they have all around Tel Aviv. Most people have not said anything like people that you would expect to be in Israel. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3371.2s)]
*  And I think that's the thing that's really interesting about this is that like, you know, I think that there's a lot of people who constantly talk about how Israel is the, is the victim here. They're like, with the exception of our politicians who have never straight away from being maximalist in terms of like defending Israel. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3401.2s)]
*  They're still helping behind the scenes, but you're right. They don't want to be loud about it because it's so unpopular. No, of course they're helping. I'm just, I'm like, I'm definitely surprised. I mean, yeah, this is a great example of this. Sending, sending love Israel in a, in a shelter. We don't need to ceasefire October 24, 2024. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3420.2s)]
*  Like this has 150,000 likes. Like I'm seeing a lot of people hit the you reap what you sow button. And this has been a fairly limited, fairly restrained response. I'll give you an example. I'll give you an example. Okay. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3442.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3459.2s)]
*  Israel's first strike and continued strikes on Iran, even then has killed 200 plus Iranians. 90% of them are civilians, right? They've killed children. They've killed babies in, in Tehran. And in retaliation from the Iranian attacks, there have been casualties. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3461.2s)]
*  Okay. There have been casualties. I'm not entirely certain on like what the casualties look like. I haven't seen too much information on this front, but the fact that there is like even no parody, the fact that there is no there. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3485.2s)]
*  The fact that this is symmetry of, of victims are still so, so sizable and, and so like, so real this without even the backdrop of the unlimited ethnic cleansing, the unlimited ethnic cleansing that's taking place in, in Gaza, I think has, has basically caused a lot of the Western world, even that would normally at least offer platitudes. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3501.2s)]
*  To turn around and say, yeah, you know, what are you going to do about it? I mean, this guy's an American, this guy's an American pro Israel guy. You pray innocent children die. Okay. I'm okay with as many dead kids as it takes to stop Hamas. It's not even a joke. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3531.2s)]
*  By the way, Zionist will post up like, hi, I'm in a bomb shelter in Tel Aviv right now. And I might not make it out alive. So this message could be my last message, but I just want to say Zoram. I'm done. He should not become the mayor of New York. That is almost a verbatim direct one to one [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3547.2s)]
*  comparison, a one to one copy of that, that gay Zionist influencer, Blake Sheldon or whatever the fuck his name is, who tweeted out about how he's in a bomb shelter and like, and he's like really worried about how all of his fucking supposed allies in the West are celebrating a [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3561.2s)]
*  potential Zoran victory in the New York mayoral primaries. It's like, bro, like, what the fuck are you saying? If this is a real, if this is a real struggle for you, if you're like, actually, moments away from dying, what the fuck are you doing tweeting about Zoram? I'm Donnie. What do you mean? Blake Sheldon? I'm confused. What's this fucking a Flayton Blake Flayton, not Blake Sheldon, losing friends left and right today.

*  conflict, but we're just getting lines from Iran telling mediators [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3935.26s)]
*  Qatar and Oman that it is not open to negotiating with Israel [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3940.22s)]
*  whilst under Israeli attacks. So that does appear that it is [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3945.06s)]
*  closing off lines of mediation at this point. Yes, I think so. I [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3948.58s)]
*  think Iranians, I was listening to Foreign Minister Arachi's [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3952.66s)]
*  conference with foreign ambassadors in Tehran, and my [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3957.98s)]
*  sense from his statements was that Tehran is expecting the IAEA's [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3964.06s)]
*  board of governors tomorrow's session to condemn Israel's [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3970.58s)]
*  attack on Iranian nuclear facilities, which by the way, are [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3977.02s)]
*  a violation of international law. And my, again, my impression [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3980.3s)]
*  is that unless there is such condemnation, Tehran will not [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3985.58s)]
*  agree to any mediation or de-escalation efforts. However, [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3990.42s)]
*  I think it is important to note that Iran, compared to Israel, [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=3999.2599999999998s)]
*  has more limited resources to wage war. Israel has quantitative [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4007.06s)]
*  and quantitative advantage in firepower. Iranians have been [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4014.02s)]
*  able to attack Israel, but they cannot sustain it for a long [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4018.42s)]
*  period of time. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4023.82s)]
*  Yeah, that's interesting, because our correspondent, [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4024.98s)]
*  Tohe Dasadi, was saying just earlier that the Iranians are [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4026.62s)]
*  saying that they are preparing for years of war. But I was [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4029.54s)]
*  wondering how capable Iran is of sustaining that sort of... [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4033.18s)]
*  Iran has a ton of missiles and also has missile productions [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4038.2599999999998s)]
*  where I think they can do 12 new... And they already have [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4042.18s)]
*  thousands in their arsenal. They are definitely equipped to [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4045.58s)]
*  continue... They are definitely equipped to continue drone, [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4052.8199999999997s)]
*  droning Israel and also simultaneously launching 12 a [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4056.1s)]
*  month is nothing. Now, I know, but I'm saying that they already [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4061.18s)]
*  have production capabilities of building new ones on top [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4065.5s)]
*  of the thousands they have in their arsenal. Iran does not [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4072.02s)]
*  have nukes right now. Whereas a war of attrition demands [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4076.02s)]
*  American, steady American flow of weapons into Israel and [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4084.3s)]
*  America's flow of weapons... Now, the 12 a month is the big [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4088.66s)]
*  ballistic ones, but I'm saying that American logistics is the [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4095.98s)]
*  only thing that will allow Israel to continue bombing Iran. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4103.54s)]
*  Sustain this for a very long time. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4110.1s)]
*  So other than missile barrages, what other retaliatory options [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4112.9s)]
*  are available to Iran? [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4116.86s)]
*  Well, not many. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4119.9400000000005s)]
*  The conservative estimate is 50 a month. The US fears Iran's [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4121.54s)]
*  response to Israel strike would be a mass casualty event. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4124.22s)]
*  Iran can use its friends in the region to start attacking Israeli [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4127.14s)]
*  interests, but that risks dragging the United States into [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4132.58s)]
*  a war with Iran. Iranian Air Force is quite limited in terms [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4138.58s)]
*  of its ability to project power. They might be able to pull off [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4143.58s)]
*  perhaps one or two long range strikes. But other than that, I [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4147.9800000000005s)]
*  don't think Iran has many options to, again, conduct a full [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4153.3s)]
*  all out war in the long term. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4161.42s)]
*  Okay, that will leave it. Sina Azadi, many thanks indeed for [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4164.7s)]
*  joining us once again here on Al Jazeera. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4167.9400000000005s)]
*  Let's now go to Giorgio Cafiero. He's the chief executive and [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4171.860000000001s)]
*  founder of Gulf State Analytics, a geopolitical risk consultancy [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4175.34s)]
*  based in Washington, DC. He joins us from there. What do you [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4178.7s)]
*  make of what Sina was just saying, that Iran is not well [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4181.7s)]
*  equipped for a prolonged war? [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4185.18s)]
*  Well, I certainly think my great friend Sina Azadi, also a [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4189.38s)]
*  brilliant analyst as usual, making very, very good points. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4193.58s)]
*  I think that this is appearing to be a conflict that could [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4198.38s)]
*  possibly be drawn out over quite a bit of time. And when you have [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4203.58s)]
*  both Israel and Iran underwater, there's kind of a question about [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4207.099999999999s)]
*  who's going to have to come up for air first. And the points [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4211.46s)]
*  he's raising really go to these important questions about how [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4214.62s)]
*  sustainable this is. I think there are certain advantages [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4218.38s)]
*  that both of these countries have, but it's very legitimate to [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4222.86s)]
*  raise questions about the sustainability of Iran's [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4226.9800000000005s)]
*  military campaign. I think there's also going to be [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4231.02s)]
*  important questions to ask about the extent to which other [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4234.18s)]
*  powerful countries in the world, such as Russia and China, might [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4239.0599999999995s)]
*  help Iran in various capacities. So those are some of the really [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4242.46s)]
*  important variables in the equation. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4248.46s)]
*  Yeah, because if we're seeing Russia and China being dragged [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4250.219999999999s)]
*  in, then we almost certainly will see the US dragged in too. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4252.78s)]
*  Yeah, you know, Russia and China have good relations with Iran [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4257.9s)]
*  and also rather good relations with Israel too. I'm not [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4262.0599999999995s)]
*  expecting either Russia or China to decisively intervene on [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4266.74s)]
*  Iran's behalf. But I think there are certain moves they could [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4271.82s)]
*  make that could possibly assist Iran in some ways. But ultimately, [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4275.9s)]
*  those are two countries that really have vested interests in [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4279.94s)]
*  stability in the Gulf region and the Middle East at large. You [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4283.78s)]
*  know, for China, when we talk about the Belt and Road, I mean, [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4287.9s)]
*  everything that's going on right now with Iran and Israel poses a [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4290.42s)]
*  huge threat to China's ambitious geo economic goals in the Middle [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4293.98s)]
*  East. And Russia also very much depends on [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4300.099999999999s)]
*  update on the death toll from the Iranian Health Ministry. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4303.0199999999995s)]
*  224 people have been killed and around 1277 injured since [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4307.339999999999s)]
*  Israeli strikes began on Friday, spokesperson Hossein Karman Por [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4310.98s)]
*  said over 90% of the casualties were civilians. As hospitals [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4313.78s)]
*  continue to receive wounded from across the country, the Israeli [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4317.0199999999995s)]
*  assault targeting military nuclear and civilian sites killed [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4320.54s)]
*  several senior generals and nuclear scientists along with [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4322.7s)]
*  their families and neighbors. Israel for its part, reports 14 [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4324.78s)]
*  dead and 390 injured since Friday, though that figure [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4329.7s)]
*  includes individuals treated for acute anxiety, which Israeli [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4332.66s)]
*  official Israelis officially count as casualties of war. As [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4335.82s)]
*  far as like the bandwidth that they have, US intelligence [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4340.66s)]
*  estimates US intelligence estimates that Iran has 2000 [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4344.62s)]
*  ballistic missiles with warheads that can carry 2000 pounds of [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4349.0199999999995s)]
*  explosives or more. A US official said Israel within range [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4351.34s)]
*  for many of the missiles. On Wednesday, Iran's Minister of [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4355.02s)]
*  Defense claimed Iran developed a new ballistic missile with a [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4357.54s)]
*  4000 pound warhead. US official said that since the previous [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4359.62s)]
*  Iranian missile strikes on Israel in October 24, Iran has [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4363.42s)]
*  significantly increased production of ballistic missiles [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4366.22s)]
*  to around 50 per month. Sorry, I said 20. I said 12 per month. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4368.18s)]
*  It's I have no reason not to believe the US official estimate [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4372.3s)]
*  here. It's probably 50 a month. Those are the big boys though. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4375.34s)]
*  The official said that the Iranian goal is to produce more [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4378.58s)]
*  ballistic missiles and the number of missile defense [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4381.02s)]

*  this going for quite a while. Whereas Israel in order to [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4387.38s)]
*  continue hitting Iran has to get an endless amount of munitions [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4393.06s)]
*  from the endless amount of munitions from the United States [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4398.9400000000005s)]
*  of America and other Western allies who have already limited [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4403.22s)]
*  who have already diminished their supply due to Israel's [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4407.54s)]
*  previous genocidal incursions in Gaza, and also defending Ukraine, [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4410.82s)]
*  even though the Ukrainian defenses did not require I [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4416.54s)]
*  don't think as much like the same type of munitions that [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4419.86s)]
*  Israel demands. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4424.9s)]
*  Maintaining that Israel is a special country that doesn't [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4425.98s)]
*  have to respect international law in this Western hypocrisy [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4428.94s)]
*  has not surprised me at all. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4432.78s)]
*  One of the main [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4435.5s)]
*  also, this is developing US aircraft carrier USS Nimitz and [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4437.179999999999s)]
*  its combat teams are currently on their way to the Middle East. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4442.7s)]
*  I doubt the US will be committing additional forces the [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4444.9s)]
*  region on top of personnel slash assets already there as the [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4446.82s)]
*  plan wasn't to join Israel's war on Iran. The US is already [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4449.62s)]
*  operating as Israel's air defense question is what will [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4452.86s)]
*  serve as pretext to join the bombing? It's true Americans [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4455.58s)]
*  across the political spectrum opposed being further dragged [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4459.58s)]
*  in the war with Iran, but the Trump admin will likely spin it [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4461.74s)]
*  as not ground forces aren't involved. I mean, we saw what [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4464.58s)]
*  they did in Yevhen same template here. Did Israel miscalculate [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4466.94s)]
*  Iran's response? No, I don't think they did. I think Israel [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4470.22s)]

*  joins us from Banff in Western Canada. So, James, what are we [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4608.139999999999s)]
*  expecting there from the G7? [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4611.58s)]
*  Well, they're all arriving. We've seen the Australian Prime [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4617.86s)]
*  Minister, we've seen the British Prime Minister in the last few [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4621.099999999999s)]
*  minutes, just a few moments, in fact. We've seen the Canadian [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4623.219999999999s)]
*  Prime Minister, the host, Mark Carney, at Calgary Airport. The [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4626.259999999999s)]
*  leaders are making their way from Calgary Airport. Prime Minister [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4630.54s)]
*  Carney just got in a car. But the other leaders are the other two [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4634.5s)]
*  we've seen making their way in Chinook helicopters to the [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4638.34s)]
*  mountaintop resort where they're holding Banff looks like Europe. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4642.62s)]
*  It sounds like a European city as well. So for the record, if [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4646.54s)]
*  America goes to war, that means the entire Western world goes to [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4652.62s)]
*  war. Just so you understand, make no mistake, like, this is war on [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4655.02s)]
*  terror 2.0. This is invasion of Iraq. There will be some naysayers. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4660.86s)]
*  What is this? This was a building inside Tehran itself. 200 [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4666.34s)]
*  kilograms of explosives, 30 drones, wings, 33 launchers and [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4671.42s)]
*  equipment for making drones were discovered in a three story [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4674.62s)]
*  building that was a base for operations against Iran. It was [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4677.58s)]
*  discovered things were reported by a normal citizen. Yeah, they [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4680.5s)]
*  built a drone production facility inside of Tehran. This [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4683.58s)]
*  right here is what I was talking about when I enormous national [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4687.22s)]
*  security threat to Iran. Like a competent government is not a [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4691.860000000001s)]
*  competent government doesn't allow drone production happening [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4697.42s)]
*  inside of its own fucking national boundaries. The fact [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4702.66s)]
*  that Masada is able to penetrate this deep into Iranian society [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4705.9400000000005s)]
*  is crazy. This is for any country that wants to preserve [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4710.7s)]
*  its sovereignty. This is a terrifying prospect. And I think [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4715.54s)]
*  a big part of this, a big part of this project. No, it's not [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4719.86s)]
*  propaganda. Why would the Iranian government show this dude? This [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4723.78s)]
*  also corresponds to the Israeli propaganda on their side. This is [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4727.18s)]
*  this is not this is an L the Iranian government is [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4730.9s)]
*  broadcasting his own L in this situation. I think like, [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4733.42s)]
*  something I mean, it's not even comparable to talk about the [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4739.42s)]
*  Ukrainian drone strikes, you couldn't drone drone strikes deep [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4742.34s)]
*  in Russian territory. This is so much more sophisticated than [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4746.62s)]
*  that. The Ukrainian drone strikes deep in Russian [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4750.9800000000005s)]
*  territory with the trucks was a sophisticated campaign for sure. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4753.26s)]
*  This is infinitely more sophisticated than that. And the [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4756.82s)]
*  reason why it's happening is because Iranian society has is [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4761.14s)]
*  leaky. There's too much instability. There's too much [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4766.02s)]
*  instability. It is a it is a matter of national security [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4769.54s)]
*  concern. The economic pressure has clearly worked in terms of [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4773.74s)]
*  creating collaborators within paired up with also the the [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4779.46s)]
*  fundamentalist government oftentimes repressing the [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4786.0199999999995s)]
*  population. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4788.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4797.94s)]
*  Very, very careful consideration of the best way to handle the US [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4799.94s)]
*  president. It's gonna be very interesting meeting to watch James [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4804.98s)]
*  Bays. Many thanks for joining us from Banff. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4807.82s)]
*  This exists all over the region. Iran borders Azerbaijan and KRG [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4814.34s)]
*  both have missile bases. The only reason we see it happen in Iran [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4817.54s)]
*  is because Iran is at war. You don't think this exists in Turkey, [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4820.06s)]
*  Egypt, brother, a great example of this is what the United States [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4822.22s)]
*  of America did in Turkey with a parallel government, deeply [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4826.9s)]
*  embedded within every orifice of the state. Okay. A parallel [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4830.74s)]
*  government was developed by the CIA in Turkey. America already [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4836.219999999999s)]
*  has unprecedented access to Turkey. Turkey is a NATO [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4841.259999999999s)]
*  country. The Turkish government is already an American asset. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4844.219999999999s)]
*  And even that wasn't enough because they thought Erdogan was [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4848.66s)]
*  too unstable. And they they tried to do a coup. It failed. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4851.3s)]
*  Did you happen to get out yesterday? Just curious? Yeah. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4856.820000000001s)]
*  Although I will say people in Iran is completely repressed and [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4859.06s)]
*  poor. These people literally look like normal as young people [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4861.54s)]
*  and normalized very eye opening. Ignore the account. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4863.62s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, oh, yeah, I mean, I saw this video earlier. Yeah, [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4866.9800000000005s)]
*  dude. Listen, listen, listen. This is Yeah, of course, dude. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4870.14s)]
*  Iranian society is just like a normal country, man. What the [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4874.54s)]
*  fuck? [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4877.46s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4881.54s)]
*  It's so funny because like, I mean, this is the same with like [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4906.18s)]
*  Turkey, too. I always forget that like Americans literally [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4908.74s)]
*  think that that side of the world is just like all people [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4912.9s)]
*  dripped up in like Bedouin gear, riding camels, the fucking work. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4918.26s)]
*  You know, like this is the least surprising. Yeah. Living under [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4923.54s)]
*  the militancy of Sharia law. Here is an update from Gaza by [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4928.9s)]
*  Hind Qadari. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4934.7s)]
*  Ukraine's military says it has hit a Russian drone factory in [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4935.86s)]
*  the city. Nevermind. I'm confused. Why is this video [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4939.179999999999s)]
*  interesting to people? The reason why this is interesting [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4941.66s)]
*  to people is because it just like completely warps it [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4944.62s)]
*  completely changes their perspective. I've had family [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4948.98s)]
*  members who traveled to Iran as tourists and they all said they [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4951.0599999999995s)]
*  had the nicest time. Yeah, Iran is beautiful, too. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=4953.3s)]
*  Why? [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=5026.74s)]
*  To mollusks do exist. The Iranian government is a [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=5031.5s)]
*  repressive force. A lot of these people that are being filmed [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=5034.86s)]
*  are understandably very anti Iranian government. Okay. But [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=5038.86s)]
*  of course, it's them being anti Iranian government for domestic [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=5045.42s)]
*  reasons does not change the reality that like getting blown [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=5050.5s)]
*  up, blown the bits from a powerful outside force is not [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=5055.34s)]
*  going to cause them to go. Oh, thank God. All of the all of the [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=5064.02s)]
*  the anti government statements that you hear about people in [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=5068.5s)]
*  Iran being like, Oh, we love that Israel and America are [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=5072.3s)]
*  liberating us like are there are there pro America pros really [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=5076.02s)]
*  forces within Iran? Absolutely. Okay. But the majority [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=5079.78s)]
*  population and including people who are very, very, very anti the [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=5084.58s)]
*  Iranian government, Iranian leadership are still focusing on [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=5090.34s)]
*  the much bigger evil here. If Israel can achieve regime change, [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkCym4ErzU&t=5094.98s)]
