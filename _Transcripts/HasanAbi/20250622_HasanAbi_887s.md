# 'Slightly Heightened' Risk For Americans After Iran Attack | HasanAbi Archive
**HasanAbi:** [June 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc)
*  Why do you say Obama was right? If we didn't do this shit, Iran might've have, might've [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=0.0s)]
*  had a new and they wouldn't be getting their shit pushed in. No, no. If the, if the JCPO [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=4.22s)]
*  a continued, if the JCPO a continued and that we normalize relationships, we'd normalize [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  relations with Iran. Iran would be a more prosperous nation as a consequence, but Donald [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=15.84s)]
*  Trump cast that aside, but I'm going to watch this. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=20.6s)]
*  Fox News contributor and former secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, Mr. Secretary, thank [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=27.92s)]
*  you for getting up early. If you will, just your reaction to what has transpired and to [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=32.64s)]
*  put into context for us, how significant of an operation of a moment is this? Well, good [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=38.160000000000004s)]
*  morning. It's a very significant dude. Every time what though, bro, every time I see Pompeo, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=43.68s)]
*  he's just like shriveling. I feel like he gave his life force. I know it's so Zempig, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=49.160000000000004s)]
*  obviously, but I like to think in my head, Canon that he's giving all of his power to, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=55.12s)]
*  to Israel. You know what I mean? Like every day, Pompeo's life force is being sucked out [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=61.4s)]
*  of him so that Israel can, Israel can keep doing, keep up its anti-aircraft defense capabilities [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=68.12s)]
*  and anti-air defense capabilities. If Iran keeps the Israel, Mike Pompeo is going to [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=76.24s)]
*  shrivel further. Stop. Why won't they stop Tel Aviv every day that goes by? He's just, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=82.0s)]
*  how is this the same? It's because it's because he's giving his life force to Israel, man. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=88.32s)]
*  I'm telling you, this has got to be, this is either the most devastating Ozempic hit [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=96.52s)]
*  of all time. This is the amount of Ozempic, like from this to this implies that he's eaten [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=102.96s)]
*  like three almonds in the past year. Okay. That's his entire consumption of food. He's [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=108.92s)]
*  just been burning the existing supply nonstop or the second thing, which I think is more [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=115.08s)]
*  likely he's, he's giving up his life force to defend Israel. Biden's white house Jewish [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=121.56s)]
*  liaison. This marks a significant and historic step in preventing around the world's foremost [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=128.6s)]
*  state sponsor of terrorism from obtaining a weapon. God bless America says Shelley greenspan. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=133.04s)]
*  Thank you. This certainly is going to make things great for Jews in America. Yeah. The [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=139.16s)]
*  more we, the more we strike Iran at the behest of Israel and the more our politicians openly [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=147.12s)]
*  talk about how Israel is dominating every facet of our existence and our politics, the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=154.24s)]
*  more the everyday American thinks we are certainly not a nation state totally captive to the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=160.84s)]
*  whims of Israel, which you guys then claim is the Jewish state and it's doing it for [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=168.35999999999999s)]
*  the Jews. This certainly will not increase enmity towards the Jews in America. I'm sure, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=174.35999999999999s)]
*  I'm sure these guys are thinking this through good stuff. If an operation, our military [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=181.48s)]
*  did indeed, as president Trump said, carry out an operation that there's no, there's [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=188.35999999999999s)]
*  no other country in the world could do. That's been years and years in the making, but the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=192.16s)]
*  folks who were flying last night were brave and capable and clearly delivered on their [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=196.64s)]
*  mission and every American should be incredibly proud of that and thankful for them. As for [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=200.48s)]
*  what resulted the world is safer today. And you were asking earlier, what do the Gulf [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=205.72s)]
*  Arab states think this morning? I am confident that they too are safer. So this was important [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=211.04s)]
*  not only for Israel and for the Gulf Arab states, but to keep the United States of America [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=215.88s)]
*  safe as well. President Trump, I served with him for four years. For a decade now, he's [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=219.4s)]
*  been very clear. They're not going to get a weapon in Iran. And this is just a further [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=225.44s)]
*  manifestation of his commitment to that over a long period of time. And last night he executed [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=230.35999999999999s)]
*  a mission that was righteous and decent and important and will keep us all safer. Mr. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=235.04s)]
*  Secretary, you say the world is safer today and I understand the logic there, but I mean, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=239.6s)]
*  I think it's reasonable to say that the service members stationed in the Middle East probably [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=243.88s)]
*  aren't safer today. Do you have any prediction on what Iran's retaliation might look like [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=248.6s)]
*  if they would target capabilities as opposed to troops or anything like that? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=253.96s)]
*  No, that's a good point. Look, it's always hard to put your own soldiers, sailors, airmen [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=258.52s)]
*  and Marines lives at risk. I remember when we took the Soleimani strike, we were very [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=265.8s)]
*  worried and had done a ton of work to keep folks at Al-Assad Air Base and our other facilities [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=269.68s)]
*  in the Middle East safe. I'm confident that the administration has taken those protections [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=273.92s)]
*  as well. Make no mistake about it, the Iranians could come after that, but President Trump [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=278.24s)]
*  has set the course, right? He said, you're not going to have a weapon and if you come [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=282.68s)]
*  after an American, we're going to wreak absolute hell on you. I think the Iranian regime is [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=285.96000000000004s)]
*  thinking through that in the same way they did after we took out General Soleimani. While [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=290.96000000000004s)]
*  we had some soldiers injured, their response was relatively weak. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=295.64s)]
*  I'm going to put this out here one more time. I hate to do it, but the globe Twitter accounts [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=299.6s)]
*  are correct. The Obama Dick writers are correct on this. Okay. Sorry. That's ridiculous. Okay. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=307.88s)]
*  Every single time you say this, just show them the chart. This is, it's just liberals [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=319.15999999999997s)]
*  are right on this. It gives me, it gives me no pleasure to report, but the libs are right [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=324.88s)]
*  and Obama was right on this. Diplomacy was the correct option. Diplomacy was the right [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=329.96s)]
*  thing to do. It was the most effective solution. And even the way that Obama reaches diplomacy [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=338.36s)]
*  was still of course, because this is the United States of America really up. Okay. Increasing [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=342.92s)]
*  sanctions and forcing Iran to take away the sanctions, forcing Iran's hand by saying, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=350.44s)]
*  Hey, we'll take the sanctions away only to have only to kickstart the process of just [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=356.2s)]
*  like using sanctions on every country for no reason. Why do you say Obama was right? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=360.96s)]
*  If we didn't do this shit, Iran might've have might've had a nuke and they wouldn't be getting [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=367.96s)]
*  their shit pushed in. No, no. If the, if the JCPOA continued, if the JCPOA continued and [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=371.72s)]
*  that we normalize relationships, we normalize relations with Iran, Iran would be a more [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=379.24s)]
*  prosperous nation as a consequence. But Donald Trump cast that aside because it doesn't just [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=384.24s)]
*  the, the, the JCPOA has the other side of this, the American, the American involvement, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=390.6s)]
*  which is, or the, the American side of the deal, which is to, to lower sanctions and [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=397.92s)]
*  to allow Iran to participate in the global economy. Why did Biden try to get Biden and [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=405.16s)]
*  Biden try to get the JCPOA back? Hmm. Hmm. Much to think, much to think about that. I [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=409.84000000000003s)]
*  wonder why maybe because he is also ideologically invested in the greater Israeli project in [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=415.68s)]
*  spite of being a Catholic, despite the fact that Biden was a Catholic, not even an evangelical [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=422.24s)]
*  Christian. He was an ultra Zionist, an Omega Zionist. Maybe that has something to do with [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=428.24s)]
*  And they are even in a far weaker place. Their capabilities today are even far weaker than [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=433.84s)]
*  they were when we took that strike back in the first Trump administration. So I suspect [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=438.68s)]
*  they're trying to figure out what to do. I'll be very surprised if they challenge President [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=443.6s)]
*  Trump and the United States Department of Defense. Well, I hope that you're absolutely [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=447.68s)]
*  right, Mike, because we've been told that the regime is insane and genocidal. So let's [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=451.96s)]
*  hope that they're being rational right now. One of the things that I'm concerned about [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=459.88s)]
*  is that we've had four years of an open border. And so one of the, you know, we've been talking [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=464.68s)]
*  about what kind of retaliatory attacks they can make in that region, but we've had an [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=469.32s)]
*  open border and a record number of unknown and known terrorists coming across our border [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=474.2s)]
*  over the last four years. So what kind of implications does that have for the United [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=481.56s)]
*  States right now in terms of potential sleeper cells and attacks actually here on the homeland? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=486.92s)]
*  You know, I've been talking about this risk for four years. It's probably even slightly heightened [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=494.84000000000003s)]
*  now. There's no doubt the Iranian regime has tried to put active agents on the ground in [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=499.32s)]
*  Europe and Brussels and Paris and London and indeed here in the United States. And you're [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=505.64s)]
*  absolutely right. We've had a wide open border. We know that at least a couple of hundred folks [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=509.64s)]
*  who were already on the American terror designated watch list who came across the border during the [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=514.12s)]
*  Biden administration. So that risk is not zero. It could be that that'll be a method by which [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=520.04s)]
*  the Iranians will choose to try and take vengeance and respond and to deter the United States. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=525.08s)]
*  I'm counting on our FBI and local law enforcement to help keep all of us safe, including those who [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=530.36s)]
*  have been threatened directly by the regime itself. But more importantly than that, I think the [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=535.4s)]
*  Iranians calculus has to be very careful here. They have to understand that that while we've [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=539.72s)]
*  spared the political leadership and energy. So was on of your pro-JCPOA. How does that measure [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=544.44s)]
*  the Ron needing a new to protect themselves? Just curious. If Iran was treated like a country with [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=549.72s)]
*  dignity and sovereignty as was supposed to be the process in which the JCPOA JCPOA is implemented, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=556.2s)]
*  then they don't have a necessity for nukes. America doesn't play that game, of course. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=564.84s)]
*  And therefore Iran does need nukes, especially now more than ever. There are plenty of countries [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=571.24s)]
*  that currently don't have nukes. It's just, they haven't been in the crosshairs of America, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=576.52s)]
*  at least to this degree. The infrastructure targets last night. There's no guarantee that [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=581.72s)]
*  that will continue if they come after an American, whether that's one of our soldier sailors, airmen [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=587.48s)]
*  and Marines abroad or someone here in the United States. And you yourself were famously threatened [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=591.72s)]
*  by the regime as well. Means I want to get your thoughts on this because satellite images show [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=597.24s)]
*  lines of trucks leaving the Fordo facility on Thursday, about 48 hours prior to the strike. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=600.84s)]
*  Are you worried that Iran was able to move out material from Fordo? Again, it's unclear exactly [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=607.5600000000001s)]
*  what was in those trucks, but your instinct says they moved some material, whatever they could [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=615.0s)]
*  potentially move in those trucks. Are you worried about that? I think this is going to be something [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=622.44s)]
*  that the U.S. intelligence community and the Israeli intelligence community have to work their way. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=629.0s)]
*  Why would anyone agree to this? No, 100%. I think that the only way the world moves in the [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=633.0s)]
*  direction of which is, I don't know, it's, it seems very, very unlikely, but the only way that [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=639.4s)]
*  they would ever agree to it is everybody has nukes and we just evolve past that point. I don't know. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=644.68s)]
*  I just don't think that it'll, it'll happen. I think right now as a new world order is being [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=649.9599999999999s)]
*  designed in front of our eyes, Ron was saying about like the law, the jungle is actually just [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=655.48s)]
*  the truth. It's always been might as right politics. International law has just basically been paperwork [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=661.4s)]
*  that America uses to justify its military conquest against people. They'll say, Oh, our enemies are [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=667.72s)]
*  violating international human rights. We have to intervene militarily. And then they will literally [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=673.8000000000001s)]
*  fucking intervene and violate human rights altogether. That's usually that has been the [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=679.08s)]
*  case. The only thing that stops America from entertaining these violent ambitions is another [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=684.76s)]
*  powerful superpower that will force them to stop. It's even more clear now. I think it's [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=690.84s)]
*  undeniable. Anyone that still entertains the notion of, of rules and norms at this stage, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=699.0s)]
*  I think is just like diluting themselves is purposely telling themselves a fucking lie [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=704.9200000000001s)]
*  with the hopes that there is some semblance of order on the planet, or maybe because they've [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=711.64s)]
*  benefited tremendously from the current rule-based international order or their, their, their [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=716.68s)]
*  ambitions, their appetite for violence has been saved from it. And therefore they think, Oh no, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=723.4s)]
*  we have to cynically keep talking about this rule-based international order when it's obviously [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=728.3599999999999s)]
*  incredibly consequential and incredibly violent for the global South. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=734.04s)]
*  And through to figure out what they did, what they did to disperse not only those cylinders that held [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=738.12s)]
*  the highly enriched uranium, but their intellectual capital as well, that human capital that drives [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=743.4s)]
*  their program forward and the components of their ballistic missile system. They'll try to hide them [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=748.28s)]
*  and scatter them. I think that's something that we'll have to stay after. I suspect that in spite [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=752.68s)]
*  of the real success last night, there'll still be work to do to fully eradicate every remnant of their [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=757.64s)]
*  nuclear program. But I think we shouldn't forget that it's a massive setback from what president [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=763.4s)]
*  Trump did last night. The change in the nature of the Iranian capability to launch or build a [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=768.36s)]
*  nuclear weapon is now enormous. Do you think it's a bad idea to remove Iran's nuclear capabilities? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=773.4s)]
*  Yes. It's fucking insane. What are you talking about? Yes. Iran has every right. Iran has every [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=777.64s)]
*  right to have as a sovereign nation state. Iran has every fucking right to, to have a nuclear program [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=784.6s)]
*  mostly diminished as a result of what the Israelis have done over the last nine days and what the [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=792.36s)]
*  United States of America did that it only could do last night. Mr. Secretary, I want to ask you [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=796.92s)]
*  about this operation and it's what our colleague here, Jen Griffin, says maybe one of the most [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=802.5999999999999s)]
*  remarkable operational security feats pulled off. We of course learned from the tracking of B2s [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=809.88s)]
*  headed to Guam West, but it appears the real package delivered flew east, made this 30 hour [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=817.24s)]
*  round trip and no one knew about it. What are your thoughts on that? Yeah, Bravo. Well done. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=824.36s)]
*  Hard to do in Washington DC to keep a narratives from leaking, storylines from leaking. The [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=829.48s)]
*  administration did a truly, truly good work. I think there was strategic campaign as well, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=833.5600000000001s)]
*  misinformation, right? To move those bombers to Guam. I think, by the way, I think it sent a [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=838.6s)]
*  message to the Chinese Communist Party too. You might want to stay out of this. But I also think [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=843.16s)]
*  it was an effort when president Trump said, Hey, you've got up to two weeks. I think he heard from [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=848.2s)]
*  the Iranians. They weren't remotely interested in negotiating seriously. And he said, no, we're [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=852.76s)]
*  going to move quickly. We're going to do the necessary. We're going to make sure they don't [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=856.12s)]
*  have this capability. And so I think this was a incredibly strategic operation. And I think both [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=859.4s)]
*  the Russians and the Chinese now understand that president Trump is not president Biden. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=864.4399999999999s)]
*  And not only did we make the world safer in the specific with respect to this Iranian threat, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=869.64s)]
*  but president Trump has grabbed the peace through strength mantra, the peace through strength model [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=874.52s)]
*  that President Reagan so expertly wielded. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjMsUq6ehc&t=879.08s)]
