# Hamas Must Name Hostages Or Face Confrontation: Netanyahu | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA)
*  I don't know. I don't know if Benjamin and I was trying to desperately a hold on to his [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=0.0s)]
*  coalition by like actively lying to people, or if he's being honest about it. The problem [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=4.72s)]
*  with Israel is you never know. You never know. It's just, it's, it's very hard to, to figure [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=9.6s)]
*  out exact. I mean, I know what they want to do. They want to keep bombing and they want [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=15.94s)]
*  to permanently annex the Gaza strip or at least the Northern Gaza strip, right? Everything [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=19.32s)]
*  north of the netzerim corridor. They want to permanently annex and then bring in settlers [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=25.0s)]
*  and [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=29.32s)]
*  President Zelensky. I knew it. I knew it, brother. President zel Disney. That's right. We elected [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=30.32s)]
*  him as president. We elected him as president. It was a setup. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=42.72s)]
*  Biden, but also the incoming administration under president's elect Trump. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=47.44s)]
*  You hear that? Zeland Trump. I rest my case. I rest my case. MSN, DNC. What do they know? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=52.48s)]
*  What do they know? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=61.8s)]
*  Played in bringing this deal about. Take a listen to what he had to say. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=63.28s)]
*  Both president Trump and president Biden have provided full backing to Israel's right to [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=67.2s)]
*  resume fighting, to resume combat. If Israel reaches the conclusion that the negotiations [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=73.44s)]
*  stage are pointless. I truly appreciate that. I also appreciate the decision of president [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=80.12s)]
*  Trump to lift. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=86.12s)]
*  It's so funny. He's like, bro, please. I promise I'm going to keep deciding Palestinian children. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=87.72s)]
*  Please stop yelling at me. I promise I'm never going to stop deciding Palestinian children. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=94.72s)]
*  Come on. Come on. Please, please, please, please, please. I'm going to do it. I'm going [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=101.16s)]
*  to do it in the second stage. Like as soon as they give me the hostages, dude, I'm going [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=105.56s)]
*  to go back to deciding children instantly. How warped morally a society has to get for [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=110.4s)]
*  this to be the way that you plea to your, you know, to your population. Take a second [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=118.16s)]
*  and change those B ball shorts, bro. Those shorts must smell crazy, bro. No, actually, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=124.36s)]
*  I didn't even sweat when I played basketball. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=129.76s)]
*  All the remaining restrictions on the providing of essential munitions and weapons to the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=132.04s)]
*  state of Israel. If we need to resume combat, we will do so in new ways and we will do so [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=138.64s)]
*  with tremendous force. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=145.64s)]
*  Now Netanyahu talked about resuming combat. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=148.16s)]
*  The trade is all but admitted. The coalition is only interested in permanent. There's a [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=151.79999999999998s)]
*  massive disconnect between Israeli coalition position about defeating Hamas slash resuming [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=155.44s)]
*  the war and the ceasefire endorsed by Americans. The three phase deal is meant to eventually [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=158.72s)]
*  end the war, not simply pause the fighting according to us officials. It's not a massive [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  disconnect. They're just actively trying to lie to the public again with the hopes that [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=167.0s)]
*  when there is like a little bit of ceasefire that endures and they can take out as many [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=172.76s)]
*  hostages as possible. And then Israel goes back to a permanent annexation of North Gaza. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=176.8s)]
*  Then you know, they'll be able to do it and we'll just like pass the buck. People will [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=184.8s)]
*  just not pay that much attention to it. That's the goal. That's the intention. But I do think [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=188.72s)]
*  that I do think partially that like our arm, like I think our, I breaks her back. Wait, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=193.32000000000002s)]
*  why did you see an ad? Why'd you say that? Anyway, anyway, my point was my point was [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=200.32000000000002s)]
*  I forgot what my point was. Oh my God. That's right. Ad breaks are back at the top of the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=207.0s)]
*  hour and then the middle of the hour. Please subscribe for $6 or for free with the Twitch [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=211.4s)]
*  prime. If you no longer want to see those ads, just kidding. I'm not even running the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=215.16s)]
*  ads. I debated you. Polonius. Thank you for the five gifted subs. Anyway, I think that [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=218.16s)]
*  there are probably some people in the state of our, I think that Israel needs to dial [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=228.52s)]
*  it back a little bit so that they can recoup and recover. And they're just trying to take [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=232.28s)]
*  out as many hostages as possible so that they can continue the bombing process later down [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=237.04000000000002s)]
*  the line. They're trying to minimize the, the political penalties, but it doesn't even [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=240.76s)]
*  matter because Israel is also not a real democracy either. Okay. It's like America. They don't [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=246.2s)]
*  care. They're just going to keep bombing and they're going to keep hostages. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  Israeli army radio reports of several Israeli ministers, attendees, and even cabinet secretary [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=254.56s)]
*  were seen crying during yesterday's approval of the ceasefire deal. It remains unclear [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=259.28s)]
*  whether the tears were in response to the anticipated return of some Israeli hostages [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=262.58s)]
*  who have survived 15 months of Israeli attacks on the besieged territory or the emotional [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=265.7s)]
*  toll on halting the ongoing site in Gaza. Another Israeli journalist wrote last night's [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=269.18s)]
*  cabinet meeting was described by some of those present as one of the most emotional that [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=274.1s)]
*  the cabinet has ever held ministers and meeting attendees cried during the meeting. The head [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=277.94s)]
*  of the massage admitted that it was a terrible deal, but it had to be carried out given the [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=281.7s)]
*  situation we have reached a terrible deal. Americans. I'm crying. I'm crying at the thought [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=284.78000000000003s)]
*  of putting a pause on the, the execution of numerous Palestinian children, women, the [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=290.62s)]
*  death of a man. I'm crying at the prospect of not being able to bomb another hospital [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=298.18s)]
*  or a mosque after destroying virtually all of them. Okay. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=302.54s)]
*  I'm about there. And that has a lot of people very worried because as you know, Alex, in [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=306.82s)]
*  this first phase of the deal, it is only 33 of those 98 hostages who are due to come out. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=311.66s)]
*  Netanyahu has said, yeah, they're not getting back any of the other ones. If they just start [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=319.02s)]
*  bombing, by the way, repeatedly in public and in private, that he is not prepared to [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=323.26s)]
*  end this war. And that raises real questions about whether he is going to be willing to [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=329.02s)]
*  go from phase one of this deal, that six week ceasefire to phase two, which would see the [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=334.18s)]
*  war ending in its entirety and the full withdrawal from his of Israeli troops from Gaza. So many, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=339.98s)]
*  many questions hanging over this agreement right now. And as I said, less than 12 hours [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=347.14s)]
*  until it is due to go into effect. Alex. Okay. Here's Netanyahu saying that Trump [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=352.3s)]
*  emphasized them that the ceasefire is temporary and Israel will have full backing to resume [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=357.02s)]
*  the war in Gaza. He says that Trump has decided to lift all remaining restrictions on U.S. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=360.42s)]
*  munitions, allowing Israel to resume the war with tremendous force. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=363.3s)]
*  He was elected. He was completely, Trump was completely committed to the release of the [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=366.18s)]
*  hostages we spoke on Wednesday. He congratulated me on the agreement and he emphasized and [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=370.78s)]
*  rightly so that the first stage is a temporary ceasefire. This is what he said, a temporary [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=375.82s)]
*  ceasefire towards the next stages of the agreement. We are holding on to some significant assets [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=382.26s)]
*  so that we can bring back all of the hostages and in order to accomplish all the goals of [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=388.94s)]
*  the war, both present Jimmy Dora applied to what I think BB is saving face. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=394.82s)]
*  Trump and President Biden have provided full backing to Israel's right to resume a fighting [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=401.02000000000004s)]
*  to resume combat. If Israel reaches the conclusion that the negotiations over the second stage [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=407.86s)]
*  are pointless. I don't know. I don't know if Benjamin Netanyahu is trying to desperately [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=413.86s)]
*  hold on to his coalition by like actively lying to people or if he's being honest about [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=419.34000000000003s)]
*  it. The problem with Israel is you never know. You never know. It's just, it's, it's very [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=424.5s)]
*  hard to, to figure out exact. I mean, I know what they want to do. They want to keep bombing [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=429.3s)]
*  and they want to permanently annex the Gaza strip or at least the Northern Gaza strip, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=434.70000000000005s)]
*  right? Everything Northern and that's the room corridor. They want to permanently annex [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=439.54s)]
*  and then bring in settlers and resettle that much. I do know like that's very obviously [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=443.5s)]
*  a goal and it's not just the goal of like it to our Ben Gavir. It's certainly a goal [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=449.58000000000004s)]
*  that I think the broader Israeli government also maintains. But as far as, as far as like [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=454.7s)]
*  what Benjamin and I was communicating right now, do I think that the ceasefire will hold? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=460.54s)]
*  I don't know. It's entirely dependent on Donald Trump and that's terrifying because Donald [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=464.5s)]
*  Trump is no friend of the Palestinians. Donald Trump is no friend of the Palestinians. Donald [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=469.3s)]
*  Trump's base of support or evangelicals. They are the most rabid pro-Israel people in America. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=472.98s)]
*  They outflank Zionist Jewish people in America by a wide margin. They have much larger numbers [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=478.62s)]
*  and they're significantly more rabid about Israel's settlement project. So those two [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=486.62s)]
*  things, especially paired up with the Mary Maddison giving Donald Trump a hundred million [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=492.53999999999996s)]
*  dollars to permanently annex the West bank leads me to believe that Trump might've given [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=496.78s)]
*  additional assurances. Uh-oh haters going to clip. Wait, what? Why there are Zionist [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=502.06s)]
*  Jews and anti-Zionist Jews. The most rabid Zionists in this country are Zionist evangelicals, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=506.98s)]
*  evangelical Christian Zionists. They also fund the overwhelming majority of settlement [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=515.5s)]
*  projects in Israel. This is just the truth. They're psychotic. That's why Mike Huckabee [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=520.9s)]
*  being the envoy is a massive deal. The ambassador to Israel being a massive deal. Okay. It [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=526.0600000000001s)]
*  just shows what your intentions are. It shows, uh, it shows what the American government's [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=533.22s)]
*  priorities are or what the incoming administration's priorities are. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=538.4200000000001s)]
*  Truly appreciate that. I also appreciate the decision of president Trump to lift all the [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=542.46s)]
*  remaining restrictions on the providing of essential munitions and weapons to the state [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=547.74s)]
*  of Israel. If we need to resume combat, we will do so in new ways and we will do so with [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=554.1s)]
*  tremendous force. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=561.4599999999999s)]
*  Netanyahu promised to Bezalel Smotrich that Israel will be able to occupy the entire strip. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=563.06s)]
*  Yeah. Israel's finance minister Bezalel Smotrich says Gaza is destroyed and broken, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=567.74s)]
*  uninhabitable, and it will remain so. Do not be impressed by the forces cries, the force [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=571.2199999999999s)]
*  cries of joy of our enemies. This is an animalistic society which sanctifies death and dances on the [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=575.14s)]
*  ruins of its life very soon. Like, I mean, he is such an obvious Nazi. I don't know what to [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=580.5799999999999s)]
*  say. I mean, he's literally said he's a f***ing fascist. I don't know what else to say about [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=586.5799999999999s)]
*  Bezalel Smotrich. Like, he is so openly evil. He's like routinely said he is an evil person. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=591.02s)]
*  He's the he's the one type of Nazi that's like, I know I'm a bad guy as a Nazi and I like it. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=597.62s)]
*  OK, like at least the other guys are like, no, how dare you call me a Nazi? That's like, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCerxWy07bA&t=603.38s)]
