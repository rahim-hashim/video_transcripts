# The Documentary About The Palestinian Resistance | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec)
*  Zero also released a documentary and includes clips of sin war in the frontlines of Gaza. I saw that yes in war [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=0.0s)]
*  then that one is also especially interesting because the YS in war situation is especially interesting because [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=6.48s)]
*  Israel routinely lied and said like oh [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=12.94s)]
*  He's chained with like 20 Israeli babies around him like at all times so that Israel doesn't kill him and [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=15.6s)]
*  I always thought that was laughable for two reasons [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=22.92s)]
*  There is also this drop site news no other land 2024 document directed by Palestinian Israeli collective highlighting the Palestinian resistance [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=30.4s)]
*  Against Israeli military occupation and settlement expansion in Masafari out the West Bank has just been nominated for an Oscar [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  For best documentary feature at the 97th Academy Awards now. This is a unique moment where I have not won but two [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  Documentaries that I am in the tank for [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=55.0s)]
*  Okay, oh Union is not nominated never mind. Okay. Well, then this is the one that we're going for boys. Let's watch [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=57.56s)]
*  I [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=65.1s)]
*  Was in Palestinians face one of the single biggest expulsion decisions since the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories began [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=70.89999999999999s)]
*  Hi, I'm [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=85.22s)]
*  In it [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=88.02s)]
*  еRYOTTA [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=90.5s)]
*  This is the movie that kicked off the German club partied incident. I don't know what that [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=117.22s)]
*  is. Is that the one where they got sued by the Berlin festival or something? And like [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=125.02s)]
*  one of the one of the makers of this documentary is Jewish is Israeli. The other is Palestinian [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=130.52s)]
*  less than two hours after this film was nominated for an Oscar for best documented the idea [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=138.16s)]
*  of invaded Buzzer Lodge village and started searching homes. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=142.7s)]
*  From my experience as a former IDF soldier. This looks like a lot of the common idea of [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=145.26s)]
*  command demonstrating our presence. Yeah. I think it's just to apply pressure and to [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=147.89999999999998s)]
*  say like you're done. You're cooked for person team to Israeli to Palestinian young people. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=152.7s)]
*  They filmed this under harrowing circumstances. Literally. I mean, understandably and, and [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=158.57999999999998s)]
*  I'm pretty sure. Oh yeah. Yeah. This is the, this is the club tied. Okay. Now I get it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=165.34s)]
*  You meant by the clap up tied. Okay. Yes. So what happened is the German minister tweeted [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=172.82000000000002s)]
*  that she clapped only for the Israeli and not for the Palestinian. Like she had to come [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=179.06s)]
*  out and release a statement saying she clapped after this, but specifically for the Israeli [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=184.22s)]
*  like I, the moral bankruptcy of Western leadership in full display because of Palestine. It's [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=188.3s)]
*  just like, it's one of the most, it's one of the most insane things that I have encountered. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=196.8s)]
*  And I think partially it's become more glaringly obvious because of the reality that like more [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=204.72s)]
*  people are familiar with what's going on now. And I don't mean politicians, of course, because [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=212.14000000000001s)]
*  politicians are fairly knowledgeable on what goes on in Israel, right? They just choose [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=218.4s)]
*  to actively undermine the truth. But now that more of the public is aware of it, now that [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=224.64000000000001s)]
*  they are familiar with it, it's, it has caused politicians, I think to panic, it's caused [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=231.88s)]
*  politicians to panic and oftentimes genuinely showcase their, their moral ineptitude. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=238.56s)]
*  It's not just Islamophobia, but in Germany, there's a healthy dose of that. Obviously [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=246.86s)]
*  for Germans, it's a, it's a totally separate set of standards. I think there is just a [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=252.76s)]
*  spiritual problem in the hearts of modern Germans in general. So I think like Germany [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=260.03999999999996s)]
*  is in a unique case in and of itself. I've talked about it extensively time and time [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=268.15999999999997s)]
*  again, I don't even want to get into it right now, but I think it's like, it's like a collective [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=272.2s)]
*  guilt. Wait, hold on. Is German, is German collective guilt not really learning the lessons [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=279.24s)]
*  of the Holocaust adequately? I think allowing Nazis to control, especially Western Germany [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=285.71999999999997s)]
*  in the reconstruction period led by Americans allowing that to happen. Like there's so many [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=296.84s)]
*  different issues there, but yes, I'm going to do IRL in a, in a moment. Hold on. I'm [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=304.08s)]
*  waiting. This is funny. This is a funny take on American politics. Choosing between Lockheed [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=309.08s)]
*  Martin and the Ku Klux Klan every four years back and forth until the asteroid comes. That [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=312.44s)]
*  is a fantastic way to explain American politics. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=316.96s)]
*  They made the full film available to watch for free on the local call website, but you [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=320.96s)]
*  need to use a VPN to Israel, Palestine. The movie's incredible and documents the hotspot [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=323.88s)]
*  of ethnic cleansing. That is Masa Faryata extremely well. I can link if you want highly [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=327.2s)]
*  recommended. I don't think I would need a VPN. I think I could probably, if they want [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=332.08s)]
*  wide distribution of this, if they want eyeballs on this, I'm certain that they wouldn't have [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=336.03999999999996s)]
*  an issue if I watched it and I would be willing to watch it. Where are you streaming from? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=339.8s)]
*  I'm in Tokyo right now, but yeah, Al Jazeera also released a documentary and includes clips [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=343.32s)]
*  of sin war in the front lines of Gaza. I saw that Yaghi has in war. And that one is also [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=348.41999999999996s)]
*  especially interesting because the Yaya Sanmar situation is especially interesting because [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=354.08s)]
*  Israel routinely lied and said like, Oh, he's chained with like 20 Israeli babies around [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=359.79999999999995s)]
*  him like at all times so that Israel doesn't kill him. And I always thought that was laughable [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=365.23999999999995s)]
*  for two reasons. One, because it demonstrates its projection as always, as the case always [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=371.28s)]
*  with Israel, its projection because like that's basically an admission that that is what like [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=376.23999999999995s)]
*  Benjamin and Yahoo would do if the roles were reversed or Israeli leadership would do that [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=382.32s)]
*  if roles were reversed. And the second thing that I always thought was really funny about [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=386.96s)]
*  that lie was the idea that like Israel would be above killing 20 of its hostages if they [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=392.08s)]
*  100% got an assurance that Yaya Sanmar was at a location. Like what gave you that idea [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=399.52s)]
*  that Israel cares about Israeli hostages? They have made it clear time and time again [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=405.12s)]
*  throughout the last 16 months that the hostages were actually an obstacle. Okay. A mere hurdle [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=413.16s)]
*  to clear and the hostage families were a nuisance being annoying out in the public. How dare they [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=419.48s)]
*  demonstrate Benjamin and Yahoo used the Lebanese incursion invading southern Lebanon to literally [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=426.20000000000005s)]
*  stop protests in Israel. Okay. He used that as a reason to stop all gatherings for more than like [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=433.88s)]
*  10 people in Israel for a period of time. So in the endless well of extremity that is Israeli [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=443.71999999999997s)]
*  politics, I always thought it was really funny where, you know, there was this notion that [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=451.08s)]
*  Yaya Sanmar was in a bunker somewhere safe, in a bunker somewhere safe and safe and sound with like [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=456.68s)]
*  20 hostages like protecting himself. He's selfish. He does not care about the lives of Palestinians [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=464.28000000000003s)]
*  in general. This is a common attitude that many people initially had in the aftermath of October 7th, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=472.12s)]
*  specifically a lot of like more liberal Zionists, both in the United States of America and certainly [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=477.72s)]
*  in certainly in Israel as well, where it was like, Oh, Hamas doesn't care about the safety [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=484.2s)]
*  and security of Palestinian citizens. Obviously like you don't understand if they, if they did, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=489.56s)]
*  they wouldn't put their lives on the line. They wouldn't bargain with them. Meanwhile, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=493.47999999999996s)]
*  Israel was the one that was killing the Palestinians. So I always was like, okay, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=499.08s)]
*  if that's the bargain, then, you know, peaceful conciliation in this situation would probably [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=502.76s)]
*  immediately lead to a revolution against the leadership, right? That's what would happen. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=509.32s)]
*  If people would far prefer Israeli leadership, the Palestinian people, I mean, especially in Gaza [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=515.48s)]
*  to Hamas, then yeah, they would in, if Israel just didn't kill a bunch of Palestinians, maybe they [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=520.6800000000001s)]
*  would revolt against Hamas. Now it was probably a major own goal, right? When Israel actually in the, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=526.44s)]
*  in the ways that it often does, tried to humiliate Yahya Sinwar and humiliate the Palestinians and [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=535.32s)]
*  humiliate the Palestinian resistance once again, by showcasing his final moments and his dead body [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=543.32s)]
*  and all this stuff. Meanwhile, it, it made it impossible to propagandize him as a coward [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=548.36s)]
*  because it went against all of the previous things that they had said about him, that he died [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=557.32s)]
*  fighting, you know, till the very last breath, like he literally lost his arm to a tank shell [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=564.36s)]
*  and, and they didn't even know that they had killed them. So they ended up martyring him further. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=570.12s)]
*  And, and I think that, I mean, it's just, it, this is unstable in general, like Israel's, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=575.96s)]
*  like no fascist leadership can ever maintain stability because there's a constant out group [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=582.76s)]
*  that you must be battling, right? And that's why everyone always says correctly that fascism [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=588.6s)]
*  is a death cult, a suicide cult. And, but even if it wasn't the case, like Israel certainly is [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=593.4s)]
*  going through that same exact process right now where they're actively trying to, they're [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=600.76s)]
*  actively trying to propagandize in a certain direction and just failing to do so. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=606.28s)]
*  This is what's happening in my village now. Soldiers are everywhere. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=623.4s)]
*  Even by the way, just so you understand, even the, the Jewish Israeli filmmakers [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=635.0s)]
*  are putting themselves in harm's way in that situation. Okay. When they're the ones who are [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=641.4s)]
*  also feeling like the IDF obviously pays more attention and is more careful with the way that [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=647.48s)]
*  they deal with the Israeli citizens that, you know, place themselves in between the IDF and [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=655.08s)]
*  the Palestinians in the West bank. But even then, even then it's not, it's no different than a cop. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=662.6800000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? In the United States of America, maybe even more dangerous in some instances. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=667.96s)]
*  What are you talking about? Time fascists live for 20 years and only disappear because of the [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=677.48s)]
*  war. Same for Spain. Fascism is not racist itself. Wait, what fascism it, what fascism? It's not [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=684.9200000000001s)]
*  racist itself. What are you talking about? Italian fascism live for 20 years. It only disappeared [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=692.44s)]
*  because of the war. First of all, it's pretty funny to say that fascism disappeared in Italy [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=695.64s)]
*  when, you know, Maloney is your leadership currently. Okay. And the notion that like [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=701.72s)]
*  fascism can exist without inevitably collapsing is a shocking thing to say, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=709.24s)]
*  unless you are a delusional fascist. Okay. It can be propped up. It can be extended with a [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=716.12s)]
*  lifeline, oftentimes with international support. And I wouldn't say that it will collapse in and of [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=724.04s)]
*  itself without any resistance, but these kinds of actions actually create resistance inherently, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=732.68s)]
*  understandably, just like October 7, because when you show people that there is no peaceful [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=739.4s)]
*  path forward and that you are going to, you, you are just simply going to keep killing them over [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=747.56s)]
*  and over again in this like slow death spiral in this, in this slow burn of ethnic cleansing, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=752.76s)]
*  then yeah, inevitably people are going to understand that lesson and, and, and be backed [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0917Cnxec&t=763.08s)]
