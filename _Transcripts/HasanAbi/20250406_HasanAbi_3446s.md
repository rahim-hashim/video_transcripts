# Israel Lies About Everything | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [April 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k)
*  You shouldn't even be out in the real world without adult medical supervision at every [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=0.0s)]
*  stage. You will have to be the dumbest person on the planet to be like, Oh, I can't believe [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Israel lied again. Like, what are you doing? Where is it? Where is it? Oh, damn it. There [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=11.36s)]
*  was one title that was just like the most in, Oh dude, this, I mean, this is the Jerusalem [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=23.16s)]
*  post, right? Like they're, they are, I mean, look at this IDF tries to reset narrative [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=29.24s)]
*  on mistaken killing of 14, gauze and aid workers, bro. At that point, just don't even try. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=36.0s)]
*  I don't know what you're doing. Like what, what does this mean? What does anything mean? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=42.28s)]
*  What does anything mean? What is this title, bro? You are, I like that. I mean, look, the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=50.4s)]
*  Jerusalem post obviously is, is uniquely bad. So they're not in the business of like educating [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=58.239999999999995s)]
*  people on the truth at all. And this kind of stuff is, is this kind of stuff basically [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=63.879999999999995s)]
*  proves, Oh, this is what I was looking for. This was the original. This was the original [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=70.44s)]
*  title. What is happening to the English language? IDF tries to reset mistaken killing of 14 [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=75.32s)]
*  Red Cross workers. IDF tries to reset narrative on mistaken killing of 14 gauze and aid workers. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=82.88s)]
*  What does that mean? What, what like tries to reset? Like they try to bring him back [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=88.08s)]
*  alive. Is that what happened? Anyway, we're obviously going to cover this. Hold on. Let [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=92.36s)]
*  me see if I can find the, I'm going to see if there's a playlist or not. If not, I'm [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=96.44s)]
*  just going to pull some up because I have to go pee real quick as well. Immediately. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  As soon as I start streaming, I'm like, as soon as I start streaming, I have to piss. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=110.75999999999999s)]
*  I have to rip up. He was crazy. Go piss girl. Oh no, I'm, I'm gonna, I'm gonna. All right. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=115.48s)]
*  I found it. Here it is. Israel admits mistake over medic killings in Gaza. We're obviously [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=121.72s)]
*  going to start with that. Here it is. This is not exactly a fun story to start off with, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=128.84s)]
*  but it's a very important one. And I think the, my coverage on this is, is not just going [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=137.48000000000002s)]
*  to talk about the atrocities, but instead I'm going to be talking about the Western [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=143.84s)]
*  reception and the media criticism side of this, because it's a, it's yet another disgusting [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=147.76s)]
*  story that you guys are familiar with. And there's a lot of insanity that is, that revolves [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=153.96s)]
*  around the story. So I'm going to pee real quick. And then [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=162.8s)]
*  Speaker 2nd Speaker 1st 3rd... Has admitted it. Soldiers made mistakes over the killing [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=164.76s)]
*  of 15 emergency workers in Gaza last month, which sparked international outrage. Mobile [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=168.88s)]
*  phone footage that emerged forced Israel to change its account of what caused its troops [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=174.68s)]
*  to open fire on the rescue workers. The Israeli army said the convoy had been approaching [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=179.6s)]
*  suspiciously without headlights or flashing lights. A military official has now admitted [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=185.0s)]
*  that was inaccurate. Dan Johnson reports. And a warning, you may find some of the footage [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=190.28s)]
*  distressing. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=195.4s)]
*  This video challenges Israel's account of why its soldiers opened fire with such deadly [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=198.48s)]
*  force. It's just before dawn and the red Crescent paramedics and civil defense workers are answering [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=203.72s)]
*  a call to help the wounded near Raffa. Israel's military first said this convoy advanced suspiciously [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=209.56s)]
*  towards troops with the lights switched off. But you can see these are marked vehicles [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=216.32s)]
*  uniforms. Then without warning this, the shooting continues for more than five minutes. The [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=223.12s)]
*  paramedic who's filming says his last prayers. Refat read one. His last words were praying [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=236.12s)]
*  to God and then and then saying, hold on, I'm just going to give you the actual last [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=245.96s)]
*  words. Hold on. I don't want to mess it up. I don't want to paraphrase it or anything [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=253.28s)]
*  like that. He says, forgive me, mother. This is the path I chose to help people. He was [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=256.36s)]
*  found in a mass grave with a bullet inside his head alongside all of the other paramedics [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=262.08s)]
*  alongside all of the other Red Cross workers. Israel had buried them and the ambulances [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=271.16s)]
*  as well in an effort to hide it. And predictably Israel did the exact same things that they [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=277.52000000000004s)]
*  do. Number one, Israel does not mention any of the atrocities or even run defense for [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=283.52000000000004s)]
*  that it commits normally until Western media starts making a fuss about one of the horrible [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=294.92s)]
*  acts that it is committed on a daily basis. Okay. They do stuff like this all the time. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=305.12s)]
*  We cover it here all the time. Our coverage on this, of course, is not the same as the [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=311.32s)]
*  New York Times covering it or CNN talking about it. Okay. The only reason why you're [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=315.8s)]
*  even hearing about this story or Israel responding to the story by lying is because they had [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=321.44s)]
*  to respond to it. And once they respond to any of the horrible actions that they're engaging [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=328.32s)]
*  in, the playbook is always the same. First, they say they were Hamas. Then more evidence [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=336.44s)]
*  comes out. Then they say, okay, maybe they weren't Hamas. We mistakenly thought that [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=345.28s)]
*  they look like Hamas. Then more evidence comes out. They say, okay, even the footage itself [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=351.84s)]
*  shows that there was not even a single piece of evidence that could lead us to believe [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=358.52s)]
*  that they were in any way, shape or form remotely suspicious. Okay. Yeah. They just lie about [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=361.59999999999997s)]
*  like they lie about the most basic shit. They lied in this situation saying like the ambulances [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=368.67999999999995s)]
*  did not have their lights on. They were moving in a suspicious way. There was a Hamas militant [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=374.34s)]
*  in the ambulance. They just lie about everything, every part of this. And then when that also, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=378.34s)]
*  when when that also is directly contradicted by the truth, they turn around and they go, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=385.06s)]
*  okay, we're going to investigate ourselves. It was a mistake. That's the final stage. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=389.9s)]
*  And then months later, when people follow up, they either say, yeah, we're still conducting [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=395.41999999999996s)]
*  an investigation or never conclude the investigation. Or if they do conclude the investigation, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=399.44s)]
*  they'll say, sorry, we're not going to punish the people. Basically a tap on the wrist at [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=405.0s)]
*  most. That is literally the only thing that ever fucking happens. Okay. And I tweeted [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=410.52s)]
*  about this earlier today. I was like, look, if this is new to you, that Israel lied again, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=419.82s)]
*  Israel one engaged in a, a, a horrifying act of violence that you read about in history [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=426.8s)]
*  books and then directly lied about it. And this is shocking to you. Then you shouldn't [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=435.28000000000003s)]
*  be a journalist. Like this is not, you shouldn't even be out in the real world without adult [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=441.8s)]
*  medical supervision at every stage. You will have to be the dumbest person on the planet [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=448.24s)]
*  to be like, Oh, I can't believe Israel lied again. Like, what are you doing? What are [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=454.0s)]
*  you fucking doing? I tweet. I say, if Israel isn't lying about a horrific atrocity, that [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=458.88s)]
*  means the Western legacy press hasn't even covered it enough that it warrants them lying [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=464.16s)]
*  about it. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=468.06s)]
*  Any journalist that's still surprised by Israel lying to them is either the biggest dumb ass, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=469.06s)]
*  a career is Charlotte and or both it's crazy. Oh yeah. The other side of the story is they'll [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=472.36s)]
*  say, what about Syria or your anti-Semitic for even criticizing Israel every step of [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=478.15999999999997s)]
*  the way Israel? I know we lied about the ambulance workers, Shiva hospital, flower massacre, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=484.24s)]
*  beheaded babies, Hamas hospital, Hind Rajab, the terrorist days of the week, world central [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=488.96s)]
*  kitchen workers, babies in ovens, white phosphorus, deliberately starving, Gazan, Sinwar surrounding [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=494.15999999999997s)]
*  himself with 20 hostages in a tunnel, gassing hostages, the Al Ahly hospital, killing women [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=499.46s)]
*  and children with white flags, mass raping Palestinians, non-existent tunnels under graveyards, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=505.34s)]
*  Nasser hospital, who some Abu Safi, a mass graves, snipers, targeting kids in the head, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=510.98s)]
*  providing protection to criminal gangs, the loot aid, wiping out Gaza who refused slash [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=517.22s)]
*  collapse. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=521.78s)]
*  This who refused slash collapse. The ceasefire Israel did blowing up and then lied and said [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=522.78s)]
*  it was Hamas blowing up the Gazans fleeing South Kamala Duane hospital, claiming dead [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=527.4s)]
*  Gazan children are dolls, creating safe zones. The generals plan how many Hamas militants [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=531.3s)]
*  were killed. Red Crescent taking part in October seven, calling killed journalists, Hamas militants, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=536.2199999999999s)]
*  Mohammed Abu Salmiya, the Indonesian hospital, onra, al-auda hospital, killing women, sheltering [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=540.9399999999999s)]
*  a church, bombing the church, destroying every single Gaza University, the Turkish cancer [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=545.9799999999999s)]
*  hospital, Hamas hiding giant stockpiles of fuel in Rafa, finding active smuggling tunnels [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=550.26s)]
*  in Rafa, hostages returning pregnant, who killed Yossi Sharabi, Itai Svirsky, Nick Baser, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=554.66s)]
*  Ron Sherman, Elia Toledano. Every single thing that Israel says is a lie. It is infinitely. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=561.02s)]
*  I mean, look, you can count the times that Israel is being truthful in one hand as opposed [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=568.26s)]
*  to every single that they say it's single thing that they say. Now, this is not just [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=575.66s)]
*  Israel. Every government lies. Okay. Of course, every government lies. The American government [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=579.98s)]
*  goddamn time to the difference between Israel and the United States of America, at least [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=586.04s)]
*  the lies that they've told in the past and the lies that they kind of continue to tell [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=592.1999999999999s)]
*  now the difference between Israel and America is that because there is such an airtight [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=596.8399999999999s)]
*  consent manufacturing machine due to Israel's aligned interests with the American state [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=604.2399999999999s)]
*  department that they don't even see the need to lie in a sophisticated manner. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=609.0s)]
*  There's two factors at play here. One, the severity of the violence makes it virtually [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=615.08s)]
*  impossible to lie about or impossible to turn a blind eye to because they are so horny for [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=620.44s)]
*  bloodshed. So incredibly, there's so much appetite for bloodshed, both in Israel and [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=626.6s)]
*  the IDF is demonstrating that bloodshed on a daily basis. Okay. But on top of that, there is [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=633.8000000000001s)]
*  not really any mechanism of pushback. There's no interest in covering this issue truthfully, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=641.48s)]
*  because it's all the way over there from Western media in general, when they lie, there's rarely [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=646.2800000000001s)]
*  ever any pushback. This is one of the few instances of documented lies that Israel is partook in, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=652.0400000000001s)]
*  in an effort to defend again, something indefensible. And everyone is acting like [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=661.8s)]
*  they're so shocked by this. Like I saw Barack ravied covering this in Hebrew, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=668.04s)]
*  talking about how, how much shame Israel has brought, how much shame the IDF and the Israeli [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=674.12s)]
*  officials are brought to the great Jewish state because they've really, they've really broken the [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=679.16s)]

*  And it blows my mind. Cause it's like, it's not even any different. What do you mean? They did up. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=691.24s)]
*  It's not like they've ever seen any repercussions. What would the, why, why would their expectations [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=695.08s)]
*  be any different this time? It's not the first time that they've done this. The only reason why [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=699.32s)]
*  this became story after Western press straight up omitted key details from this issue by refusing [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=704.84s)]
*  to talk to the Palestinian red Crescent red cross workers and acting like they were inaccessible. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=714.6800000000001s)]
*  Like acting as though they could not the New York times, the paper of record could not reach out to [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=721.24s)]
*  the Palestinian red Crescent society. Like that's crazy. They were like, Oh yeah, we're just went [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=729.0s)]
*  with the Israeli government narrative because we just could not confirm nor deny or reach out to [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=733.64s)]
*  any of the fucking Palestinian red cross people and insult to the profession at a time when it [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=738.28s)]
*  is needed the most insane. The only reason why we found out about it is because they uncovered the [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=743.4s)]
*  mass graves. And after that Israel predictably lied about it and the media played along with it. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=749.0s)]
*  But this brave first responders phone camera footage was found in the aftermath that directly [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=755.08s)]
*  contradicted the Israeli narrative surrounding it. That's it. That's literally the only reason [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=765.0s)]
*  it's a miracle to the footage from the guy's phone got out. It's not a miracle. It's incompetence [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=772.28s)]
*  or rather it's not even incompetence. It's actually hubris. The Israeli [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=777.0s)]
*  terrorists that assassinated these healthcare workers didn't even go through their phones or [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=784.44s)]
*  break their phones or anything like that after assassinating them because they're like, yeah, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=789.4000000000001s)]
*  nobody cares. That's it. That's what it is. And the entitlement and the arrogance demonstrated [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=793.08s)]
*  by the Israeli state, because who's going to check them is the reason why they don't even [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=798.2s)]
*  feel the need to try and massage the narrative and just straightforwardly lie. If this footage had [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=806.1199999999999s)]
*  not come out, it wouldn't even make a blip because let me tell you something. This is not the first [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=814.5999999999999s)]
*  time they've done this. They've done this virtually every week since October 7. I mean, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=819.9599999999999s)]
*  like directly killing healthcare workers. Okay. They've done this. They've done this hundreds of [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=825.8s)]
*  times since October 7. They did this to Western aid workers. So why is that even remotely surprising [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=830.68s)]
*  that they would think that, you know, this business is usual. It is business as usual. Yeah. They did [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=838.52s)]
*  this before October 7 as well. There are mass graves all over Gaza chat. You're crazy. If you [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=843.64s)]
*  think that this is new, I can't even fault the average American for being horrified by this [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=849.3199999999999s)]
*  instance and being shocked that a foreign state would lie so openly, so deliberately [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=855.48s)]
*  without any care whatsoever. Because if you're getting, if the only news that you're hearing [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=861.32s)]
*  is from outlets, the right titles like this Israeli military changes account of [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=866.44s)]
*  Gaza paramedics killing video after video of attack or IDF, try to reset narrative. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=869.8000000000001s)]
*  I mean, this is Jerusalem post. So it's not Western press, but you know, like video footage appears to [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=874.44s)]
*  contradict the Israeli account of Gaza medic killings appears, appears to contradict like [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=879.72s)]
*  things that you can observe with your own eyes, hard data, hard evidence itself still is at odds [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=885.1600000000001s)]
*  and contradicting the statements made by the Israeli government. It's like, why is the Israeli [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=893.24s)]
*  government that is so consistently lied without in the least sophisticated ways possible as a [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=899.1600000000001s)]
*  matter of fact, why is that a higher point of authority than like things that we can see and [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=906.84s)]
*  observe with our own two fucking eyes, things that we can hear. It's insane to me. It is truly an [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=912.6800000000001s)]
*  utterly insane that even when you can see something visually visual evidence of a, of a instance of, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=920.36s)]
*  of horrible executions of healthcare workers, first responders, and it's still at odds with [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=928.0400000000001s)]
*  the Israeli government statements on it. So that has a higher point of authority here. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=935.24s)]
*  It's like straight up 1984. Don't believe your lying eyes. This is the reason why people are [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=940.84s)]
*  oblivious. And even in spite of this media blockade, okay. In spite of the media's best [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=946.12s)]
*  attempts, the Western media's best attempts, people are still aware of at least a fraction [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=954.36s)]
*  of the cruelty and the limited amount of cruelty that they see is enough for them to go, this [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=959.72s)]
*  is fucking insane. What are we doing? One of 15 killed his phone was found with his body [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=965.08s)]
*  and he recorded the whole event. His last words before being shot, forgive me, mom. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=973.72s)]
*  I just wanted to help people. I wanted to save lives. The footage only emerged when teams could [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=986.6s)]
*  safely reach this site seven days later. The bodies were buried along with the vehicles. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=994.04s)]
*  Regular practice, the army says to protect them from animals. The UN called this a mass grave. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1000.36s)]
*  Israel's account was already in question. The only paramedic to live through the shooting [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1007.3199999999999s)]
*  told us earlier this week they had their lights on and it was clear they were medics. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1011.9599999999999s)]
*  I am the only survivor who saw what happened to my colleagues and I will expose the crimes [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1018.92s)]
*  committed by the occupation against them. On Tuesday, Israel's response was in defense of [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1023.4s)]
*  its forces. The IDF did not randomly attack an ambulance. Last Sunday, several [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1029.0s)]
*  uncoordinated vehicles were identified advancing suspiciously toward IDF troops without. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1038.36s)]
*  Oh my bad, big mistake. We made a big mistake, guys. It's not a mistake. You're ethnically [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1047.08s)]
*  cleansing the strip. It's a killing field. It's not a mistake. This is also a lie. When they say [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1053.24s)]
*  this is a mistake. No, the mistake is you foolishly thought that people would not uncover the mass [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1060.2s)]
*  graves that you had put forth. And then also on top of that, you thought that the Western media [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1068.44s)]
*  wouldn't care about the story as much, or you thought that even if they did care about the story, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1074.84s)]
*  there wouldn't be any real footage, any real evidence, hard evidence beyond [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1080.36s)]
*  firsthand accounts of Palestinians, which obviously nobody fucking cares about because [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1085.6399999999999s)]
*  Palestinians are not seen as human beings in Western media. Yeah. It's not random. It's [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1088.84s)]
*  indiscriminate. Exactly. Indiscriminate killing is the policy here. And therefore it has a capacity [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1092.4399999999998s)]
*  to look random. If you don't recognize what's going on to the onlooker, to the onlooker from [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1099.4799999999998s)]
*  afar, you're like, Oh, well, this seems like a big mistake. They didn't even like, it's not like [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1106.28s)]
*  they bombed them. They shot them directly. They assassinated these people. They executed them. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1110.36s)]
*  The only reason why it looks disorganized is because you can't have complete command over all [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1115.32s)]
*  of your troops and give them the directive to ethnically cleanse people. And even then, sometimes [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1121.08s)]
*  they do like the Goulani brigades and whatnot. Okay. But this is how, this is how you unfold [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1126.44s)]
*  ethnic cleansing systematize process, ethnic cleansing in a way that looks disorganized and [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1133.4s)]
*  disordered because you're just letting them do whatever they want to do and showing them that [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1139.16s)]
*  there is no accountability internally within the military structure. If they knew what they were, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1144.52s)]
*  if they knew that what they had done was appropriate, they wouldn't have fucking buried [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1148.52s)]
*  the ambulances by the way. Yeah. And it's the Israel has responded to the footage showing its [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1152.44s)]
*  forces killing on clearly marked ambulances on Rafa on March 23rd. The military said Goulani [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1157.64s)]

*  briefing troops before the operation. Here are some of the words that this brigade had said, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1170.6s)]
*  everyone you meet is an enemy. You recognize a person open fire, eliminate them and move on. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1176.44s)]
*  Why we create immense military pressure. We kill a lot of enemies, take a lot of their land. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1181.48s)]
*  That's how the hostages are returned to this point. Everyone you meet is an enemy. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1198.2s)]
*  You recognize a person, you open fire, eliminate and move on. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1202.76s)]
*  Don't get confused on the subject. I've never seen, I've never seen a situation [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1206.6s)]
*  where they so clearly detail all of this out, where they so clearly detail it out. They're like, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1215.8s)]
*  this is an ethnic cleansing. This is a genocide. We're doing a genocide. We love doing ethnic [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1222.28s)]
*  cleansing. Here's how you are going to do the ethnic cleansing. You're going to kill every [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1226.52s)]
*  single person that you see. It does not matter. Kill them dead over and over again. And people [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1230.36s)]
*  are still like, I don't know, man. I really want to feel like Israel's in the right here. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1235.96s)]
*  So your statements are actually hurting my feelings. And so I'm going to cynically claim [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1241.72s)]

*  terrorists are not terrorists. You're a fucking dumb ass. Do you think the Nazis were the terrorists [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1314.28s)]
*  or the resistance networks that tried to fight back against them? Well, considering you're a [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1320.52s)]
*  fucking Nazi right now, you probably would defend the Nazi regime as well in that process. You'd be [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1325.96s)]
*  like, yeah, these, these Jews should not have been resisting. Why'd they do the Warsaw ghetto [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1332.04s)]

*  I don't know what case you're referring to, but [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1419.88s)]
*  so Hamas killing innocent civilians is okay. Did I say that? Where's that chatter? [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1423.96s)]
*  Damn, you guys are clapping them real quick before I can even respond, dude. It's so, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1429.32s)]
*  it's so instructive that Israel slaughtering Red Cross medical workers and then putting them [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1434.1200000000001s)]

*  your fucking dense skull. Okay. Israel is a million times worse than Hamas. Do you understand? [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1464.12s)]
*  Mathematically, Israel is insanely, like it's not even on the same moral playing field to begin with. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1470.92s)]
*  Israel is the reason why Hamas is a militant resistance group. Because of this shit. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1479.5600000000002s)]
*  Because Israel has been doing this for 76 years. You're out of your fucking mind. What are we [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1486.6000000000001s)]

*  Hamas? What about Hamas? Israel's done an October 7, virtually every week since October 7. What do [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1500.52s)]
*  you mean? What about October 7? What about the following week of October 7 and the week after, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1507.8s)]
*  and the week after, the 17 months after October 7? And you're still fucking talking about October [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1514.12s)]
*  7. You're out of your goddamn mind, dude. Shut the fuck up. Israel was doing October 7 shit, [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1519.96s)]
*  kidnapping Palestinians illegally in illegally occupied territory in the West Bank every single [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1526.04s)]

*  7. Many people at least recognized the cruelty, recognized the process, recognized what this is, [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1539.88s)]
*  what Israel is all about after October 7. They were oblivious to it before, but it was impossible [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1548.36s)]
*  to ignore after. And it's wild to me that people still cling onto this narrative. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1556.4399999999998s)]
*  Every event that you get from Hamas, you don't take it with a grain of salt. You take it with [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1561.32s)]
*  a shovel of salt. Hamas has been spreading propaganda since day one. I'm not talking about [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1568.1999999999998s)]
*  Hamas. I'm talking about the Red Crescent. Hold on. A research center from London actually [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1574.6000000000001s)]
*  provide information and evidence how Hamas is inflating number, how they're actually reducing [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1582.04s)]
*  the age of some of the victims. You're not disputing that 15 bodies have been found, [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1589.08s)]
*  have you? And the eight of them are Red Crescent workers. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1593.24s)]
*  Look, I think that if I haven't heard about this case. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1597.32s)]
*  Oh my God. Look, every case that actually happened, we investigate in depth. Okay. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1611.32s)]
*  Oh my God. They're dude. So bad. So fucking bad. How are you this bad at your job? How are you [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1620.84s)]

*  it's a unique predicament because like, how can you be good at this? You know, God damn. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1641.8s)]
*  If there's an investigation happening regarding a case, I would be very short and very, [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1649.56s)]
*  I would be very cautious about making declarative and statements as we've heard before. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1657.08s)]
*  Freak, actual freak. I'm genuinely shocked that Jesus Christ people still shall [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1664.28s)]

*  I don't think that there are as many people as you think that are just like eating this [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1676.44s)]
*  propaganda whole. I think people are just like either oblivious or I don't know. I just, I think [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1683.3200000000002s)]
*  that I think overall people are just oblivious to it because the media just covers this in the worst [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1689.16s)]
*  way possible. And it's happening far away. Headlights. Now that narrative's been upended [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1694.28s)]
*  tonight. A military official admitted the soldiers were mistaken about the lights and the threats [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1703.72s)]
*  they were under. The army insists six of the dead belonged to Hamas, but it denies they were executed [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1709.48s)]
*  at close range. The changing- That's still a lie. It's not a changing story. They've just been lying [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1715.8s)]
*  since the beginning. I don't, they've just never stopped, they've never stopped lying. They're [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1722.44s)]
*  still lying. Oh my God. I'm losing my mind. It's only increasing the pressure. Like look, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1727.08s)]
*  media cares about media narratives. This is a major story. This is a major story. Okay. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1733.24s)]
*  The very fact that the atrocities itself is obviously a story in and of itself, [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1742.2s)]
*  but even if you're not covering the atrocity, Israel's lying is a story in and of itself. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1747.0s)]
*  Israel lying like this is a part of this story. It's just a different story. You should be like, [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1754.3600000000001s)]
*  this is so crazy that like they just make shit up completely and even when they're found, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1759.24s)]
*  they keep making shit up. They continue to make more shit up. What the fuck is happening? [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1765.0s)]
*  For an independent investigation. This footage lay buried for a week in the Gaza sand. Now it is [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1770.1200000000001s)]

*  sweeping global tariffs. Israel's itself facing a 17% levy on all goods. It had tried and failed to [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1795.56s)]
*  avoid the measures but by preemptively dropping duties on American goods affected by them. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1803.1599999999999s)]

*  the US to take control and own the Gaza Strip. Meanwhile, the British Foreign Secretary David [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1813.8799999999999s)]

*  Normally the level of credibility decreases with each lie but Israel's level of state is constant [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1827.48s)]
*  across MSM. It's because Israel is America. The only other place where the level of credibility [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1831.1599999999999s)]
*  does not decrease is the United States of America. You understand? Like at a certain point, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1836.2s)]
*  at a certain point the level of credibility for mainstream media decreases as a direct consequence [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1842.04s)]
*  of consistently defending these sorts of erroneous claims. These sorts of like open lies [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1847.72s)]
*  and that's it. So what Israel is doing will take out mainstream credibility. Like the credibility [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1855.4s)]
*  of mainstream press or what remains of the credibility of mainstream press, that's it. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1863.64s)]
*  Because it seems to me like the American government is not going to drop Israel and on top of that, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1866.8400000000001s)]

*  and vociferously. Okay? And therefore, it's going to turn into, it's going to turn into what it, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=1878.8400000000001s)]

*  it would have been impossible, pretty much. It's bait. When did you become a journalist, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2149.48s)]
*  Hassan? What did I say? I'm a journalist. I said a bunch of journalists and myself, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2155.96s)]
*  as in I'm not a journalist. What is this? What is happening? [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2162.2s)]
*  Information that he receives definitely from security authorities, as well as from the [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2167.8799999999997s)]
*  ministry of foreign affairs, some intelligence basically indicating what these MPs might be [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2171.3999999999996s)]
*  doing. But just to give some context to it, it's not the first time that Israel has done [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2177.0s)]
*  something like this to elected officials that it fears might be coming to the country to stir [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2181.3999999999996s)]
*  unrest. A few years ago, during the first Trump administration, two Democratic members of the [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2186.8399999999997s)]
*  House of Representatives, Rashida Tlaib and Yulia Omar, well-known and very vocal critics, [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2192.7599999999998s)]
*  vitriol critics of Israel, came and tried to enter the country. They were also denied entry. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2199.72s)]
*  This is something that Israel very rarely does, even when engaging with friends of it, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2204.9199999999996s)]
*  like the United States or the United Kingdom. Well, good thing that you mentioned that they [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2210.9199999999996s)]
*  have done it though. So that's weird. Kind of feels like they do that then, no? Just like, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2215.96s)]
*  oh, no, you don't understand. It's just a very rare thing that they do, even though [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2223.32s)]
*  here are instances where they have done it, just rare. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2227.7200000000003s)]
*  Andrew Smith [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2230.36s)]
*  Kingdom. So I think that what we're looking at is really between Israel's interest and of course, [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2231.96s)]
*  maintaining and preserving very important political diplomatic cultural relations with [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2237.56s)]
*  these countries, but at the same time, making sure that people like any country is allowed to [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2243.32s)]
*  prevent people from entering who are going to undermine the fabric of society and try to cause [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2248.76s)]
*  harm to the state of Israel. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2257.0s)]
*  Yulia Omar [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2258.1200000000003s)]
*  Insane. Incredible. Yeah. No, you don't get it. It's actually perfectly valid. It's perfectly [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2259.8s)]
*  valid for Israel to do this because they'll undermine the delicate fabric of Israeli society [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2265.6400000000003s)]
*  by speaking the truth. If the truth is going to undermine your delicate fabric of society, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2272.44s)]
*  then you don't deserve to have a society like that. That's my take, at least. Bullshit. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2277.7200000000003s)]
*  Yulia Omar [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2282.76s)]
*  Let's get more of this by going live to Jerusalem and join our Chief North America [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2283.96s)]
*  correspondent, Gary O'Donoghue. Gary, first of all, how, we're talking about these two [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2288.92s)]
*  British Labour MPs being denied entry on Saturday night. How is that being reported in Israel? [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2294.84s)]
*  Gary O'Donoghue [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2301.8s)]
*  Well, the facts are being reported, as you'd expect, and we've actually had some contacts, [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2304.92s)]
*  or the BBC's had some contact with one of the MPs who said they wouldn't be saying anything [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2309.5600000000004s)]
*  until they got back to the UK. I can tell you that we've just heard from the interior ministry [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2314.2000000000003s)]
*  here who say that those two MPs, and presumably, although we'll check this with their two aides, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2319.32s)]
*  left the country at 6am this morning. So that's about three hours ago. So they should be back [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2325.0800000000004s)]
*  in the UK in short order, and that's when they said they would make a statement about what had [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2331.32s)]
*  happened to them. But effectively, they were denied entry, and the Israeli authorities have [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2335.7200000000003s)]
*  been saying because they were here, not on an official delegation, which is something the foreign [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2339.7200000000003s)]
*  office has contradicted, and also because they were here, according to the Israelis, to spread [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2345.2400000000002s)]
*  hatred. We'll see what the MPs themselves have to say when they land, but this has clearly caused a [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2350.92s)]
*  lot of tension between the government in London with the foreign secretary describing it as [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2356.76s)]
*  unacceptable and saying this is no way to treat a delegation of parliamentarians. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2361.8s)]
*  Yes, the reasons given were that they intended to spread hateful rhetoric. Do we understand [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2367.6400000000003s)]
*  what they mean by that? [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2375.0s)]
*  No, we don't. There's been no elaboration on what they meant by that, and of course, [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2378.5200000000004s)]
*  that doesn't sound like something you would say if you were questioned, does it? I'm here to spread [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2381.8s)]
*  hateful rhetoric. So we'll see what their account of that interview and that interrogation was [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2386.12s)]
*  when they land, but clearly these two MPs have a background. The Israeli authorities will know [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2391.48s)]
*  that background, know what they've said on the record in parliament about Israel and about [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2397.48s)]
*  Israel's activities, and I've no doubt that will have been part of the judgment here. They will [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2402.8399999999997s)]
*  have checked these people out before they came in and made a decision that they didn't want to let [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2408.8399999999997s)]
*  them into the country. Gary, Benjamin Netanyahu, shortly on his way to Washington for a meeting [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2412.52s)]
*  with Donald Trump, what's Israel hoping to get out of that meeting? It's just, look, it's so [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2419.56s)]
*  consistent, it's so flagrant. At this stage, if you are a government that's allowing this to happen, [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2425.64s)]
*  especially when considering that Israel would not even be able to do any of this without [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2434.04s)]
*  Western support, Israel would not exist in the violent ways that it does without Western support. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2439.96s)]
*  So at this stage, if you're a government that looks at this and goes, ah, well, what are you [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2445.96s)]
*  going to do? It's just Israel being Israel. It is what it is. Or try to defend it at any capacity. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2450.04s)]
*  Or if you're an institution like the media Hassan, why is your chat so cringe and fascist pill? [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2455.16s)]
*  What are you saying? Who is fascist pill? Who says fascist pill? If you're a mainstream [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2461.0s)]
*  institution, like a mainstream media institution, and you still run defense and run cover [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2466.84s)]
*  for Israel when it's like so flagrantly and so very clearly violating norms and so arrogant and [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2472.44s)]
*  so entitled in the way that they're doing it, it is no wonder that fucking, especially when tied to [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2477.6400000000003s)]
*  the association with Judaism, the false conflation of Judaism, it's no wonder that anti-Semitism grows. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2482.6800000000003s)]
*  Like, what are you doing? You're doing David Icke style conspiracies on your own. You're like, no, [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2489.0s)]
*  no, no, the conspiracies are real. We do actually control the media. We do actually do this for [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2495.0s)]
*  Judaism. All Jews care about this over and over and over again. Of course, people are going to [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2500.2s)]
*  respond to that. Of course, people are going to respond to that be like, okay, well, now I believe [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2505.8s)]
*  you. I guess my perspective on this is different because like as someone who's lived in the United [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2510.6s)]
*  States of America, whose name is Hassan, right? It feels like, it feels like Israel's doing like [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2517.8s)]
*  pro-ISIS style commentary. The false association, the false conflation of Islam and ISIS to [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2525.96s)]
*  deliberately create Islamophobia in the West so that people would be more tolerant to all of the [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2534.44s)]
*  death and destruction overseas was done by people who weren't Muslim. But here it feels like Jews [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2542.12s)]
*  and non-Jews alike who love Israel make that conflation. Israel is exactly like ISIS. Israel [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2547.96s)]
*  operates exactly like ISIS down to the false conflation of religion. I don't know how other [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2555.16s)]
*  people don't recognize this. I don't know how they don't see it. It's like Israel's actions and its [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2561.72s)]
*  defense feel like if, you know, a lot of Muslim leaders in the West were like, you're being [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2566.52s)]
*  Islamophobic. If you, if you think what ISIS is doing is wrong, you know what I mean? Can you, [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2574.12s)]
*  can you imagine there's like people running around like Muslims themselves, not the state, [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2579.64s)]
*  not the media, because the media did make that conflation because that conflation was deliberate, [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2584.7599999999998s)]
*  methodical, helped their goals in bombing the living shit out of every fucking Muslim country. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2590.12s)]
*  It just doesn't make any sense. Well, it's his second visit, isn't it, to Washington since, [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2596.44s)]
*  since the election, since the US election or since the Donald Trump took over on the 20th of January [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2601.56s)]
*  again. Clearly trade will be an important part of that because as part of these worldwide tariffs [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2607.48s)]
*  that Donald Trump has imposed, Israel was slapped with a 17% tariff despite the fact [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2613.56s)]
*  that the government here had removed all tariffs on US goods just before Donald Trump made his [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2620.12s)]
*  announcement. So I'm sure there'll be some lobby and I think he'll want to also try to ensure that [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2626.44s)]
*  he's got the latitude to do what he wants to do in Gaza in particular with this current offensive [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2632.12s)]
*  there and creating these new, what Israel calls these new security zones in these new corridors, [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2638.36s)]
*  which is something that's come up for a lot of criticism, under a lot of criticism from [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2643.88s)]
*  the UN and other international players and organizations. Benjamin Netanyahu will want [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2647.7200000000003s)]
*  to know that he's still got Donald Trump's backing in that regard, that regard as well. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2653.96s)]
*  And finally, Gary, we're also, we've had the reports from the Israeli military admitting [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2659.0s)]
*  that its initial accounts of what happened when- [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2664.2000000000003s)]
*  You're not being annoying. I'm very familiar with forensicarchitecture.org, okay? It is a resource [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2666.6s)]
*  that I'm very familiar with. They did great work on the Al Ahly bombing and I've used them in the [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2671.56s)]
*  past and I've talked about them many times over. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2676.92s)]
*  ...emergency workers were killed on March the 23rd. They've admitted mistakes in those initial [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2679.48s)]
*  accounts. What do we understand actually did take place? [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2685.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, in some sense, they've been forced to admit these are mistakes because a video emerged [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2691.7200000000003s)]
*  yesterday which showed these vehicles, these ambulances and a fire truck approaching- [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2695.24s)]
*  Words don't have any meaning anymore, dude. A mistake implies that you didn't intend to [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2703.24s)]
*  assassinate these healthcare workers. A mistake implies that you don't want to do it again. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2710.9199999999996s)]
*  What Israel did to the healthcare workers is not a mistake. It's just regular process. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2717.3999999999996s)]
*  That's it. And they've done it every single day. This is not the first time this has happened. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2723.3199999999997s)]
*  I cannot stress this enough. Israel has killed hundreds of healthcare workers. Israel's tortured [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2729.3199999999997s)]
*  doctors kidnapped them and tortured them. The mistake is that they got caught. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2736.04s)]
*  ...where their occupants were actually killed with all their lights on and with their signals [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2742.3599999999997s)]
*  flashing. Now, the Israeli authorities had originally said that they were acting to stop [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2747.3199999999997s)]
*  suspiciously. They had no lights on, no emergency signals flashing. And that's why [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2753.08s)]
*  they've been engaged. For the record, even if those ambulances [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2757.88s)]
*  did not have their lights on, what do you mean it's valid to shoot at ambulances? [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2762.44s)]
*  Even Israel's initial defense is psychotic and only works because there is so much dehumanizing [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2768.12s)]

*  the standard of international law. Think about that. Like their first line of defense they came [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2784.2s)]
*  out with also didn't make sense. So mad, Lamau, but we'll never talk about Muslims, murders, [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2789.56s)]
*  and killers, hypocrites, huh? What are you talking about? What the fuck are you saying? What do you [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2793.48s)]
*  mean this is hypocritical? So mad, Lamau. Yeah, I am mad. If you have a fucking conscience, you [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2798.36s)]
*  should be mad too, dumb fuck. What do you mean? So mad, Lamau. Like you think this isn't something [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2803.48s)]
*  to be mad about? You're fine with this? It seems like you are considering that you immediately want [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2812.52s)]
*  to go, what about Muslims murderers? I'm not even saying this is Jews doing the murder. You understand [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2818.04s)]
*  that, right? Because that's not the case. This is Israel doing it. You fucking baboon. That's the [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2823.08s)]
*  other thing. This is another reason why Islamophobia is perfectly permissible, [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2827.96s)]
*  except antisemitism, at least not right now. And that's changing. But for the time being, [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2833.0s)]
*  antisemitism is still institutionally regarded as something that's inappropriate and unacceptable. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2839.16s)]
*  Now that's changing. Make no mistake, especially if you're a right-winger, holy moly. They say, [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2846.52s)]
*  they do say this exact same thing, but role reversal with Jews. They literally would just [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2851.32s)]
*  turn around and be like, yeah. The irony, of course, is that this person cannot even comprehend [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2855.8s)]
*  the words that are coming out of my mouth because I was just talking about ISIS. Talking about ISIS [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2859.7200000000003s)]
*  and the false conflation of Islam and ISIS. He just doesn't understand that. In his mind, [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2865.6400000000003s)]
*  he's like, this is how all Muslims are. By these Israeli forces in this suburb, this area, [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2872.52s)]
*  just outside of Ra'afah in the southern part of the Gaza Strip. Now they say that they're looking [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2877.7200000000003s)]
*  into it. They say that at least six of those who were killed had links with Hamas. They have [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2884.52s)]
*  produced no evidence to prove that or to demonstrate that at this stage. And they have said that none [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2890.44s)]
*  of these people that were killed were armed. They were then buried in these shallow graves covered [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2897.4s)]
*  over by sand. The Israeli authorities say they did that to prevent wild animals from taking the [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2902.36s)]
*  bodies of these people. But it did then take a week for the UN to be able to find this sort of [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2908.44s)]
*  shallow grave. I suppose you'd call it. And some of the people that examined those bodies have [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2914.2000000000003s)]
*  suggested that, that these were sort of execution style killings, perhaps some people with their [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2918.68s)]
*  hands tied now to the pro. Yeah. I mean, it was execution style killings by the way, here's a [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2924.68s)]

*  who should be able to go anywhere in the world. If you're not a very educated guy and you have [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2943.96s)]
*  no capacity for critical thinking and you see a British MP go on television and be like, yeah, [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2950.6000000000004s)]
*  Israel's the Jewish nation state and they get to do this to our MPs. I care more about Israel [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2958.92s)]
*  and their actions than I do my own countrymen. How the fuck is the expectation that that person [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2968.28s)]
*  watching this news hit is not going to come out of that thinking, oh my God, Jews do fucking control [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2974.6800000000003s)]

*  The last year and the way that politicians in the West have tried to dance around this issue [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2993.0s)]
*  and avoid the overwhelming public sentiment against Israel is like out of the dreams of [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=2999.96s)]
*  David Duke. Okay. They don't even have to do propaganda anymore. They don't have to fucking [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=3008.52s)]

*  are saying over and over again. Be like, see, they're saying Israel's for the Jews is the [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=3020.36s)]
*  Jewish nation and we must defend them. And if you criticize them, then you're anti-Semitic. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=3024.6800000000003s)]

*  you have given your views. I guess there's a hidden truth there, by the way, which is that [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=3100.6800000000003s)]

*  what it means. I mean, obviously it doesn't, it doesn't actually mean putting American citizens [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=3124.76s)]
*  first. America first does not mean you're putting actual citizens first. That's never been the case. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=3130.0400000000004s)]

*  Okay. He's their guy in Israel and he has, he's done a lot of, you know, pro-Israel propaganda, [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=3190.84s)]
*  make no mistake, but in the sea of that pro-Israel propaganda, he is one of the only, [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=3197.64s)]
*  one of the only journalists in any mainstream publication that has demonstrated a clear [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=3204.6s)]

*  it's the Fox news guy. Okay. He is the Fox news guy and he has consistently been like Israel's [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=3218.68s)]
*  killing journalists. What the fuck are you guys doing? How are you guys not talking about how [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=3225.64s)]
*  Israel just keeps killing journalists? How is this acceptable? And now he's also covering the [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=3229.7999999999997s)]

*  several vehicles were identified advancing suspiciously toward IDF troops without headlights [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=3277.08s)]

*  contradicts that statement. The IDF also claimed in the initial findings that nine out of the 15 [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=3288.6800000000003s)]

*  story in the way that you normally would. It has nothing to do with anti-Semitism. What the fuck? [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=3390.68s)]
*  They had killed them and buried them underground as bodies of these medics rest inside white plastic [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVjx9K-W7k&t=3396.44s)]
