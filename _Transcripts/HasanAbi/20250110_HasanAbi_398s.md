# The Controversy Over Free Speech On Facebook | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI)
*  I remember this at the time because I covered it at the time. I was like, Mark Zuckerberg [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=0.0s)]
*  wants cause deniers to stay on the platform. Well, you guys failed to comprehend or consider [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=5.84s)]
*  is that no billionaire is [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=11.6s)]
*  I've obtained internal metadox with example posts of now allowed under new hate speech rules. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=19.28s)]
*  Examples include calling children. I'm not going to say the word or even saying things like Jews [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=23.6s)]
*  are flat out greedier than Christians and immigrants are grubby filthy pieces of shit. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=28.4s)]
*  The loosened rules allow for overstatements of superiority and unsurprisingly given the national [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=33.28s)]
*  moment carve out a particular latitude for hateful comments about transgender people and [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=37.92s)]
*  immigrants. The documents outlines the document outlines that the times arbitrary boundaries [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  meta has drawn with respect to hate speech. Lesbians are so stupid is cited against the rules [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=46.4s)]
*  while trans people are mentally ill or gay people are sinners are now marked as allowable. Wait, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=50.8s)]
*  is there a big lesbian lobby? What's going on? That's so funny that Mark is, I think a lot of [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=55.44s)]
*  old heads don't remember this, but I covered this before Mark Zuckerberg quite literally [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=61.28s)]
*  allowed anti-Semitism on meta for the longest time. He does not care about anti-Semitism. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  What did he, what did he originally say? I remember listening to him in an interview being like, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=70.96s)]
*  I think you should be able to question how many people died in the, yeah, here it is. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=76.4s)]
*  This is from 2020. Okay. Facebook's decision to disallow cost denial after previously affirming [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=80.32s)]
*  it reflects the company's shifting stances on free speech. Three years ago, Facebook chief in 2017, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=86.63999999999999s)]
*  I remember covering it. A chief executive Mark Zuckerberg stridently defended the rights of [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  cause deniers to publish their thoughts on the social media giants platform saying it wasn't in [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=96.32s)]
*  the business of removing content just because it was factually wrong. The comment a year after the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=100.24s)]
*  neo Nazi rally in Charlottesville was considered one of Zuckerberg's boldest stances affirming his [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=104.24s)]
*  permissive views on free speech. A watershed moment that preceded his controversial announcement [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=108.72s)]
*  a year later that the company would not fact check statements from politicians. It drew a huge [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=113.12s)]
*  backlash from Jewish groups and cost survivors. A lot of you don't remember this. I do. Mark [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=117.76s)]
*  Zuckerberg was literally, he openly defended like openly actively defended. Yeah. Why Mark Zuckerberg [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=123.12s)]
*  says Facebook won't ban info wars and cause deniers in an interview published by recode. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=132.4s)]
*  Let me just come on. Just show me the video man. Cause I'm pretty sure he said it on tape. Oh wow. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=137.12s)]
*  Now you can't even find the goddamn interview that he made. Anyway, Facebook has the responsibility [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=141.68s)]
*  curve. The viral spread of hoaxes and blatant misinformation, but he maintained Facebook should [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=146.88s)]
*  not ban publishers for spreading false claims. A position you described as too extreme. The [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=150.48000000000002s)]
*  approach we've taken to false news is to not say you can't say something wrong on the internet. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=154.56s)]
*  Everyone gets things wrong. And if we're talking down people's accounts, when they got a few things [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=158.0s)]
*  wrong, then that would be a hard world for giving people a voice and saying that you care about that. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=162.56s)]
*  Zuckerberg said if people flag post potential hoaxes, Facebook will send the content fact [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=167.20000000000002s)]
*  checkers to verify those claims. Zuckerberg who is Jewish also said people who deny the [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=171.12s)]
*  hot costs happen should be allowed to stay on the social network too. I find that deeply offensive, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=176.08s)]
*  but at the end of the day, I don't believe that our platform should take that down because I think [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=181.44s)]
*  there are things that different people get wrong. Zuckerberg added, it's difficult to understand a [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=184.8s)]
*  person's intent. He said Facebook shouldn't ban people from the network. Even if they spread [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=188.72s)]
*  false information on multiple occasions, Zuckerberg later clarified the recode on Wednesday afternoon. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  I personally find cost denial deeply offensive and I absolutely didn't intend to defend the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=196.48s)]
*  intent of people who deny that. I'm Jewish. And there's a set of people who deny that the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=200.39999999999998s)]
*  cost happens. Right. I find that deeply offensive. But at the end of the day, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=206.64s)]
*  I don't believe that our platform should take that down because I think that there are things [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=213.28s)]
*  that different people get wrong. Either I don't think that they're intentionally getting wrong, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=218.79999999999998s)]
*  but I think that they, in case of the hot characters, like in case of the hot [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=224.16s)]
*  cause they might be, but go home. It's, it's hard to impugn intent. I just don't think that [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=227.12s)]
*  it is the right thing to say we are going to take someone off the platform. If they get things wrong, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=233.28s)]
*  even multiple time. Yeah, I remember this at the time. I remember this at the time, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=240.48s)]
*  cause I covered it at the time. I was like, Mark Zuckerberg wants cause deniers to stay on the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=245.44s)]
*  platform. What you guys fail to comprehend or consider is that no billionaire is in any way, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=252.4s)]
*  shape or form interested in maintaining some sort of like real ideological position against [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  political dissidents, no matter how ridiculous they are, no matter how violent and dangerous [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=268.32s)]
*  their ideology is. Mark Zuckerberg only cares about money. That's it. And after the last couple [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=273.04s)]
*  of years of, of, I guess, wokeness, they're finally able to just be open. Okay. He would [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=279.2s)]
*  much rather not have, he doesn't even care about Nazis being on the platform, but he probably does [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=285.36s)]
*  care. I mean, he very actively does care about Palestinians speaking about pro-Palestinian, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=290.8s)]
*  pro-Palestinian sentiment on the platform. He has banned them and it's not because he's Jewish. What? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=297.44s)]
*  No, him being Jewish has nothing to do with anything. He is a capitalist first and foremost. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=303.03999999999996s)]
*  He is a billionaire. First and foremost, there is no better representation of this than a prominent [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=309.44s)]
*  Jewish man going on television and being like, yeah, Holocaust deniers are a okay on my platform. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=315.44s)]
*  That's it. Yeah. No, he, the chatter agrees with me. It is just saying like, he's just saying before [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=323.12s)]
*  people, you know, before people jump to conclusions. You've said before the anti-Semitic people are [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=329.36s)]
*  just mad at capitalism. No, the famous, the famous adages of anti-Semitism is the anti-socialism of [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=334.08000000000004s)]
*  fools, I think, right? Or something like that. People who are, people who are mad at the systems [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=341.84000000000003s)]
*  that, that are oppressing them have no other viable outlet to channel their anger through. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=347.04s)]
*  So they just turn around and get mad randomly and inappropriately at a group of individuals that are [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=354.16s)]
*  upset. Anti-Semitism is the socialism of fools. Sorry. Yeah. Anti-Semitism is the anti-capitalism [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=362.0s)]
*  of fools. Elam, after this game, we have a spot. Elam. He's so bad at faking that he knows [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=370.16s)]
*  misinformation and incendiary speech should be regulated on social media platforms, but doesn't [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=377.04s)]
*  want to because it's bad for business. Yeah. Also, it doesn't really matter. He just like, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=381.2s)]
*  he wants to, he wants to generate more profits and cozying up to Donald Trump will help you. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH1c24Dh0vI&t=386.64s)]
