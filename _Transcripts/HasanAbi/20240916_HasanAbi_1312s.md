*  People watch that train wreck of a conversation between JD Vance and Dana Fash and said JD Vance [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=23.84s)]
*  wrecks Dana Fash in insane propagandism [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=29.6s)]
*  Now entered week two of Catgate [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=32.96s)]
*  This is the argument of whether Haitian immigrants are eating cats in Springfield [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=35.6s)]
*  Dude no no no no no no you don't get to say oh it's so silly Catgate [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=39.92s)]

*  Your people made this up [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=47.92s)]
*  Okay you can't just like oh god it's Catgate how silly [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=50.96s)]
*  Like what do you mean? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=55.92s)]
*  Oh god it's such a silly story it's like yeah okay if it's a silly story what the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=59.12s)]
*  Are your people lying about it so regularly? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  Ohio now as I mentioned last week there are very serious issues regarding Springfield [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=68.08s)]
*  Ohio issues about the impact of mass migration [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=72.64s)]
*  About giving temporary protected status to tens of thousands of people [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=75.68s)]
*  Without vetting them there's a real issues [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=78.88s)]
*  Create that's not true in order to get TPS you do get vetting so that's also literally [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=80.96s)]
*  He just lied right out the gate [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=85.67999999999999s)]
*  Massive social services burdens it creates problems of cultural integration [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=87.36s)]
*  It creates problems of crime it creates all sorts of issues [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  Remember what I told you about Ben Shapiro being like the smarter conservative? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=94.8s)]
*  I mean obviously there's like there's a limit to how smart you can be as a conservative [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=99.52s)]
*  Propagandist but like but there it is you know he's like oh there's problems of cultural [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=103.52s)]
*  Integration it's like yeah no there isn't okay what's the problem with cultural integration? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=108.56s)]
*  Why would there be a problem with cultural integration what are the cultural differences [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=114.4s)]
*  When you take a town of 60,000 people and just add on 20,000 migrants from Haiti [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=118.72s)]
*  Because you want to staff up the local factories as though you couldn't [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=124.08s)]
*  For reference to fact check Ben yes people interested in TPS must file an application [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=127.2s)]
*  With the US citizenship and immigration services all individuals applying for TPS undergo security [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=130.8s)]
*  And background checks as part of determining eligibility of course it has background [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=135.52s)]
*  checks find anybody anywhere else in America to do any of that [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=138.48s)]
*  Now that's kind of a problem however it seems to me a distraction to be talking about [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=142.0s)]
*  Whether they're eating the dogs and eating the cats and remember that started off as kind of a [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=147.6s)]
*  Originally mentioned by JD Vance because some of his constituents had mentioned to him [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=151.2s)]
*  Reports like that and then Donald Trump took that and ran with it during the debate [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=156.56s)]
*  And expanded it to not only eating the cats but also the dogs and also apparently other household [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  Pets and that of course became the living meme from the actual debate there's a remix of the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=165.6s)]
*  Trump eating the dogs eating the cat song that absolutely slaps my kids love it i'm not even [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=170.48s)]
*  Kidding that's a real thing however it would be about time right are they talking about megaphonics [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=174.24s)]
*  Did Ben Shapiro's children watch megaphonics did Ben Shapiro's kids watch the megaphonics remix [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=179.28s)]
*  I really hope there's a noticeable bump in the polls for Donald Trump I really really hope there's [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=185.6s)]
*  A noticeable bump in the polls and it's single-handedly caused by megaphonics [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=191.84s)]
*  That's awesome my 65 year old dad showed me megaphonics's remix and I was dying oh my god [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=197.52s)]
*  He's probably talking about this hello and welcome to the first the second the first nihilism is now [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=205.12s)]
*  Cringe and boring I don't care tonight enough but prices got out of control I don't know if this is [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=211.44s)]
*  The one could be this in Springfield they're they're eating the pets they're eating the cats [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=216.8s)]
*  They're eating the pets there's a tiktok one too probably eating the dogs they're eating the cats [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=223.84s)]
*  Oh yeah this song um the this song popped off on tiktok [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=229.20000000000002s)]
*  They're eating the dogs they're eating the cats eat the cat eat the cat I had at least four [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=236.16000000000003s)]
*  MAGA gym rats blasting it at the gym what they went in the hot they then we hit the hot tub and [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=241.60000000000002s)]
*  During the lotion sessions they were replaying it again and again it was diabolical for the record [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=246.56s)]
*  I've been dmca'ing everyone who tries to re-upload it and they all get copy strikes on their channel [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=250.64000000000001s)]
*  Law I don't know man take a day off chatter anyways now for the trump campaign to focus in on you know [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=255.12s)]
*  The fact that Kamala Harris is an awful candidate who believes terrible things and won't make clear [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=262.08s)]
*  Any of her positions it seems like it should be about that the media have one job and one job only [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=265.28s)]
*  And that is to turn this campaign into a on cat gate that is that is what this is all about [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=270.32s)]
*  It's it's foolish it makes no sense the media have decided that this is a major issue that [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=276.96s)]
*  They're going to push over and over and over they're doing it largely as a distraction so for example [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=281.92s)]
*  JD Vance yesterday was with Dana bash and Dana bash for like 17 minutes asked him about the eating [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=286.4s)]
*  The cats and the dogs thing and Vance just rector I mean he really did really so you're upset about [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=291.68s)]
*  Donald Trump having a policy free candidacy you're upset about him not like calling to [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=299.2s)]
*  Attention how bad Kamala Harris is but then you're also you're also personally saying that he did a [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=305.52s)]
*  Phenomenal job bro 4g auto rose what oh my god well true love always finds a way thank god thank [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=311.44s)]
*  God she found true love again Sean called this wait no you did she only dates the best rappers [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=323.6s)]
*  True I've been said they was smashing do you think that was the finger that went up Kanye I don't know [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=331.68s)]
*  Probably not that finger it'd be hard to put that in there I always assumed that she was using her [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=338.72s)]
*  Thumb inside of Kanye's booty hole anyway let's get back to JD Vance there's one point during this [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=343.36s)]
*  Interview where he calls her out for just sycophantically presenting answers to Kamala [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=348.88s)]
*  Harris during the only other interview that she's done during this entire campaign cycle here he was [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=353.44s)]
*  Would you like to ask me questions and then let me answer them or would you like to debate me [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=358.08s)]
*  On on these topics I noticed that when you had Kamala Harris and Tim Waltz you gave them multiple [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=363.28s)]
*  Choice answers to the questions that you asked and you allowed them to answer the questions [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=368.48s)]
*  I'm happy to hear to be here to talk about policy but if you're going to interrupt me every single [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=372.71999999999997s)]
*  Time that I open my mouth then why am I even doing this okay so that happened to be a really [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=377.76s)]
*  Really good point but she wasn't there to ask him questions and get answers she was there to [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=382.8s)]
*  Browbeat him so the same day that somebody allegedly attempted to shoot Donald Trump again [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=386.96s)]
*  Dana Bash spent 17 minutes implying that JD Vance was responsible for bomb threats in Springfield [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=391.03999999999996s)]
*  Ohio because of a cat gate nobody is disputing that the that the town of Springfield Ohio [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=395.68s)]
*  Needs help but you're not just a bystander you're the senator from Ohio so instead of [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=402.64s)]
*  Saying things that are are wrong and actually causing the hospitals the schools the government [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=410.08s)]
*  Buildings to be evacuated because of bomb threats because of the cats and dogs thing why not actually [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=414.56s)]
*  Be constructive and helping to better integrate them into the community [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=422.8s)]
*  Dana first of all let me just respond to a couple things that you said but I want to start with [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=426.72s)]
*  Something you said which I think is frankly disgusting and is more appropriate for a democratic [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=430.72s)]
*  Propagandist than it is for an American journalist there is nothing that I have said that has led to [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=435.12s)]
*  Threats against these hospitals these hospitals is he going to show the most important part that like [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=441.20000000000005s)]
*  The media is talking about I wonder because like I'm gonna be honest with you nobody gives a [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=447.28000000000003s)]
*  About the Sunday programming okay this isn't like 19 this isn't like 1987 they care about the [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=452.88000000000005s)]
*  Highlights and the highlight of this conversation is JD Vance openly admitting that he made it the [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=459.44s)]
*  Up hospitals the bomb threats and so forth it's disgusting you just accused me of inciting violence [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=464.88s)]
*  Against the community when all that I've done is surface the constituents people who are suffering [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=471.68s)]
*  Because of Kamala Harris's policies are we not allowed to talk about these problems [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=477.92s)]
*  Because some psychopaths are threatening violence in the middle of this interview with Dana Bash [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=482.96s)]
*  The media attempt to swivel away from Dana Bash having an awful interview with Kamala Harris and [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=487.59999999999997s)]
*  JD Vance calling her on it to focus on this clip while the media are fact-checking Donald Trump on [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=492.08s)]
*  Eating dogs and cats the Harris administration continues to claim that illegal immigration is [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=496.79999999999995s)]
*  Not a big problem at all because they're lying just like they're lying about not coming after you [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=501.44s)]
*  For taxes are you still struggling with back taxes or unfiled returns handle this alone say [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=505.59999999999997s)]
*  So in this clip JD Vance says that his weak his constituents have been complaining about the eating [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=510.4s)]
*  The cats thing right and that he has surfaced that and he has elevated that complaint as sort [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=515.92s)]
*  Of the tip of the spear in order to put focus on the problems in Springfield, Ohio [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=521.5999999999999s)]
*  The way oh he is talking about it, but he's massaging it [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=525.4399999999999s)]
*  Wow, just let it sit Ben just show it Ben show it [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=529.28s)]
*  Come on an ad in a nine minute vid is diabolical bro. He puts like two sometimes. He's crazy. He's got to be pissed dude [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=533.68s)]
*  There's just wait what's popular [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=540.64s)]
*  On a lot of corners of the left to say that we have a we have a both sides problem [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=543.04s)]
*  And i'm not going to say we're always perfect. I'm not going to say that conservatives always get things exactly right [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=548.0s)]
*  But you know the big difference between conservatives and liberals is that we have no one has tried to [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=553.84s)]
*  Kamala harris in the last couple of months and you almost said we haven't tried to kamala harris [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=559.8199999999999s)]

*  Somebody's gonna get hurt by it and it's gonna destroy this country [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=577.04s)]

*  The way that the media decided to interpret this is that jd vance made up out of whole cloth the claims [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=695.92s)]
*  About people eating cats in springfield, ohio that he made up a story in order to get attention [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=700.4s)]

*  Donald trump and I started talking about cat memes if I have to [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=730.5600000000001s)]
*  Create stories so that the american media actually pays attention to the suffering of the american people [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=735.52s)]

*  I didn't create 20 000 illegal migrants coming into springfield. Thanks to kamala harris's policies [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=764.48s)]
*  Okay, so he's not saying that he made up the cat story [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=770.96s)]
*  He's saying his constituents are telling him this thing [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=773.6s)]
*  He's elevating their complaints and then he's quote unquote creating a story in the same way that the media create a story meaning [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=775.68s)]
*  Creates a narrative around a true story or a story that has been reported by his constituents [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=781.36s)]
*  The media decided they're going to run with this idea that he made up the cat story out of whole cloth because what they want [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=786.16s)]
*  More than anything is to distract from the actual issues of the campaign [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=791.12s)]
*  Here is josh shapiro the person who was not picked for vice president of the united states by kamala harris because he happens to be a jew [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=793.6s)]

*  For his own lies [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=832.48s)]
*  This guy's so pathetic. But the thing is it is dangerous [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=834.32s)]
*  There is a causal connection [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=839.04s)]
*  Between the bs that jd vance and donald trump spew [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=841.1999999999999s)]
*  And the safety and security of the american people [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=846.24s)]

*  When donald trump said some of those guys are very fine people [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=938.98s)]
*  I I felt it and I think it's crazy. That's a hoax that the media is [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=943.9399999999999s)]

*  Hardcore ground game that democrats are so good at [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=964.02s)]
*  That's going to be the election but the bottom line is this [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=967.38s)]
*  You know today I think we should all be once again thanking god that donald trump was not shot today [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=970.34s)]
*  Once again, we should be recognizing that we are one bullet away from a vast cliff that no one knows [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=974.5799999999999s)]
*  What I don't understand why they say it was a hoax can you explain it? Yeah [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=981.78s)]
*  After charlottesville when it's protesting in the streets and then one of those terrorists actually a counter-protester and anti-fascist [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=986.9s)]
*  Donald trump came out very fine people on both sides. Okay [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=993.6999999999999s)]
*  This was a very famous moment in his administration because people were like genuinely shocked that a sitting president [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=998.02s)]
*  openly caped for right like straight up not even like [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1004.74s)]
*  Regular rolled like suburban hitlerites i'm talking like dudes who got swastika tattoos [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1008.26s)]
*  dudes who were like waving the swastikas [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1014.0999999999999s)]
*  and um [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1017.06s)]
*  You know just regular old run of the mill like out and about right like the kinds that are in ohio marching [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1018.5s)]
*  Okay, and it was truly unique to have a president in recent times openly look to that and be like [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1024.98s)]
*  Yeah, there's some very fine people on that side as well [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1032.02s)]
*  I thought that was about a confederate flag statue protest. Yes [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1035.3s)]
*  That was where that happened [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1038.8999999999999s)]
*  Yes, the unite the right was a rally put together by and their goal was to protect a confederate statue [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1041.3s)]
*  In that protest they were chanting [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1048.6599999999999s)]
*  Jews will not replace us. Okay, the it's one of those stories where the context makes it more damning [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1050.98s)]
*  You know what? I mean like republicans can only I guess get away with [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1057.78s)]
*  Get away with it because it happened a little ago and people don't remember the exact details [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1061.6200000000001s)]
*  So they'll act like there's context that actually makes it better for them overall [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1065.3s)]
*  But when you actually look at the context you're like, oh my god, this makes it so much worse [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1069.6200000000001s)]
*  So you mean to tell me that it wasn't just like protesting against like, I don't know gun control or something [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1073.94s)]
*  They were just straight up also protesting at the behest of the confederacy and defending it [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1079.22s)]
*  Okay, that made the analysis worse for you [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1083.94s)]
*  That's why when they can only get away with being like oh charlesville's a hoax and just like hand wave it away [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1086.98s)]
*  So you should ask them. What do you mean by that? [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1092.02s)]
*  What do you mean by how it was a hoax like they weren't out there fucking protest against breast cancer [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1094.5800000000002s)]
*  They were out there to protest against a confederate statue being taken down [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1099.94s)]
*  Okay, like so, you know, you can't even do this like [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1104.9s)]
*  liberal style debunking [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1109.3000000000002s)]
*  That liberals love doing like the fact check, please erm, what the sigma? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1111.5400000000002s)]
*  Can we get a fact check, please like you can't even do that republicans can never do that [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1115.8600000000001s)]
*  Because when you look at the actual facts, you're like, oh my god [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1120.74s)]
*  It actually seems even worse than before [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1124.02s)]
*  I forgot some of the details of the story and now that I know some of the details of the story [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1126.66s)]
*  I have realized that it's worse than I thought it was what's going to happen if we fall off of it [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1132.18s)]
*  I mean I felt this way in july 13th. Thank god. Donald trump avoided that blue [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1137.3s)]
*  It was an act of god that he avoided that bullet july 13th [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1141.14s)]
*  Yesterday he avoided another assassin [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1144.18s)]
*  There's a country that feels like it's on the precipice of something quite terrible [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1147.06s)]
*  And there are only a couple of things that can be done to prevent it. One is obviously better secret service [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1150.6599999999999s)]
*  I'm confused how jews will not replace this makes sense that a confederate statue protest. It's not that confusing [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1155.06s)]
*  the confederate [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1160.74s)]
*  Okay [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1162.26s)]
*  It was a it was a statue of the confederate general robert e lee [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1163.1399999999999s)]
*  Robert e lee was a loser [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1167.3799999999999s)]
*  But even robert e lee on his deathbed said that there should be no monuments erected in his honor [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1168.98s)]
*  Robert e lee's great also are very much anti robert e lee statues being erected [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1174.58s)]
*  Many of the confederate statues and confederate monuments and confederate schools that were named after generals [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1179.38s)]
*  Weren't actually named in the immediate aftermath of the civil war [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1185.3s)]
*  Many of them were actually erected in the civil rights movement. Now. Do you want to understand why? [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1188.98s)]
*  Someone in a southern town would actually erect a confederate statue [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1195.1399999999999s)]
*  during the [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1200.26s)]
*  civil rights movement [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1201.3799999999999s)]
*  Why would they do that? It's you know, why they would do that. It's to tell you what the racial pecking order is [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1203.3799999999999s)]
*  Okay, that's precisely the reason why a lot of these statues that were erected these monuments were put outside of courthouses [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1209.86s)]
*  For example as a somber reminder [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1216.1s)]
*  To know whose country you're in. Okay [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1219.3s)]
*  So if you think [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1223.06s)]
*  that [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1225.54s)]
*  Personally, it's weird that it would be in defense of the confederate [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1226.5s)]
*  In defense of the legacy of the confederacy. I don't know what to tell you the confederacy fought to preserve slavery [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1230.18s)]
*  Okay, they fought to preserve slavery for white people to be able to own black people as humans [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1237.3799999999999s)]
*  They're not as human. Sorry, but as chattel. Okay, why didn't I know about this? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1245.14s)]
*  Well, because you don't watch my broadcast [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1249.54s)]
*  I guess you do 23 months. You should know about this [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1252.66s)]
*  I've definitely talked about it a lot both in the past and continue to do so but the other is [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1255.46s)]
*  People need to stop proclaiming that people on the other side of the political aisle [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1261.22s)]
*  Are going to full scale destroy the country in our hitlerian figures [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1265.46s)]
*  They should not do that because the more you say that the more you are making it real [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1269.3799999999999s)]
*  And that is something that unfortunately the media seem to have no intention. Yeah. No, don't tell don't tell trump to like dial back [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1274.02s)]
*  He says don't tell trump or jd vance to dial back there. Okay. Yeah [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1281.14s)]
*  That's a story where he literally defended jd vance being like yeah, I made that up about like [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1285.6200000000001s)]
*  Immigrants eating cats and stuff. That's not violent rhetoric saying [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1291.14s)]
*  Trump is doing hitler speeches when he objectively is doing hitler speeches [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1295.7800000000002s)]
*  That's really violent rhetoric police open anyway [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1301.14s)]
*  Speaking of violence and how commonplace it is in our day-to-day existence. Let's get to new york [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQYJgZqlbLo&t=1304.5800000000002s)]
