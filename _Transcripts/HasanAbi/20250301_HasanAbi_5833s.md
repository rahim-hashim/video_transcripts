*  wear a LeBron jersey. They're going to, you have to be good. I have to dunk on someone. You have to [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZo5h5FPbH0&t=790.76s)]
*  finish a game, every game, bare minimum with four, four and four. Yeah. That's like street ball. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZo5h5FPbH0&t=795.72s)]
*  Yeah. That would be, yeah, that would be his, that would be his 10 point streak. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZo5h5FPbH0&t=801.08s)]
*  I have to have a career 10 point streak that I have to keep alive. Yeah. Yeah. For sure. That's [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZo5h5FPbH0&t=806.6s)]

*  it's not. All those switches, like eventually he's going to be on a six, three guard. Dude, it's, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZo5h5FPbH0&t=818.76s)]
*  yeah, it's so funny. It's so funny watching him play. Like I get how he's at his age still able [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZo5h5FPbH0&t=823.88s)]
*  to do the things that he's doing because he has zero bag. You think he has zero bag? I think, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZo5h5FPbH0&t=832.1999999999999s)]
*  well, okay. I think that's the biggest bag of all time. No, I think like what I mean by bag is like [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZo5h5FPbH0&t=839.16s)]
*  flashy explosive maneuvering. Yeah. Like he's just so solid fundamental basketball all the way. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZo5h5FPbH0&t=843.9599999999999s)]
*  Like he, everything he does is not, none of it is a waste. I feel like he plays basketball in the [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZo5h5FPbH0&t=851.72s)]
*  exact opposite way of, of, uh, Lamello. Like where he's all bag. Yeah. Yeah. He's all bag. He's all [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZo5h5FPbH0&t=856.76s)]

*  two sixty that can make a full speed layup. Like there's guys that are like five one that can't [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZo5h5FPbH0&t=877.32s)]
*  make a full like running your fastest and still able to lay up the ball. I think Zion can do it. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZo5h5FPbH0&t=881.88s)]
*  I don't know if another person. Well, but see, but the problem with Zion is like he's stretching the [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZo5h5FPbH0&t=887.24s)]
*  limits of physicality. So he just keeps exploding himself. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. A hundred percent. His [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZo5h5FPbH0&t=891.88s)]
*  headstrings are very tired. Yeah. Whereas like LeBron James on the other hand has been able to [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZo5h5FPbH0&t=897.88s)]
*  like consistently stay solid. He also, I will say I don't want to weight shame Zion, but I just feel [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZo5h5FPbH0&t=902.44s)]
*  like you should have, like his weight just go, there's just like, oh, Zion's as low as he's ever [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZo5h5FPbH0&t=912.36s)]
*  been 263. Like why is this news? What's he before? No, I don't, I don't understand that. I genuinely [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZo5h5FPbH0&t=919.08s)]
*  don't understand that. I like if you're making like if you're slated to make hundreds of millions [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZo5h5FPbH0&t=926.12s)]
*  of dollars a year at that level, like just stop eating nuggets, man. Just what are you doing? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZo5h5FPbH0&t=933.88s)]

*  most interesting person in the NBA. Like his, he, he has that, he just gets away with it because when [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZo5h5FPbH0&t=960.9200000000001s)]
*  they interview him, you don't see any flashes of what he does like off court. Wait, wait, what does [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZo5h5FPbH0&t=967.32s)]
*  he do off court? First it was like that Duke incident, like when he had a Snapchat to all those girls. Oh yeah. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZo5h5FPbH0&t=971.72s)]
*  But when you interview him, it's just like, Hey, what's up? So it's like, ah, that's not the same guy. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZo5h5FPbH0&t=977.0s)]
*  Then it's just like, Oh, this guy's overeating. He's not in shape. And then they interview him. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZo5h5FPbH0&t=981.0s)]
*  And then he just like, don't worry about it. I got it. And it's like, Oh, he got it. You know, he just [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZo5h5FPbH0&t=985.56s)]
*  like, he doesn't, he doesn't strike you as a fuck up. No, no, no. And then that, and then his, I don't [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZo5h5FPbH0&t=989.16s)]
*  know if that was his girlfriend or what the Mariah Miller situation. Yeah. It was, it wasn't like, I [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZo5h5FPbH0&t=993.72s)]

*  I was like, I think it's medical malpractice at that point. Like, or BBL. Bro, after the second one, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZo5h5FPbH0&t=1024.28s)]
*  the doctor should be like, this is not appropriate for me to do medically. Was she making it bigger [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZo5h5FPbH0&t=1030.04s)]
*  every time or fixing something? I don't know. I mean, it looked like she was making it bigger. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZo5h5FPbH0&t=1035.6399999999999s)]
*  It had its own gravitational pull. Oh my God. Four BBLs. It's just, she had a punch card. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZo5h5FPbH0&t=1041.0s)]
*  Yeah. She's LeBron. Four for the price of three. LeBron of BBLs. Yeah. Four ships. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZo5h5FPbH0&t=1050.6s)]

*  and putting new stuff in? Like, is it like a full chain? Yeah. I think like maybe, maybe it's like, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZo5h5FPbH0&t=1063.24s)]
*  you have an A cup on, on the, on, you know, boobs. You have an A cup and then you go up to like a B [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZo5h5FPbH0&t=1067.96s)]

*  That's what I would do. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZo5h5FPbH0&t=2034.14s)]
*  That's what I would do? [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZo5h5FPbH0&t=2036.14s)]
*  You usually do that. You really don't. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZo5h5FPbH0&t=2038.14s)]
*  I went last night and played the one I'm over there. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZo5h5FPbH0&t=2040.14s)]
