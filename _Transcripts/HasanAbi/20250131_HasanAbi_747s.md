# Unveiling The Truth About Japanese Politics | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk)
*  And remember, this is post-World War II in Japan. So it's not, we're not talking about like a, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=0.0s)]
*  a normal circumstance. We're talking about post-World War II period in Japan, where there's [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=8.72s)]
*  still plenty of remnants of the previous governance of the Japanese empire at that point. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  And the allies have designed the country, well, not the allies, specifically the American [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  government has designed the country in its own vision. And it is functionally an occupied [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=27.2s)]
*  nation, which is part of the reason to these guys. This is, they're not, not exactly super, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=32.96s)]
*  you know, they're, they're somewhat understandably secretive in their, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=46.0s)]
*  in the way that they operate. But I have an incredible opportunity to is and go to their [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=53.04s)]
*  headquarters and get a better understanding of like what they're about really. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=61.36s)]
*  Okay. Their abbreviation is JCP. They were founded in the fifth on the 15th of July, 1922, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  102 years ago. We are going to be heading to their headquarters in Shibuya. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=75.6s)]
*  They have a youth wing called the democratic youth league of Japan and their membership as [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=80.8s)]
*  of January, 2024 is around 250,000. I've heard numbers as high as 500,000 though. So I'm actually [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=85.12s)]
*  kind of confused why it says it's a 250,000 and the membership numbers are obviously declining. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=92.08s)]
*  Their political position according to Wikipedia is left wing to far left. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=100.4s)]
*  Monique seven, seven, seven. Thank you. But they've gone through multiple different formations [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=104.0s)]
*  throughout time. They've had a more revolutionary wing and they've had a more revisionist wing. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=112.72s)]
*  And obviously the current party formation in and of itself is, is revisionist. Why the are you going [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  to a Japanese communist party meeting? How would you, how would that make any sense with what [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=125.84s)]
*  I'm a political commentator who has left this and I like, it make me worried for you dog, old mad Frank. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=131.44s)]
*  What I'm a leftist political content creator and I'm fascinated with the world of Japanese politics [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=142.95999999999998s)]
*  and would love the opportunity to interview people that are directly a part of this movie. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=154.23999999999998s)]
*  And if you are a movement, what do you mean you are worried about me dog? And yes, I will have [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=161.04s)]
*  someone with me who was actually a researcher researching and writing a dissertation on the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=167.2s)]
*  Japanese communist party. As a matter of fact, he's the, he's how we were able to get this level of [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=174.16s)]
*  access. Is this like some weird anarchist grievance? I don't know what that man was talking about. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=180.32s)]
*  I have seen Kava bars. Yes. I've pet Kava bars as well. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=189.84s)]
*  Yeah. DJ academics moment. JCB found in 1920, 20, 1922 in consultation with the common turn [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=205.2s)]
*  was deemed illegal in 1925 and repressed for the next 30 years, engaging in underground activity. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  After world war two, the party was legalized in 1945 by the allied occupation authorities, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=215.6s)]
*  but it's unexpected success in 1949 general election led to the red purge in which tens of [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=219.76s)]
*  thousands of actual and suspected communists were fired from their jobs in government education and [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=225.2s)]
*  industry. The Soviet union encouraged the JCP to respond with a violent revolution and the resulting [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=228.56s)]
*  internal debate fractured the party into several factions. The dominant faction backed by the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  Soviets waged an unsuccessful guerrilla campaign in the rural areas. We've covered this before, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=238.16s)]
*  which undercut the party's public support. So as is historically the case with many [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=242.48s)]
*  communist socialist formations all around the world, not only is there a tremendous [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=249.04s)]
*  political repression, oftentimes backed by just adjacent or directly focused governments [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=255.35999999999999s)]
*  and also a decent amount of sectarian infighting due to methods that, that, that the same [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=264.15999999999997s)]
*  class of workers in different circumstances choose to use. I believe that the JCP's internal [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=275.6s)]
*  struggles were directly born out of the division between the fissures created along the lines of [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=284.88s)]
*  a more peasant style class of, of workers that were interested in more revolutionary tactics. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=291.76s)]
*  And remember this is post-World War II in Japan. So it's not, we're not talking about like a, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=301.44s)]
*  a normal circumstance. We're talking about post-World War II period in Japan, where there's [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=310.16s)]
*  still plenty of remnants of the previous f**kish governance of the Japanese empire at that point [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=314.64s)]
*  and the allies of, of design the country, well, not the allies, specifically the American [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=321.84s)]
*  government has designed the country in its own vision. And it is functionally an occupied [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=328.56s)]
*  nation, which is part of the reason why there was more room for immediate action of this sort. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=334.32s)]
*  As far as I understand the internal divisions also were born out of the, the fractions [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=342.64s)]
*  that even exist in more modern iterations in the Western world, fractions like the intellectual [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=351.04s)]
*  youth supporters of the party in city areas that were revisionist [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=357.92s)]
*  and did not want to engage in any sort of guerrilla campaign. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=367.36s)]
*  In 1958, Kenji Miyamoto became the JCP's leader and moderated the party's policies, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=372.32s)]
*  abandoning the previous line of violent revolution. Miyamoto also began distancing the JCP from the [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=376.16s)]
*  Eastern block in the 1960s and the party maintained a neutral stance during the Sino-Soviet split [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=380.40000000000003s)]
*  and declared its support for multi-party democracy in opposition to the one party [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=384.96s)]
*  policies of China and the Soviet union and purged the pro-Soviet or Chinese members. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=388.47999999999996s)]
*  His efforts began his efforts to regain electoral support were particularly successful in urban [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=392.88s)]
*  areas such as Osaka, Kyoto and Tokyo. And the JCP worked with the Japan socialist party in the 1970s [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=397.2s)]
*  to elect a number of progressive mayors and governors. By 1979, the JCP held about 10% [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=402.64s)]
*  of the seats in the national diet. The party saw brief electoral resurges after the collapse of [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=407.28s)]
*  the JSP, the Japanese social party in 1996. However, the party has generally been in decline [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=411.68s)]
*  in terms of electoral results. The party at present advocates for the establishment of [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=418.96s)]
*  democratic society based on pacifism. It believes that its objective can be achieved by working [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=422.24s)]
*  within an electoral framework while carrying out extra parliamentary struggle against imperialism [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=426.96000000000004s)]
*  and its subordinate ally monopoly capital. As such, the JCP does not advocate violent [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=431.04s)]
*  revolution, but a rather democratic revolution to achieve democratic change in the politics and the [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=437.44s)]
*  economy. It accepts the current constitutional position of the emperor, but opposes the [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=441.12s)]
*  involvement of the imperial house and politics. It's staunchly anti-militarist and JCP firmly [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=444.8s)]
*  supports article nine of the Japanese constitution and ceases all the Japan self-defense forces. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=449.92s)]
*  These are some of the questions that I'm going to be asking them, especially as it pertains to [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=454.72s)]
*  the American ongoing occupation in Japan, the military bases and the number of different [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=458.8s)]
*  issues that the American military bases and American service members cause on Japanese soil [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=464.56s)]
*  and also the recent militarism of any self-defense forces, the recent increase in [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=470.16s)]
*  spending on defense by Japan led by the United States of America in an effort to also maintain [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=477.28000000000003s)]
*  this defensive posture against the rising tide of Chinese style socialism. These are some of [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=483.6s)]
*  the questions I want them to address if possible. But yes, they oppose Japan's understandably [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=490.88s)]
*  oppose Japan's military alliance with the United States is an unequal relationship [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=499.76s)]
*  and infringement of Japan's national sovereignty, which is correct. Okay. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=504.15999999999997s)]
*  They have been outlawed. They have been persecuted, prosecuted throughout its history. And to this [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=519.36s)]
*  day, from what I understand, there is still an air of mass surveillance surrounding all matter of [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=528.08s)]
*  leftist political activity, but specifically even the Japanese communist party, despite them being [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=534.0s)]
*  revisionist and pacifist openly. Okay. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=540.72s)]
*  Cancel all your Japan plans. Another plane crash. Yeah, that's pretty crazy. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=552.6400000000001s)]
*  Wait, what is the JCP stands on Japanese imperialism and nationalism? I've also, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=555.6s)]
*  they are anti-nationalist and anti-imperialist. But while they don't have an issue with the [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=561.2s)]
*  symbolic existence of the emperor, they do not believe the emperor should have any say [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=569.6s)]
*  whatsoever in the efforts in the affairs of the government. Anyway, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=575.76s)]
*  I'm on Dorian is correct. This is actually, this is also one of the things that I want to understand. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=580.4s)]
*  Japan is a dystopian capitalist country that is ripe for socialist ideas. Well, I'm not going to [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=585.52s)]
*  say yet these revisionists blew it, but I want to ask them about that. That Japan is an incredibly, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=589.92s)]
*  I mean, Japan is an incredibly hyper capitalist, dare I say dystopia. And yet it works. And this [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=598.3199999999999s)]
*  is fascinating to someone like myself, because while the contradictions are glaring, it seems like [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=605.6s)]
*  hundreds of years of Japanese culture has been able to maintain the capitalist structure that [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=611.12s)]
*  currently exists in Japan, regardless of all of the many different issues and many different failures [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=616.08s)]
*  that exist within hyper capitalist societies. And I want to understand, I want to understand [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=623.5200000000001s)]
*  how things work in modern Japan and what JCP's intentions are, like what kind of political [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=632.88s)]
*  mobilization they engage in. And is there any way of moving or is there any way through [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=640.8s)]
*  electoralism to move Japan in this direction? What are some of the issues facing modern Japan [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=646.8s)]
*  from the perspective of the Japanese communist party and what they're doing to address some of [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=654.16s)]
*  these issues? So these are some of the things I'm very curious about. So treat this as like, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=659.28s)]
*  maybe a deeper dive and a better understanding of modern Japanese politics. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=665.12s)]
*  So [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=672.4s)]
*  there will be some, there will be a translator there with us. Okay. Fear not. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=693.12s)]
*  And I believe they have English speaking party members as well. I'm currently waiting for March [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=698.16s)]
*  to get here so that, you know, we can watch this. Will you be posting an interview today separately? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=702.48s)]
*  I always go to work when you start the RL portion of the Japan streams. The interview will, of course, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=708.24s)]
*  still, the interview, of course, will be featured on my, my, my YouTube as well. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=712.56s)]
*  Can you ask about their thoughts on immigrants in Japan? I'm an immigrant, by the way. Yes. And [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=728.3199999999999s)]
*  I will field some of your questions as well, as long as they're good ones and not silly ones. Okay. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=732.48s)]
*  So fear not. That's something that we will also talk about as well. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzAokhucGfk&t=737.4399999999999s)]
