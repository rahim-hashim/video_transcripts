# This Guy Addresses The Entire Twitch Platform | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [November 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k)
*  So again, if you want to check it out, Willie Mack's video is great. He covers this topic. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=0.0s)]
*  I would highly recommend you see this to see actual proper journalism and an actual proper objective. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3.68s)]
*  He did not say that's actual proper journalism. This dude has the f**king- oh god. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=10.8s)]
*  This dude has the sentience of a sea cucumber. Oh my god. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=16.16s)]
*  Citizen journalist and- [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=24.96s)]
*  I wanted to see if he's talked about Palestine at all. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=26.8s)]
*  This Israeli company is spying on everyone. Twitch is a disgustingly evil platform. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=30.08s)]
*  1 million views. Tells me- [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=34.0s)]
*  38 minute video. 1 million views. To be fair, Asmongold's being banned might have been a [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=36.16s)]
*  blessing considering Bro finally cleaned his house, which is finally what happens when [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  Discord moms run a multi-million dollar app. I usually avoid these issues and don't take sides [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=43.28s)]
*  because I'm not knowledgeable on the topic, only to immediately proceed labeling people [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=47.44s)]
*  knowledgeable on the subject and speaking out against s**t side polarized extremists. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=50.64s)]
*  Wait, are- is this audience dunking on him for this? This isn't about a son. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  Problem is, the son is the farthest thing from knowledgeable on the subject. There is a reason [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=59.04s)]
*  why he won't debate destiny. He'll eat him alive. That's so awesome. Moodahar trying to both sides [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=62.08s)]
*  and active s**t side will never not be funny to me. Dude, just s**t. Making fun of veterans is just [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=66.64s)]
*  unjustly invaded nature of the behest of an empire is incomparable to an idiotic slob, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=70.16s)]
*  content creator. Asmongold's the worst kind of slob as he barely makes any creative content [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=73.36s)]
*  out of his own. Making an incentive sweeping generalization by victims of s**t society. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=76.0s)]
*  Literacy of the Palestinians came from an interferial culture. No dog whistle, no insinuations. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=79.28s)]
*  I like how he's talking about the US military like he isn't Canadian. Your ramble at the end [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=82.8s)]
*  was really based. I agree. All this hateful content really slowly affects you and just makes [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=86.64s)]
*  you more callous and disappointed in the world. On streams I've maintained this is a conflict that [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=89.84s)]
*  shouldn't exist with the death toll rising and innocence displaced. I would hope this conflict [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=93.76s)]
*  ends at some point before the end of my life. This is how most people treat this complex situation. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=97.84s)]
*  We don't like seeing children. If you asked me on the stream, you'd hear these exact words [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=102.16s)]
*  relayed back at you. If you want to see change, write to your MP and ask them to discuss this on [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=105.52s)]
*  your behalf. 225-2024. The complexity and the nuance of, you know, it's too complex. It's too [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=109.52s)]
*  nuanced. S**t society is too complex and nuanced to have an opinion on. You know what's not too [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  complex and nuanced to have an opinion on though? Talking and besmirching people who actually do [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=124.32s)]
*  talk about the s**t side and saying that Twitch is inconsistent and bad and using like Destiny [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=130.0s)]
*  and Dan Saltman's website to do such a thing. These are the same people, by the way, who f**king [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=138.08s)]
*  despise. Okay. Remember these are the same people who despise these like mass brigading campaigns. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=143.60000000000002s)]
*  These are the same people who love free speech. These are the same people who hate when people [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=150.24s)]
*  engage in this SJW style conquest to get people deplatformed. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=155.60000000000002s)]
*  You know, the centrist guys using a f**king Willy Mag video as a source to say Hasan is out of his [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=160.0s)]
*  depth is also pretty funny or not knowledgeable on issues is also pretty funny. Especially considering [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=172.08s)]
*  that the person who we're using as a source to compile these f**king videos literally does not [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=177.36s)]
*  know a single goddamn thing about Israel, Palestine, Gaza, or any number of different issues. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=182.08s)]
*  Is drama slop compounded on top of drama slop? He says at the end of the video, he's done with [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=188.23999999999998s)]
*  drama content. This is not drama content. This is actively signaling to deplatform a content creator [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=193.68s)]
*  who you're too cowardly to f**king have a genuine opinion on in terms of like the issues that he [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=199.84s)]
*  speaks of. Okay. You don't want to say anything about Gaza. You're too scared. Okay. And I [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=204.24s)]
*  understand that I I'll be very charitable to, to, you know, Brown content creators who get [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=209.76s)]
*  harassed endlessly, especially if they're Muslim too, you know, because I understand the, the space [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=216.32s)]
*  is inherently hostile. I watched it. Muda said, Anne Frank is incomparable to the Houthi kid because [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=222.24s)]
*  Anne Frank dot that's an insane thing. They're both teenagers who experience that you have an [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=226.88s)]
*  issue with that. If you either, a don't believe that the, the famine that Yemen was placed under [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=232.8s)]
*  is, is, you know, real, that they were just not experiencing that at all. Or you just think that [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=239.20000000000002s)]
*  Brown people can't experience s**t. Now it's additionally weird when it's a Muslim Brown guy [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=245.60000000000002s)]
*  who feels that way. It just like shocks me to my core. He's Indian. So yeah. Okay. What you think [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=251.36s)]
*  Indians don't get an endless amount of smoke from races online? What are we talking about? They're [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=258.0s)]
*  like the number one primary target of, of white supremacists, especially online. That's the reason [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=262.56s)]
*  why he had to f**king bail on his, that's the reason why he had to bail on his Twitter account. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=268.24s)]
*  He's Indian and Muslim. He's getting double f**ked. This I think is really f**king cowardly though. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=273.36s)]
*  Okay. Cause like say with your chest, say that you actually like what Israel is doing then, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=279.28s)]
*  or say it's defensible. You know, if that's truly what you believe, you can be that guy, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=284.08s)]
*  be that guy or say what, or say what Israel's doing is indefensible. Don't do this. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=288.24s)]
*  This is lame as f**k hitting it from this silly ass. Like I'm a centrist. Both sides are saying [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=296.0s)]
*  crazy stuff, you know, and everybody needs to be banned or whatever is, is ridiculous. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=303.12s)]
*  It's my least favorite characteristic of a lot of these like drama orbiters. They don't have any [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=309.76s)]
*  sort of like real political convictions. Very, very, very annoying. But I do see that even his [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=315.2s)]
*  own fan base was like, the f**k are you talking about? Mood to heart on a both sides and active. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=320.96s)]
*  It makes me happy to see that there are people in his chat who are like, what are you doing? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=326.08s)]
*  Is it Libyan man? I call bullshit. You are insane. If you really think you're helping anyone by [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=329.76s)]
*  invading and killing innocent people, calling it, they're fighting for freedom. It's just wild. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=333.12s)]
*  And either I lived in Libya before your freedom came, man would die to bring that back. What [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=335.84s)]
*  saying the military is taking a bullet for the people, especially in the United States, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=340.24s)]
*  just plain wrong to be taken a bullet for the people. Your end goal would be to defend them [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=342.71999999999997s)]
*  against some force that initiated an attack while most of your conflicts in the USA takes part in [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=346.15999999999997s)]
*  the world on the initiator side of this. Dude, everyone's shitting on his take even on the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=349.36s)]
*  veteran shit. No way Muda just said that anti-Zionism can be equated with anti-Semitism. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=355.44s)]
*  Bad mouth the people that take a bullet for your freedoms every single day. The most [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=361.68s)]
*  outrageous shit you'll ever hear. Like, dude, this is slop and it works so well. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=366.24s)]
*  Herder, American soldiers are dying so that you can have free speech. Herberberber. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=372.56s)]
*  You don't, how dare you? How dare you bad mouth the American veterans, I say as a Canadian. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=379.03999999999996s)]
*  Downright, you know, just hateful rhetoric. Now, obviously, you know, the people who are in the [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=386.48s)]
*  military were like, whoa, we're getting that Camaro. I have never in a million years met somebody and [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=391.68s)]
*  I've met plenty of friends, you know, friends who are actually active military people that are [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=396.4s)]
*  retired military. At this point, they've done their careers. You know, people that have played [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=400.64s)]
*  video games who've told me about their stories. Never once have I ever heard people jump into the [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=404.71999999999997s)]
*  army for that free juicy Camaro. Ooh, wait, dog, you're Canadian. Why are you talking about this? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=408.8s)]
*  Wait, wait, is he saying that like Americans are not victim to the poverty draft and the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=418.32s)]
*  predatory nature that recruiters operate in? And it's actually because they have this profound [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=425.68s)]
*  sense of duty to what secure in Afghanistan so that the CIA could continue having black budget [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=431.6s)]
*  operation funds is that you don't understand brother. When I went down there to the Karen [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=439.84000000000003s)]
*  golf Valley, okay. And I E D exploded under my Humvee. And because we didn't have armor under the [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=445.68s)]
*  bottom of it for IEDs in the, in the first round of conflict, I knew that I lost my legs specifically [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=452.48s)]
*  so that Americans could have free speech. Like, what do you mean? None of those know what America [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=460.56s)]
*  is or what free speech is like God, YouTubers and their understanding of the world is so infantile. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=467.68s)]
*  It's like a child that watched a Hollywood movie and think like, no, that's what it is. It's not [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=474.64000000000004s)]
*  because American career prospects are dire and plenty of people are trying to escape [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=482.16s)]
*  horrifying conditions, whether it be homelessness, whether it be drug, drug use and abuse at home. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=487.28000000000003s)]
*  And that the military is seen as the only way that they get some sort of upward social mobility. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=494.32s)]
*  And this is of course, outside of the people that go through the officer's program or come from [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=499.36s)]
*  long standing family, you know, military families is there's like three different brackets in the [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=504.72s)]
*  American military across the board in the most reductive ways possible. I can describe it. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=510.64s)]
*  And as a, you know, people that are a victim to the poverty draft, people that want to become [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=515.6s)]
*  Pete Buddha judge and go through the office's program and, you know, inevitably go into office [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=521.28s)]
*  and also people that come from military families. Okay. Like career professional military families. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=528.16s)]
*  Okay. The large chunk of the base of the grunts that while they are, you know, protecting or, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=536.16s)]
*  I don't know, bullying or some shit, those guys are actually a part of the grunt branch that is [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=542.5600000000001s)]
*  escaping poverty, or at least they think they're escaping poverty because the recruiters are lying [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=549.6s)]
*  to them. That is the Camaro wing of the, okay. Those guys think falsely that if they go through [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=554.4s)]
*  basic training and then they get out of basic training and they put their time in the military [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=563.44s)]
*  and they go out and tour, okay. Maybe they'll be able to come back and not have their brain [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=568.08s)]
*  fucking fried and go get a communications degree and enter the shitty ass job market that we all [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=574.4000000000001s)]
*  have entered at the same fucking time. I know, I know these people, I love these people. Many of [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=580.0s)]
*  them are in my community. Okay. I've grown up with these people. It seems like Muddahar has not, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=586.32s)]
*  and he's just making up a false reality that he saw on TV. Oh my God. There are plenty of them [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=592.24s)]
*  who are fucking active duty right now that are still in this community. They know it sucks, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=599.12s)]
*  Dick. They know it's shit. They know it's an awful fucking job. They also think they have no other [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=604.72s)]
*  options and maybe this is what will pay for college. And then also they'll get healthcare. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=611.04s)]
*  Little do they know you either get healthcare, you get 100% coverage. If you're the luckiest [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=616.8s)]
*  person ever, or if you're the unluckiest person ever. But that's besides the point that I'm not [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=621.84s)]
*  even going to get into all of that. Problem is when you're a fucking YouTube IT guy that talks [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=627.44s)]
*  about Linux most of the time and you fucking dive your toe, dip your little toes into the dangerous, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=632.72s)]

*  Reddit post about some tech issue that he that he covers fairly well, I assume. But this is not [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=650.96s)]
*  something that he knows at all. So why the fuck did he do this? Well, I'll tell you why he did this [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=658.4000000000001s)]
*  because he got a million fucking views. Controversial thing that got him a million [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=663.2800000000001s)]

*  shit, talking about global conflict from the perspective of a drama, slop, tuber that gets [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=674.8000000000001s)]

*  views. That's it. Maybe the student loans and as somebody that you know, at the time, financially [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=684.32s)]
*  speaking, I needed money for school, I probably would have joined the Canadian Air Force, you know, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=689.28s)]
*  out of a patriotic duty, but also because, you know, you you sign up, you sign a bond with them, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=693.44s)]
*  you work in the military, you get your school paid for, you know, good schooling. And that's kind of [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=697.76s)]
*  how things, you know, go. It's a deal you end up making. I think a lot of people that join the [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=702.32s)]

*  technologies used to stream your nonsense garbage on the internet. You know, they do a lot more than [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=728.24s)]
*  just this imperialism that she likes to throw around. The imperialism that she likes to throw [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=733.12s)]

*  I will never investigate what it actually means. Okay. Do you understand? Because I have the full [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=746.16s)]
*  knowledge that my audience doesn't know what the fuck it means either. It's something that the woke [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=750.16s)]

*  that it's not just a fucking word that someone is throwing around. And in fact, exactly what America [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=763.6800000000001s)]
*  is doing. Also, I like the subtle notion that like the internet is because of DARPA. So imperialism [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=768.8000000000001s)]
*  is fine. You know what I mean? That's not all the military does. They also invent stuff. Okay, sick. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=775.36s)]
*  How about you invent stuff and don't do the other bad shit then, you know, there is very valid [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=780.96s)]
*  criticisms you can make of the US military. But I think going after the cogs in the machine, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=786.32s)]
*  the people that are the grunts, the foot soldiers is just insane. This kind of rhetoric doesn't [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=790.24s)]
*  really bring anyone together. If anything, all it does is just so more discord and you know, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=794.88s)]
*  so more issues amongst people who are already facing a lot of issues right now. People who are [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=800.24s)]
*  already so divided, you know, this kind of rhetoric doesn't really, you know, portray anything. She [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=805.36s)]
*  might think this is based, but at the end of the day, it's just literally cowardish. Why? Yeah, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=809.6s)]
*  no, it's it's coward. It's cowardish behavior for a job. Be Lebanese person to, you know, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=814.56s)]

*  that you, you look at that and you look at the experiences that you got from that process, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=909.44s)]
*  recognize that it changed you in a pretty meaningful way, and then work against that [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=915.6800000000001s)]

*  extra stupid to be like, yeah, no, you don't understand. We went out there, brother. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=951.76s)]
*  We were, we were knocking down doors and fucking Baghdad so that, so that we could defend America's [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=956.0s)]
*  free speech or America's freedoms. Okay. That 14 year old Iraqi child that was scared shitless [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=962.08s)]

*  tower go down a minute ago. Yeah, I know. I also love the notion that once again, we invaded [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=984.64s)]
*  Afghanistan and Iraq for nine 11, not Saudi Arabia, which I'm not saying we should have invaded [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=990.08s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, but like, you know how interesting 17 of the 19 hijackers are Saudi. They were funded [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=996.0s)]
*  by the Saudi family. We invaded Afghanistan and we invaded Iraq. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1002.56s)]
*  Actually question your patriotism. If these are the actual, you know, people that you're fighting [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1008.16s)]
*  for the people that you're, you know, hoping live their freedoms, right. And in the manner that [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1012.3199999999999s)]
*  they've become so accustomed to and, you know, TIF literally taken for granted, it's just hateful [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1017.76s)]
*  shit that she's spouting. And realistically it just comes from this very one-sided view of the [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1023.3599999999999s)]
*  army or really your country. You know, it feels like a lot of the extreme leftist on the internet [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1028.8s)]
*  have literally just amounted to their policy being America bad. And realistically, Muddahar's lit [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1033.76s)]
*  into my DMs one, one time because he said he gets shit on for having a white wife. Never really [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1039.2s)]
*  looking at any of these things from a nuanced perspective. On a side note, I also love how [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1043.6s)]
*  these people talk about getting universal healthcare for people, which is genuinely a cool [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1047.52s)]
*  thing to see people actually, you know, live and not be indebted to the medical industry or the [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1051.2s)]
*  United States because they happen to get sick or go through something serious. No, your medical [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1056.72s)]
*  rights are only really present as long as you share your political views with us. I mean, how [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1061.2800000000002s)]
*  fucking backwards- I don't think that's what Frogan believes. I don't think that's what anybody [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1065.8400000000001s)]
*  believes really. I mean, I'm- universality means like even if you're a fucking Nazi, you get that [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1069.6000000000001s)]
*  actually. And I do believe that. Rogan is harassed by this loser almost every week and her country [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1076.0800000000002s)]
*  was getting bombed like two days ago until a recent reese fire. I know. Out of touch bullshit [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1081.2s)]
*  is this when you got to hear it, right? It's like, I hope you get PTSD and I hope America doesn't [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1087.04s)]
*  pay for your medical stuff. I mean, they're military people. If you had any basic understanding, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1091.76s)]
*  they probably have earned- Mike believes it all. He says you're too nice. No, I am uncompromising [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1095.76s)]
*  in my values. And I do like that he said universal healthcare. These people defend universal [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1101.68s)]
*  healthcare, but don't want veterans to get it. And that's pretty funny because like, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1108.24s)]
*  if you recognize that they, you know, defend universal healthcare, I think you should understand [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1114.08s)]
*  that on principle alone, you're recognizing that they want everybody to get healthcare. That's what [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1119.44s)]
*  universal means. You know, their medical protections because of the service that they've offered, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1123.84s)]
*  just insane stuff to see. Now, as a matter of fact, if universal healthcare was a thing, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1128.64s)]
*  poverty draft would not be as effective, which is part of the reason why it still exists. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1132.72s)]
*  Upward social mobility can only happen with educational attainment. If free college existed [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1137.36s)]
*  and universal healthcare existed, it will be a lot less likely for people to fucking join the [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1141.92s)]
*  military. A lot of those grunts that we were just talking about, they probably wouldn't join the [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1146.16s)]
*  military. Why the fuck would you? I will Twitch ban this person for, you know, their obvious, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1149.52s)]
*  you know, obvious hateful conduct on the site. Probably not. They're just walking around. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1155.44s)]
*  They did. And also you're demanding they did, but also you're demanding someone get banned. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1160.08s)]
*  You're demanding a content creator get banned. I thought these guys love free speech. Turns out, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1164.64s)]
*  I guess there's limitations of free speech. It just doesn't extend in the opposite direction. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1168.0s)]
*  I doubt that he would be making a YouTube video about fucking neo-Nazis that, that must be banned, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1172.3200000000002s)]
*  you know, completely free. It's insane. Shit guys hate cancel culture, but then also [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1178.0s)]
*  simultaneously love deploying it. Love, love deploying it against people that, you know, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1182.3200000000002s)]
*  their group of friends despise. Let me see how many. So let's see. Maybe I'm wrong. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1189.84s)]
*  Cancel culture. I got canceled over this video. Twitter is horrible. Netflix should be canceled. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1198.6399999999999s)]
*  Sorry. Just killed Concord within two weeks. Game grumps cancellation. Gangus Khan is finally [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1202.72s)]
*  canceled. So he's written a decent, a bit about cancel culture and cancellations in the past. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1206.8s)]
*  I just want to, I just want to see what is this addressing some controversy. Maybe this is a, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1213.36s)]
*  maybe he's talking about this one. He's talking about Palestine in this, which is a disgustingly [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1217.68s)]
*  evil platform. I'm not going to say that that's a pro Palestinian video. Are there any, why is this [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1221.76s)]
*  a Palestine on the mr. B cease and desist? He's using the Palestine tag for clicks. I doubt it. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1226.72s)]
*  It's a bad day for video games. Canada is destroying the internet. Ordinary slop. Yeah. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1232.0s)]
*  Maybe he, maybe he made a lot of pro Palestine videos, but, but he privated them after cause they [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1237.2s)]
*  were too, you know, it's a Laze fair attitude. No, obviously after some backlash, this complete [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1243.6s)]
*  dipshit comes out and goes, I realize that wishing people harm. Isn't the best way to talk about these [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1250.3999999999999s)]
*  issues. Really? Really? He took no, the best way to talk about these issues is be a fucking coward [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1255.76s)]
*  and never say anything about it. And then shit on people who are talking about these issues. When [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1263.9199999999998s)]
*  other people are logging through every little thing that they say so they can find an angle of [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1269.04s)]
*  attack. Wow. And these people are supposed to be the fucking intellectual bastions on the internet. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1274.0s)]
*  Really? You, you, one thing that, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. This is very recent. Like, you know, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1279.84s)]
*  it's like content over calm. They got some pretty big sponsors right over here and saying stuff. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1286.1599999999999s)]
*  So if you look at the actual like tier list, you can see that Arab streamers S Hassan piker, funny, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1290.32s)]
*  Turkish guy is on the Arab list. All right. Then you've got like AB the, the, the actual Arabs. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1295.8400000000001s)]
*  Then of course on the F tier it's, this is where it gets interesting. You've got Ethan Klein and [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1300.88s)]
*  Ben Shapiro. Dude, this is, this is so, this is so desperate to be like, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1306.16s)]
*  me thinks this is anti-Semitism, sweetie. Like if you look at the actual fucking tier list, like Ben [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1314.88s)]
*  Shapiro is very famously anti-Arab. Okay. Ethan Klein, not as famously. Okay. If you look at the [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1320.72s)]
*  actual tier list, there are friends of, you know, frogan and many others on the fucking tier list. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1328.32s)]
*  Words love Sabra. Now Sabra apparently in their eyes is like the, the, they're referring to like [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1336.08s)]
*  a brand of hummus that exists in Israel that it exists in America. I don't even know if it exists [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1341.92s)]
*  in Israel. I mean, I, I assume it's the exist in Israel as well as in occupied territory, it funds [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1348.08s)]
*  the IDF, but also besides that, that's been a longstanding part of a BDS efforts. But having said [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1352.48s)]
*  that, yes, it is a, it is a substitute for not being Arab coded, not being valid in the Arab [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1360.56s)]
*  community. Okay. It is akin to a bunch of black content creators making a tier list. Okay. And [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1367.6s)]
*  on the eight tier putting being valid. Okay. And on the F tier putting raisins in, in fucking a [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1375.92s)]
*  potato salad, something that is as far like who was invited to the cookout tier list. Okay. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1384.64s)]
*  And at the top of that are people who are invited to the cookout, the most valid people. Right. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1391.28s)]
*  And on the bottom are depending on the range of the range of, I guess, anti-black sentiment that [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1398.0s)]
*  they demonstrate. The tier list bottom would be listed as F tier raisins and potato salad. That's [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1404.96s)]
*  it. They would clearly say that be anti-white racism. Yeah. And everyone would fucking laugh [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1410.56s)]
*  at them. The only difference in this circumstance is that antisemitism is a real bigotry. So you get [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1414.72s)]
*  more mileage when you fucking cynically smear people as antisemites because antisemitism is a [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1419.6000000000001s)]
*  real valid bigotry. Anti-white racism, no matter how much certain white identitarians online cry [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1424.72s)]
*  about it, is not, it does not read by normal people as a real fucking valid bigotry. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1430.4s)]
*  Yeah. And then you'd put fucking Candace Owens on the bottom of the F tier in that situation. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1436.72s)]
*  Specifically in part of a boycott. Now, Sabra also translates to Israeli Jew or Jew born in Israel. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1440.88s)]
*  So realistically, you know, if we're going to be, if we're going to use the terminology that [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1447.52s)]
*  these people politically like to use, this is what we consider a dog whistle. Okay. Because- [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1451.44s)]
*  Yeah, dude, that's what they were implying on doing, which by the way, I didn't fucking know [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1457.04s)]
*  either for the record. And Frogan says she didn't know either. I believe her. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1462.24s)]
*  There's one of the tierless makers is Jewish himself, but you know, that's besides the point [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1467.84s)]
*  that he must be a self-hating Jew, right? In reality, this is what they're actually going [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1473.36s)]
*  for. I mean, the thumbnail- It also was loves Sabra, loves Sabra. It grammatically does not make [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1478.1599999999999s)]
*  sense if it was loves a Jewish person born in Israel. I showed you. And again, I wonder if it's [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1484.48s)]
*  loves Sabra Hummus or if it's loves Jewish person born in Israel. And these are the same people that [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1491.68s)]
*  judged me based on the thumbnail that I used for like the Keffles video. So to give you a quick [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1499.6s)]
*  idea of to understand putting two Jews in the F tier kind of gives you an idea of like where they're [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1504.4s)]
*  at. It's giving anti-Semitism, sweetie. It's kind of funny to have this kind of take [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1511.28s)]
*  when like every single one of these like center centrist fence sitting, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1518.48s)]
*  try hard fucking drama slop content creators are so firmly planted in the edgy boy spectrum, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1526.0s)]
*  so firmly planted in the edgiest side of the internet who routinely rail against cancel culture, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1534.96s)]
*  routinely championing being free speech warriors. And actually in many instances, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1540.96s)]
*  we'll look at like real fucking racist shit and be like, Oh, people are misunderstanding my [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1545.9199999999998s)]
*  racist friend Himmler, Groyper 1488. When he said, you know, when he said that like white people are [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1551.4399999999998s)]
*  superior, he was simply talking about something different. He wasn't being serious. Oh, it's just [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1558.72s)]
*  a joke, lol. But then they're like, um, actually, Sabra, as a according to this Wikipedia page means [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1563.6s)]
*  a Jewish person born in Israel. So it's giving anti-Semitism, sweetie. Arab being at the top, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1571.76s)]
*  Jew being at the bottom. Okay. See, Arab and Jew is not different designations. There is literally [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1580.32s)]
*  an Arab Jew on the fucking panel. Oh my God. There is an Arab Jewish person who was banned [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1587.84s)]
*  in this process. Arab and Jew as a designation is created by Israel. That is Israel's classification. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1595.9199999999998s)]
*  Okay. Because Israel is a fascist country with racist demographic concerns. So they have slotted [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1605.36s)]
*  out people of Jewish background, both ethnically and religiously as a specific subsect of society [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1614.64s)]
*  and claim that Arabs are those regardless if they come from the same countries or not, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1624.4s)]
*  Arabs are those who are not. Okay. This is not an Arab Jew classification. Notice how you had to [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1630.48s)]
*  go through different hoops to be like, yeah, this very obvious thing, the Sabra hummus love [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1642.88s)]
*  Sabra hummus in this tier list to determine whether someone is valid and Arab coded is actually [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1648.24s)]
*  racist and anti-Semitic. Notice how you had to jump through 11 different fucking hoops because [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1655.8400000000001s)]
*  that's not what the intention was. And that's not what anybody actually thought it was. It was a [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1660.0s)]
*  goddamn Twitch approved panel at Twitch con months ago. I can look at this and immediately [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1664.88s)]
*  understand that this is most definitely designed to be. He literally laughed that you were top of [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1671.04s)]
*  the list. This is so-called Arabs at the top, Jewish people at the bottom. I know that's the [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1675.6s)]
*  most Reddit thing you can do. Remember is the very Reddit thing. You land on a faulty premise [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1679.6s)]
*  and then you add on and you start cracking jokes off of that faulty premise. Like these idiots [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1685.28s)]
*  don't even understand. Like Hassan is not even an Arab. He's Turkish. It's like, yeah, maybe that [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1690.72s)]
*  should cause you to re-examine your perspective. You know, no, I will not be doing that. I'm just [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1696.96s)]
*  going to be a smug fucking dipshit and cynically behave as though it actually was secretly a dog [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1702.32s)]
*  whistle to be fucking anti-Semitic. This is what is so goddamn frustrating about this process too, [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1708.32s)]
*  because there are a shit ton of out and about anti-Semites out there. They do not see any reason [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1714.96s)]
*  to try and dog whistle. Or if they do dog whistle, they don't dog whistle around Israel. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1721.04s)]
*  Okay. They dog whistle by saying, Ooh, I'm noticing how many Jews are in positions of power. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1727.2s)]
*  That type of shit. Okay. That's what a fucking real dog whistle is. I know this because I combat [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1733.44s)]
*  and target anti-Semitism historically for the past 10 fucking years. While you guys spent all that [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1740.32s)]
*  time hanging out with fucking neo-Nazis online and getting chummy with them. That's the difference. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1746.96s)]
*  The hateful rhetoric, right? Like no matter how you want to cut and slice it, if I had done this [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1752.24s)]
*  or anybody had done this or people who are opposed politically to these people would do it. They [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1758.08s)]
*  would say that this is hateful conduct. This is literally hateful conduct occurring on the platform. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1763.1200000000001s)]
*  Now, yeah, this is the hateful conduct, dude. Yeah, for sure. Oh, he's going to get to the [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1768.8s)]
*  Huthi video. Let's see. Like music video and like playing sitting with another actual streamer. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1773.6799999999998s)]
*  And when you watch it, he's literally walking away and like playing literal like traders. Now [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1778.3999999999999s)]
*  I was actual terror, like music videos to like random creators. Now I was to do this on YouTube [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1783.84s)]
*  or really any other platform or even Twitch. I would actually be expecting a band, you know, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1790.56s)]
*  a couple would you those fucking YouTube, those videos are on YouTube. They're on Twitter. It's a, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1795.6799999999998s)]
*  it's a video that's hosted on YouTube and Twitter. It's not akin to ISIS, dumbass. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1801.28s)]
*  Well, like about a year or two ago, like I was actually assisting a couple smaller YouTubers [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1806.6399999999999s)]
*  who basically had memes. There are literal neo-Nazis on YouTube. What the fuck are you talking about? [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1811.28s)]
*  Apparently some of them even may, maybe not neo-Nazis, but some YouTubers even sit around [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1816.56s)]
*  and do reviews of child porn, drawn child porn, hentai, lolly con. That's how little [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1822.16s)]
*  YouTube gives a shit about their own terms of service. You know, Mudahar should know that [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1831.92s)]
*  seemingly he participated in a review of lolly con himself. Where they had like literal actual [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1843.3600000000001s)]
*  meme channels where they had like actual, like, you know, I think it was like ISIS music and [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1850.1599999999999s)]
*  YouTube immediately after detecting it, there's a difference between fucking ISIS music and the [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1855.1999999999998s)]
*  onslaught of lob movement or fucking Yemeni people making music videos. Oh my God. Completely [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1860.3999999999999s)]
*  demonetized accounts. In some cases they would actually remove videos or even ban people [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1866.8799999999999s)]
*  because YouTube went through a serious apocalypse in regarding this. And obviously I think most [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1871.1999999999998s)]
*  platforms understand that, you know, highlighting illegal criminal organizations, they don't even [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1876.08s)]
*  have to be terrorists. They can be literal criminal gangs. Like, you know, if you're out there [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1880.3999999999999s)]
*  promoting the Hell's Angels or you're promoting the Mexican drug cartels, you would probably get [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1883.9199999999998s)]
*  a serious ban. You Mrs. Hags at Allah Akbar memes. But in this situation Twitch's largest political [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1888.48s)]
*  streamer, left-wing political streamer can just fucking out. Clean your fucking shirt, man. What [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1893.6s)]
*  the fuck is this disrespectful ass bullshit, by the way? Jesus Christ. You're like spitting all [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1897.9199999999998s)]
*  over yourself while you're fucking doing this commentary. How fucking gross. Oh my God. What a [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1902.32s)]
*  goddamn slob, dude. You got fucking cum stains on your fucking t-shirt talking about shit that you [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1907.84s)]

*  tonsil stones on his shirt. Jesus. Right. You know, promote this kind of stuff on the platform. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1920.0s)]
*  And it's not even just that. It gets to a point where like, imagine being a political streamer [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1928.6399999999999s)]
*  and you bring a actual pirate, a actual criminal, onto your streams. And instead of, you know, [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1933.84s)]

*  Yawn. I can't believe it. You hit a- Yeah. An actual pirate. No, he's not an actual pirate. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1946.08s)]
*  Okay, he's not an actual criminal. M.O.D.S. He's a criminal. Once again, 10 months ago, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1953.92s)]
*  once again, every fucking other outlet has also interviewed him. And also, they didn't fucking call [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1961.8400000000001s)]
*  him a Huthy either. You want to know why? Because he's not one. And it would be ridiculous for them [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1968.64s)]
*  to say that if he's not it. Okay. About 32 minutes. Watch this clip. They like, they went over the [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1973.6000000000001s)]
*  the cruise on these ships and they like, like win them over with their charm and they make them [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1981.84s)]
*  hate America. This is him talking about, this is him talking about what the Ansarallah, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1987.52s)]
*  the Huthys are doing. It's not something he did. We know he didn't do this. Okay. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1993.12s)]
*  The US government. That's so funny. Think about China. Does he know anything about China? [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=1997.92s)]
*  He's saying he hasn't spent much time with Chinese people, but one of the captains, [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2003.04s)]
*  the captain was Chinese and he, he did caught with them and he. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2006.88s)]
*  That's not true. This is like objectively false. Okay. For the record. Holy shit. This was like 50 [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2012.48s)]
*  pounds ago for you. No, it wasn't. I just have a big beard there. But that's besides the point. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2018.96s)]
*  Like, as far as I understand, there was not even a single fucking there was not a single ship [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2024.8000000000002s)]
*  captain that was Chinese out of any of the apprehended ships. He wasn't a part of any of [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2029.6000000000001s)]
*  the apprehensions anyway, the music with them and he was vibing. So he, he, he, he likes him. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2034.8s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, what, that's so crazy. So they're just fucking chilling with the captains. Like, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2040.08s)]
*  I don't understand. Yeah. I just want to reiterate that we're talking about somebody that has been [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2045.9199999999998s)]
*  taken hostage who quote unquote is being chilled with. And again, this is just right on Twitch. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2051.2s)]
*  America's like bomb. So America's like blowing them up while they're just like doing cat and, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2056.8s)]
*  and fucking chilling with the captains. Like, how does he feel about that? Isn't that crazy? [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2060.8s)]
*  Like, I don't know how to describe these clips were seen eight months ago on Willie Max channel, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2064.16s)]
*  but you can watch this video right now. Please go watch Willie Max channel. He knows everything [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2068.48s)]
*  about the subject. He doesn't know shit. He doesn't know anything. I watched the piece that bad [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2073.2s)]
*  empanada watched and I was shocked at how stupid he was. I thought it was like, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2078.3999999999996s)]
*  I thought there was at least like, uh, some, some like disagreements, you know what I mean? [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2082.7999999999997s)]
*  Like I thought there, there had to have been some kind of like, uh, ideological disagreements there. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2089.6s)]
*  No, not even is just a dumb ass half the video is shit that he literally clipped to claim. I'm [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2095.2s)]
*  advocating for when I'm advocating against that very position. I did not even know that half of [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2102.56s)]
*  these fucking Hassan is pro Russia content creators were literally just operating on not understanding [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2108.8s)]
*  anything I'm saying or not knowing anything about the issue at all. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2115.44s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I, I'm, I'm not, I, the interview itself has journalistic value. I'm not a journalist. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2126.08s)]
*  I'm a commentator. Also is Willie Mack doing journalism? Like what's happening? [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2133.92s)]
*  Yeah. The guys, the state that is implementing a blockade on the red sea in an effort to stop [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2145.36s)]
*  the genocide is actually putting people in harm's way. Not the fucking state that is doing a genocide [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2155.1200000000003s)]
*  and not America and all of the other fucking coalition forces that started blowing up Yemen [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2162.56s)]
*  because they decided to fucking stop ships from going through the red sea because they wanted to [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2169.12s)]
*  enforce some kind of penalty for the genocide that Israel was conducting. Oh my God. Thank you. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2175.6s)]
*  I'm glad that you arrived at a reasonable conclusion. It's actually, yeah. Why does nobody [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2185.68s)]
*  want to talk about the Warsaw ghetto uprising and the violence that these Jewish people in the [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2191.92s)]
*  ghettos were subjecting the Germans to? Oh, the horror. Why is nobody talking about the allied [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2197.12s)]
*  coalition forces in world war two, the bombing of Dresden unacceptable? Why won't anybody think about [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2204.08s)]
*  the poor Nazis that might've been harmed in the process? Now, of course, the merchant ships are [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2212.0s)]
*  not Nazis. Okay. And I would never advocate to harm the people on these ships. They are putting [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2220.4s)]
*  a blockade on the red sea. They very clearly have said that their goals is to stop Israel from [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2226.88s)]
*  harming Palestinians further. This is an understandable and dare I say just goal. Okay. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2235.2000000000003s)]
*  That's it. And in the words of Norm Finkelstein, who talks about his parents, who are Holocaust [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2242.6400000000003s)]
*  survivors, quite a bit, when he talks about this specific comparison to the Ansar Allah movement, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2250.64s)]
*  to the Yemeni Puthis and what they are doing in the red sea, he asks, if you had the opportunity [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2258.72s)]
*  as a state to stop the Holocaust and you took actions such as a blockade that disrupted [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2264.48s)]
*  German supply lines, for example, would I sit back and say, how dare you do that? Or would I champion [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2274.08s)]
*  that cause? And the answer is clear for many people. The answer is pretty clear. And that's kind of [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2282.0s)]
*  what I try to communicate to people who usually approach the subject matter with the exact same [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2288.24s)]
*  idiotic fucking perspective that this dumb ass Mouda is implementing here. Brown guy terrorist, [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2294.3999999999996s)]
*  bad. They're doing piracy. It's unacceptable. We never have that same principle for America's [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2300.48s)]
*  blockade. America's literally overtaken shipping tankers between Venezuela or Cuba and Iran. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2304.88s)]
*  The Cuba blockade is unjustifiable and inhumane. The blockade implemented by the Huthis in the red [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2313.6000000000004s)]
*  sea is perfectly moral and perfectly understandable. It is there to stop a genocide. And it has been [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2321.04s)]
*  successful in spite of the billions of dollars that the American Navy spent on Operation [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2329.04s)]
*  Prosperity Guardian. They have disrupted trade from the Red Sea so significantly that all of [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2335.52s)]
*  those ships had to go around the Horn of Africa rather than directly cut through the Red Sea. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2341.7599999999998s)]
*  It bankrupted one of Israel's ports. This is one of the least violent ways in which you can resist [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2347.92s)]
*  against an ongoing genocide. Yeah, America literally carpet bombed Yemen's capital, [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2355.36s)]
*  Sanaa, in response to the blockade. Israel itself has also instituted a violent blockade for the [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2360.32s)]
*  past two decades around Gaza, not allowing Gazan fishermen to go beyond the six mile boundary [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2365.1200000000003s)]
*  and even actually killing humanitarian aid ships like the Turkish one, Mavi Marmara, [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2371.92s)]
*  and killing all of the humanitarian aid organizers that were on that ship for penetrating the Israeli [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2378.32s)]
*  blockade instituted upon the Gazan shores. That is an example of an unjustifiable blockade. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2384.48s)]
*  Now, here's the problem. Here's the issue. I'm willing to bet if I were to be like, hey, [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2391.44s)]
*  Moudahar, let's say country A is genociding a group of people that they've held captive in [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2396.32s)]
*  an area B, okay? Area B has a reason to want emancipation. Area B has reason to demand [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2403.92s)]
*  sovereignty and become a nation state all on its own. It is not allowing that to happen and also [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2411.76s)]
*  doing a genocide, okay? If country C decides to put an end to that by implementing a blockade [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2417.6800000000003s)]
*  and restrict trade with country A, do you agree with that? If I were to ask him that, I'm sure [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2424.5600000000004s)]
*  that he wouldn't say, no, I don't. I disagree with that. I think that you shouldn't fight against [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2429.36s)]
*  Nazi Germany and try to stop its trade routes so that they can resupply themselves. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2436.72s)]
*  I'm sure that he would say that that is a valid and moral thing, but you don't have to ever have [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2445.2799999999997s)]
*  that argument. If you just go, these guys are terrorists, they're bad, they're wrong, they're [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2451.2s)]
*  brown, they're doing piracy, they're fucked up, and then move on. You don't ever have to come on, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2454.72s)]
*  Nazi really? Yes, Nazi really. What the fuck do you mean? An ultra nationalist ideology, [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2460.48s)]
*  committing an apartheid and partitioning an ethnic and religious minority in direct [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2466.0s)]
*  contravention of international law and then also conducting a genocide? Yes, Nazi really. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2472.32s)]
*  You can't have a fucking ethnostate built around the principles of ethnic and religious superiority [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2479.04s)]
*  and then enact that fascist ideology in violent ways and then go, whoa, Nazi? Hello? It is. As [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2485.68s)]
*  exactly what it is. The problem is people, I don't think even understand what Nazism is [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2495.52s)]
*  or think it's bad for the wrong reasons, I guess. The fuck is wrong with you? [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2502.0s)]
*  Fascism is a violent suicidal ideology. It doesn't matter who's holding the gun. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2506.32s)]
*  It doesn't matter who's in the crosshairs of said gun. Okay. So yes, the comparison between [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2511.6s)]
*  Nazism and Zionism is perfectly apt and it's not one that I made alone for the first time ever. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2517.8399999999997s)]
*  You're not from Europe. What? Dude, why are every, why is every European liberal like this? I can't, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2525.9199999999996s)]
*  I can never tell if they're flexing or not. I can never. Oh shit. I made him a mod on accident [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2531.2799999999997s)]
*  and I'm banning him, but what is this? Oh my God. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2538.48s)]
*  We finally have a real cop as a mod, dude. Nazi ideology. How dare you fucking say that, lad? [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2541.6s)]
*  Nothing to do with the Israeli conflict in general. So again, if you want to check it out, [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2552.16s)]
*  Willie Max- Wait, it's nothing to do with the Israeli conflict in general? [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2556.96s)]
*  Like when there are actually just pirates and terrorists who are putting people in harm's way, [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2560.3199999999997s)]
*  especially people that have nothing to do with the Israeli conflict in general. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2564.7999999999997s)]
*  So again, if you want to check it out, Willie Max video is great. He covers this topic. I would [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2568.64s)]
*  highly recommend you see this to see actual proper journalism and an actual proper objective. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2572.48s)]
*  Objective. He did not say that's actual proper journalism. This dude has the fucking, [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2577.52s)]
*  Oh God, this dude has the sentience of a sea cucumber. Oh my God. Coverage of the situation. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2583.92s)]
*  So he brings this kid. Wait, the highlighted text access is the opposite. The last doesn't who the [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2590.0s)]
*  attacks on merchant traffic in the Red Sea have not targeted ships linked to, or at least heading [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2594.48s)]
*  to or from Israel. In contrast, the claims of the Iranian bad group, the U S naval forces, [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2597.44s)]
*  central command told reporters, yeah, no, they're, this was when they were trying to make it seem [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2601.12s)]
*  like it was like, Oh, this has nothing to do with Israel. They're just randomly doing this because [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2604.96s)]
*  Cuthy's love fucking doing piracy. They just love doing, they just love doing a piracy. That's it. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2609.28s)]
*  They love it. That's why they're doing it. It's weird that they didn't do it until Israel started, [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2616.08s)]
*  you know, doing genocide in Gaza. It's just weird. And it's weird that they also kept saying like, [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2621.84s)]
*  you know, we're only implementing this blockade because of the genocide in Gaza. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2627.52s)]
*  It's just weird that they just keep saying that. But as long as nobody fucking, you know, [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2631.6s)]
*  as long as nobody hears that, here's my source, U S central command, get on and basically, you know, [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2635.7599999999998s)]
*  talks about one piece, you know, they have a whole like gag and everything. And the thing about this [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2641.68s)]
*  kid is, which also is really weird that they weren't doing this to harm Israeli trade as it's [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2646.08s)]
*  instituting a genocide, but it just seemingly bankrupt one of the Israeli ports. Yeah, they [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2652.72s)]
*  just hate boats, bro. You don't understand the fucking, the Houthis just hate boats. They don't [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2658.08s)]

*  an influencer called Tim Houthi Shalime. Okay, so the Houthi's called this what everybody in the [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2670.56s)]
*  Western world called him, myself included, because he looks like fucking Timothy Shalime. Basically, [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2675.8399999999997s)]
*  a movement where again, this kid is part of a piracy organization where you can see him literally. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2680.4s)]
*  Yeah, I'm glad that he's doing objective journalism that he got from Willie Mack, [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2686.1600000000003s)]
*  which is by the way, literally read a single fucking news report on this. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2689.28s)]
*  Not a single thing that this man has said is correct. Not a single thing that he has said is [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2693.84s)]
*  correct. Bro, didn't you have this guy on like seven or eight months ago? Why is he still a thing? [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2698.7200000000003s)]
*  He's still a thing. Well, he's not really a thing. It's just these guys want to make him into a thing, [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2703.2000000000003s)]
*  because they think it's a it's a solid way to attack me and demand I get banned. But in a way [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2708.16s)]
*  where it's like, Oh, I'm just pointing out the inconsistencies in terms of service. Yeah. I was [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2713.44s)]
*  on a British hate small boat. Houthi hate big boat. Yeah, that's that's how it works is a is a part of [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2718.48s)]
*  is a shameless hit piece. A organized effort to try and get me deplatformed. It didn't fucking work. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2723.3599999999997s)]
*  And now I'm looking at it because I didn't have time to look at it before. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2731.68s)]
*  Really on like actual captured vessels. And it's not something that's like a hidden secret. He [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2734.64s)]
*  brought this guy on and basically popularized him. Now. Yeah, yeah, yeah, we I popularized the [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2741.04s)]
*  onslaught Allah movement, baby. I made him I made him go viral. The Hassan camp go but Muda. This [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2747.84s)]
*  kid has seen only suffering his entire life. So obviously, you know, he's going to be part of these [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2755.68s)]
*  situations. And, you know, you're being a little bit harsh. Now, I am one of those people that is [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2760.4s)]
*  empathetic towards individuals. And obviously, this kid has only ever seen death and destruction [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2764.96s)]
*  in his entire life. Because the Saudi Yemen conflict, then yes, I can understand why they [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2769.2000000000003s)]
*  would do such a thing. But never in a million years should you as a content creator or a [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2774.1600000000003s)]
*  journalist, I guess, or a political commentator, ever bring somebody on and kind of popularize [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2778.48s)]
*  these things. Okay, these people are ultimately part of a criminal operation and enterprise, [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2783.6000000000004s)]
*  a terrorist movement that you should never do a podcast with someone who's a serial lolly con [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2788.72s)]
*  enjoyer, for example, you know what I mean? Year in year, year in year out, who also happens to be [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2793.3599999999997s)]
*  a fucking genocide denier and a genocide lover as a matter of fact, because they're super fucking [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2798.48s)]
*  pro Israel on top of a litany of other problems. And I actually went on that podcast and I didn't [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2802.7999999999997s)]
*  know any of this shit by the way, but I'm sure that his podcast co-host would have very fucking [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2807.7599999999998s)]
*  familiar with his, you know, the full breadth of his perspective, especially considering the fact [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2812.16s)]
*  that they apparently sat in a fucking discord and enjoyed the lolly con together and criticized it, [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2815.92s)]
*  I guess. Many of them brainwashed into these groups. Yeah, dude, he's brainwashing to being [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2823.04s)]
*  fucking pro Palestine. Shouldn't be glorified. Remember, this person is not even a fucking [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2827.76s)]
*  Houthi. He's just operating on this false premise is a lie. It's wrong. It's just incorrect. I don't [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2833.04s)]
*  know how else to describe it. And it's not similar to interviewing like Bin Laden back in 1997 with [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2838.96s)]
*  CNN. These are situations where even back then these were interviews done respectfully and it [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2844.8s)]
*  wasn't in a way to glorify in 1997 when Bin Laden was interviewed, he was not, I mean, he was, [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2850.2400000000002s)]
*  I believe he was still considered a brave anti-socialist warrior. Was he not? Or was this [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2856.88s)]
*  after the first not, not the nine 11, but the, yeah, I'm pretty sure that the, the interview, [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2864.32s)]
*  the interviews conducted with Osama Bin Laden originally were, yeah, were very positive in 1993. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2869.68s)]
*  The original one that I'm thinking of is from the independent by Robert Fisk, who called him a [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2876.56s)]
*  anti-Soviet warrior puts his army on the road to peace. But I think by 97, he'd already done some [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2883.12s)]
*  attacks. Fisk interviewed Bin Laden again in 1996. He'd just been exiled from Sudan and was back in [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2889.36s)]
*  Afghanistan. The interviews conducted 10 days after bombing Al Khabar Saudi Arabia, killed 19 [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2894.7999999999997s)]
*  US soldiers. And though responsibility for that attack has been attributable Al Qaeda and Iran, [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2899.36s)]
*  Bin Laden told Fisk that this doesn't mean declaring war against the West and Western people, [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2903.6800000000003s)]
*  but against the American regime, which is against every American. The explosion in Al Khabar did not [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2906.7200000000003s)]
*  come as a direct reaction to the American occupation, but as a result of American behavior [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2911.2000000000003s)]
*  against Muslims, it's supportive Jews in Palestine and the massacres of Muslims in Palestine and [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2914.4s)]
*  Lebanon. During one of Fisk's interviews with Bin Laden, Fisk noted an attempt by Bin Laden [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2918.2400000000002s)]
*  to convert him. Bin Laden said, Mr. Robert, one of our brothers had a dream that you were a spiritual [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2921.84s)]
*  person. This means you were a true Muslim. That's funny. The interview he's talking about, [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2926.32s)]
*  I believe is probably the CNN one because Bin Laden has been interviewed a shit load of times. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2930.7200000000003s)]
*  And this was after he declared jihad on the United States. And in the interview, Peter Arnett asked, [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2934.96s)]
*  what are your future plans? Bin Laden said, you'll see them and hear about them in the media. God [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2940.2400000000002s)]
*  willing. CNN producer Peter Bergen, who produced Bin Laden's interview with Arnett was also present [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2945.6000000000004s)]
*  during this interview. And it became the inter first television interview in which Bin Laden [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2950.2400000000002s)]
*  declared war against the United States for a first time to a Western audience. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2954.24s)]
*  Now that's Osama Bin Laden. He did nine 11. Okay. He's not a random 19 year old Yemeni teenager. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2959.2799999999997s)]
*  Who's like, I only care about the genocide in Gaza. And I'm with anyone, no matter what their [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2964.9599999999996s)]
*  background is that wants to put an end to this genocide in Gaza, the genocide of the Palestinians, [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2971.6s)]
*  not only that, but also even if he was a fucking card carrying Houthi militant at the time, [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2978.4799999999996s)]
*  he was still not officially a part of the state sponsored terrorism designation. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2983.6s)]
*  According to the state department, because the Biden administration had actually taken off the [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2987.44s)]
*  onslaught a lot movement from the state sponsored terror designation. In 2021, the Biden administration [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2991.2s)]
*  had actually recently moved to put them back on the state sponsored terror designation. However, [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=2999.52s)]
*  that was going to kick in 30 days in 30 days after they had officially made that declaration, [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3004.64s)]
*  not entirely certified interviewed this person who was not a Houthi, but even if he was a Houthi, [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3010.08s)]
*  it still wouldn't have been me interviewing someone who was a card carrying terrorist in [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3014.3199999999997s)]
*  that regard. I have, however, watched interviews that very important journalists have conducted [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3018.08s)]
*  with people who are considered card carrying terrorist leaders like Yahuasin war, for example, [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3025.2799999999997s)]
*  Yahuasin war was, you know, before Israel killed him, the official leader of Hamas, both the military [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3031.44s)]
*  and also the Politburo chief after Israel killed the Politburo chief. The reason why I'm actually [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3040.72s)]
*  adding all of this background information is because people who watch interviews or people [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3045.52s)]
*  who watch videos like Mouda Harz drama slop don't know a single fucking thing about these issues. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3050.8s)]
*  And they just go, this guy, this leftist, lip, tarred fucking interviewed terrorists and sucked [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3056.88s)]
*  them off. I hate them. And then they come in here and try to repeat that same exact dumb ass bullshit [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3062.8s)]
*  in my chat. Okay. So baffling on the most mediocre Chito does come staying covered man can say, [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3068.08s)]
*  don't fuck coworker takes online, but because he says it confidently, people think he's correct [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3073.6800000000003s)]
*  or smart because there's a lot of fucking dumb fuck, Cheeto crusted dusty ass motherfuckers out [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3076.88s)]
*  there who also hold those same views. And they love watching other people say it back. It makes [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3081.2s)]
*  people feel smart for their stupidity. That's what it is. Anybody who is part of a seriously [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3087.2799999999997s)]
*  criminal operation that isn't designated just by one country, but by a consortium of countries, [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3092.56s)]
*  even countries that are diametrically opposed to each other, you know, politically, these are [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3097.8399999999997s)]
*  actual interviews that people do with criminals as a way to story. It's not meant to glorify somebody [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3102.56s)]
*  or glorify their causes of something just. Yeah. Muddahar, would you have the same smoke for someone [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3108.16s)]
*  that is in your orbit that you love a lot? You know, giving glazing interviews to someone that's, [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3113.92s)]
*  I don't know, maybe conducting a genocide. Maybe someone who actually went and visited the country [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3120.3999999999996s)]
*  that is currently conducting the genocide and actually sat down with officials that were in the [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3124.96s)]
*  process of conducting said genocide. Would you be like, man, it's really fucked up that this guy is [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3129.6s)]
*  glazing terrorists. I doubt that possibly because you don't have any issue with people being pro-Israel. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3135.76s)]
*  You know, in a way it's like presenting people like Sneak O'Randor Tate, who I've made videos on [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3140.2400000000002s)]
*  in the past. It's like if I promote them or talk about them on my channel, it's usually with a very [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3146.0800000000004s)]
*  objective view. It's usually with a very careful view where obviously if they promote bad ideologies, [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3150.7200000000003s)]
*  right? Like, he's been talking about one thing based off a lie he made over the past five minutes [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3156.0s)]
*  of the video. I know. It's about sitting there and deconstructing it with actual facts and logic [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3159.36s)]
*  instead of, you know, sitting down and kind of, you know, hype-beasting it. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3164.88s)]
*  Why do these fucking people that don't know a single damn thing about any of these issues [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3168.32s)]
*  choose to make these fucking videos and just chirp without literally not even doing the bare [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3173.12s)]
*  minimum research necessary to fucking understand any of these things? It's actually shocking. I [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3179.12s)]
*  really should be tackling these fucking slop farmers a little bit harder, especially when they dip [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3184.88s)]
*  their toes in the political arena a little bit, but they do it in this like insanely annoying [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3191.04s)]
*  centrist way too, where it's like, they're so scared of taking a position that they can only [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3195.92s)]
*  fucking talk about geopolitics while playing this fucking old ass video game in the background. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3201.68s)]
*  And they can only cover these issues from the framework of drama and like Twitch's terms of [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3208.64s)]
*  service is so stupid. God damn, we are making an entire generation of people intellectually [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3214.48s)]
*  uncurious to the point where you're normalizing it to a whole bunch of communities, right? [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3221.2s)]
*  You know, it's like hosting a neo-Nazi on your actual channel and not combating them on their [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3225.68s)]
*  terrible beliefs or their violent or extremist beliefs, right? You have to be able to counter [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3230.88s)]
*  these people. If you're willing to platform them. I know it'd be really fucking really bad. If you [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3236.32s)]
*  were like friendly with a neo-Nazi, like if you went and got chicken and waffles with them, [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3241.04s)]
*  if you openly admitted that you gave his phone number to other podcasters, so we could go on all [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3246.08s)]
*  these other fucking go on all these other podcasts and shows, it'd be really bad. If someone that [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3250.16s)]
*  you're friends with someone that you really like mood, a horror, if, if it, you know, if it came [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3256.24s)]
*  out that that person that you were friends with was like fucking a white nationalist, like Lawrence [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3262.16s)]
*  Southern while also simultaneously collaborating with other Nazi pedophiles like Sam Hyde, or [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=3266.08s)]

*  wasn't her son that she was holding. It was simply her son's arm. Okay. That is the daily reality for [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4162.0s)]

*  Yes, I know she died at a young age. I think, yeah, 15. I know. Like, what are you doing? You're [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4622.4s)]
*  doing civility politics for Anne Frank now? What the fuck is this? And there are plenty of examples [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4629.44s)]
*  of people who also died fighting too during the Holocaust. And we understandably celebrate their, [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4635.12s)]
*  you know, celebrate those acts. And it's weird because like, you know, it's in one of these [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4641.2s)]
*  situations where when it comes to like people like Hassan, you know, we've had him on like the [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4645.92s)]
*  podcast, the Some Ordinary Podcast, one of the first actual like, you know, big guests. And on [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4649.76s)]
*  that show, what's insane to me is like, look, people like Frogan, people like Asmongold, [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4654.8s)]
*  I would say they're pretty stupid in understanding these situations. I'm stupid. Hassan, however, [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4658.88s)]
*  is not. This guy knows better, yet he just purposely goes and off you- [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4664.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, if that's the case, then maybe listen to my fucking words, dumbass, instead of repeating what [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4669.280000000001s)]
*  some other goddamn haters are saying. Try to understand what I'm saying. You are arriving at [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4674.48s)]
*  that point to begin with. I guess the only issue we have here is that he's just like automatically, [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4680.5599999999995s)]
*  oh, this guy's a hoot, he's a pirate, he's a hoot, he's a pirate, he's a hoot, he's a pirate, [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4685.5199999999995s)]
*  that's bad, he's bad, he's a bad guy. They're doing piracy for the sake of piracy. These guys just love [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4688.5599999999995s)]
*  doing piracy. That's why they're doing it. He skates things like this. It's insane. Now, again, [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4693.04s)]
*  I don't want to jump and make this like a super political video because again, I'm not equipped to [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4699.04s)]
*  even discuss this kind of stuff, but I am so- You're 30 minutes in! What are you doing? [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4703.44s)]
*  You can't say that 30 minutes into a video! You aren't! You aren't equipped to have this [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4708.719999999999s)]
*  conversation! That's insane, dude! It comes out, I can't be wrong, but this expert should know [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4713.44s)]
*  better. I am right, even though I'm stupid. Delirious and insane, right? No, he's so close [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4718.32s)]
*  to arriving at the truth of the matter, which is yes, you are stupid, and yes, you are not [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4722.639999999999s)]
*  knowledgeable on this issue, and yes, I do know more than you on this issue, but instead of being [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4727.12s)]
*  like, I wonder where he's coming from. Maybe there's more to this commentary over the course [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4731.92s)]
*  of fucking 10 hours. No, I will not investigate this further. He's a terrorist. You love terrorists. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4736.4800000000005s)]
*  You love doing piracy. The Yemeni population across the board are just like epigenetically locked [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4742.8s)]
*  into their destiny, their predetermined destiny of doing piracy on the Red Sea, even though they [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4749.12s)]
*  didn't do it before the Gaza genocide. You can't take a dick out of your mouth for a half hour and [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4753.4400000000005s)]
*  then say, I'm not trying to be gay here. Listen, I know I've been sucking this cock real good for [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4759.2s)]
*  the past 30 minutes, but no homo. No homo! Somebody that has basically been seeing a lot of this, [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4764.4s)]
*  like, you know, insane side of the internet effectively take over and become so normalized. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4771.2s)]
*  Yeah, I know, the insane side of the internet, the fucking anti-genocide side of the internet [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4776.48s)]
*  is so insane, dude. Why can't people make reasonable criticisms of Israel's metric ton of [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4781.28s)]
*  death and destruction and child mutilation machine? Wow. Yeah, why can't they have reasonable [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4788.48s)]
*  takes like me who said it's too complex for me? I'll stay out of it. In the situation, you know, [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4794.0s)]
*  like I've said before, and I've been clipped a few times and you know, even when I stream, [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4799.5199999999995s)]
*  you know, videos do get uploaded of my takes on situations that I feel like I need to clarify. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4803.599999999999s)]
*  I'm not somebody that is afraid to say that genocide is wrong. I think that there is an actual [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4809.12s)]
*  case of genocide and there's an actual case of attack that goes towards the Palestinian people. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4815.76s)]
*  I think there's very serious situations that go around the world. Now, at the same time, [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4820.4800000000005s)]
*  these are situations that involve, you know, a group of people, Muslims and Jews, [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4825.2s)]
*  that have effectively been at each other's throats for not... [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4829.360000000001s)]
*  Guys, you could say, one could say that Palestinians are experiencing what could be [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4832.4s)]
*  considered the first steps of contextually appropriate framing of genocide, but also, [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4845.759999999999s)]
*  you know, Jews and Muslims, they've just been at it for centuries. They've just been doing, [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4853.04s)]
*  this is a Jews and Muslims thing. Not just decades, but hundreds of years. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4857.44s)]
*  It's why when I talk about these situations... That's crazy. I'm sure Mudahar [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4861.76s)]
*  understands the history very well. Yeah. He definitely seems to me like, [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4866.24s)]
*  he knows what the fuck he's talking about. Yeah. No, he knows. He knows. He knows that, [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4871.68s)]
*  he knows that, you know, during the Ottoman administration of the region, Jews and Muslims [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4876.72s)]
*  were at each other's throats. He knows. Certainly. That's not what happened. This is a maximum [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4882.400000000001s)]
*  hundred year, 1920s. Okay. This is the Balfour Declaration thing. Okay. That's it. And the worst [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4888.48s)]
*  aspect of it, the most violent aspect of it has been for 76 years. Yeah. Maybe he, just like Joe [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4896.4s)]
*  Biden, just bought the Rashid Khalidi 100 years of Palestine. ...in a nuanced conflict. I say that, [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4902.879999999999s)]
*  listen. John Stewart said the same thing though. Yeah. He's wrong. Okay. He's wrong. The [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4909.28s)]
*  Ottomans protected us for centuries. Many of us are very grateful. Yeah, I know. It's under the [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4914.16s)]
*  Ottoman Empire. The entire region of the Ottoman Empire was considered a far safer territory for [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4918.32s)]
*  Jews. Jews that escaped the Spanish Inquisition went to the Ottoman Empire. Some of them even [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4926.32s)]
*  went to what is known as Palestine at the time. You were talking about hundreds of years of like, [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4931.84s)]
*  just institutional dislike between each other. If we're going to talk about ancient conflict, [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4937.04s)]
*  it's not Jews versus Muslims. Okay. You mean Israel? Bitch, Israel didn't fucking exist. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4942.16s)]
*  What are you talking about? What is Israel? Sarcasm might be. It's okay. Sorry. Got a little [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4948.0s)]
*  fucking heated there. Like what makes someone who normally just churns out bottom of the barrel, [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4953.44s)]
*  fucking Reddit back slop on, I don't know, Moist Critical said this, or I don't even think he would [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4961.2s)]
*  go out there, Moist Critical, but like a dude who hangs out with fucking Keemstar and like Boogie [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4966.16s)]
*  1477 or 1488. Sorry. Like what leads you? What compels you into thinking that you can [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4971.12s)]
*  even tackle the minutia of this, this complex geopolitical situation that you've said is complex. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4977.36s)]
*  The morality of it is clear. It's not complex at all genocide wrong, but like what the fuck makes [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4984.0s)]
*  you think you could just talk about this shit. And the problem here is this is the reason why [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4989.68s)]
*  he thinks he could talk about this shit. Okay. 1 million fucking views on this. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=4996.56s)]
*  Don't say Wikipedia. He hasn't even opened a fucking Wikipedia page. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=5001.92s)]
*  If you've ever grown up Muslim and I like make a video about how Bloodborne is not 60 FPS, [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=5005.68s)]
*  please make a video about how, you know, it hasn't come. They haven't brought a PC port to [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=5011.52s)]
*  Bloodborne. Like stay in your fucking lane. You know what I mean? It's crazy. Also clean your [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=5017.4400000000005s)]
*  fucking shirt. God damn is so disrespectful. I have, then you know that there is a serious [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=5023.6s)]
*  culture of antisemitism, uh, you know, in amongst the most conservative of Muslim circles, [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=5029.52s)]
*  just as you will know that there is a serious amount of Islamophobia in the most right wing [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=5034.56s)]
*  of Jewish circles. These are two groups of people that literally are just fighting each other and [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=5039.04s)]
*  it's not going to change. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God, brother. Oh my God. Oh my God. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=5044.96s)]
*  This is not about Islamophobia versus antisemitism. Oh my God. Also, it's not just [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=5052.64s)]
*  Jewish people in Israel that exhibit, uh, severe levels of Islamophobia. Okay. And same with [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=5059.04s)]
*  antisemitism. Mind you, it's not fucking just Muslims, conservative Muslims that have a lot of [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=5064.16s)]
*  antisemitism. Have you met a fucking, have you met like a white guy, like a white right winger? [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=5068.72s)]
*  Like what the fuck? Yeah. Have you seen the average US Congress person? They hit both of [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=5075.2s)]
*  those markers of antisemitism and Islamophobia. Until like the youth grow up. Did I say white [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=5079.6s)]
*  winger? I said right white, white right winger. Realize that this kind of hatred towards each [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=5085.280000000001s)]
*  other doesn't really meld well. And when it comes to people dying in a conflict zone like Gaza right [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=5090.56s)]
*  now, there is literally nothing that I feel other than sadness for men, women, and children [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=5096.160000000001s)]
*  needlessly dying for no reason. It's why that, you know, time and time again, I donate as much [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=5101.84s)]
*  as I can to aid, uh, you know, even going, you know, like tens of thousands of dollars [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=5107.04s)]
*  just to make sure that people who need medical assistance, and I vet my charities the best that [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=5111.76s)]
*  I can to assist people in really shitty situations. I don't make it a big deal to talk about it because [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=5116.4s)]
*  I don't think donating money should be constantly promoted, uh, in the sense that, you know, are you [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=5122.16s)]
*  really doing it to help people or- He's a good guy, man. He's a, he's a really good guy. You're [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=5127.28s)]
*  doing it to make yourself look better in the eyes of the world, but it's- No, I'm gonna talk about [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=5131.28s)]
*  it, but I'm also going to talk about how I don't talk about it. The tiniest thing that I can do [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=5135.76s)]
*  in order to- How does it feel to get flexed on like that? Yeah. It fucking destroyed me. I, [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=5140.24s)]
*  I never donate except for today where, uh, you know, every single merchandise that you guys [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=5144.320000000001s)]
*  purchased today from the ideology.shop is all proceeds are going to races, Texas, um, which is [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=5150.72s)]
*  a, a charity that works with, uh, immigrants in Texas, not racist, man. Oh God. Right. He says [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=5156.320000000001s)]
*  100% of the proceeds that ideology.shop is going to race says Texas. What is this? Nah, that's just, [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=5165.84s)]
*  that's just one of many different instances where you've fundraised for, for Palestinians. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=5172.8s)]
*  That's just, you know, to make sure that, you know, maybe somebody who needs medical assistance in a [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=5177.84s)]
*  part of the world where they literally can, you know, literally it is one of the most like sought [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=5182.96s)]
*  after needs can get some attention. And it's one conflict that I hope before I die, things can kind [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=5187.84s)]
*  of change. Now, ultimately I really do think that Twitch is fucking cooked when it comes to this [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=5193.84s)]
*  kind of stuff. Yeah, dude, I think we should ban the fucking guy who was, uh, you know, I love [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=5198.96s)]
*  doing donations, but Twitch should ban the guy who was fundraised to the tune of multiple millions [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=5204.56s)]
*  of dollars for those Palestinians that I definitely do care about because some other dumb ass who was [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=5210.32s)]
*  my friend online who also doesn't give a shit about Israel, Palestine made another fucking drama [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=5216.4800000000005s)]
*  YouTube video. And I agree with him. Yeah, guys, I care about Palestine the right way. You understand? [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=5222.4s)]
*  And if you care about Palestinians the right way, you have to demand that Hassan gets banned because [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=5228.879999999999s)]
*  after all, I care about the inconsistencies in the terms of service of Twitch. That's right. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=5236.4s)]
*  And it's weird. It's weird that they haven't banned him maybe because they have seen, you know, [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRHWngWaE_k&t=5241.36s)]
