# Hasan DESTROYS Trump Supporter In Chat | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [April 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4)
*  Because you think more than 50% of Americans voted for Donald Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=0.0s)]
*  Automatically, you're stupid for that point. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=4.08s)]
*  Because 50 plus percent of Americans did not vote for Donald Trump. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=6.72s)]
*  You're talking about people that did go out and vote. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=10.96s)]
*  That's not 50% of Americans. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=13.52s)]
*  Okay? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=15.68s)]
*  That's number one. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=16.32s)]
*  It's at most 30 to 31% of Americans. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=17.12s)]
*  Now, you're stupid enough to think that that is probably not even 30% of Americans. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=20.64s)]
*  It's probably a little bit lower than that. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=24.96s)]
*  But it doesn't matter. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  Okay? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=27.2s)]
*  Because I do think that... [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=27.84s)]
*  ...extreme is on both sides, am I right? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=34.800000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I'm so f***ing extreme that I want you to have goddamn healthcare. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=36.56s)]
*  And America to stop destroying the f***ing planet. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=39.52s)]
*  What an extreme position. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=42.72s)]
*  It's exactly the same as saying Sandy Hook didn't f***ing happen. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=43.84s)]
*  I'm brilliant, by the way. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=46.72s)]
*  And watch, he's going to turn around and go, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  Huh, did I trigger you? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=50.32s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=51.68000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, wow, so insane to deport a gang member. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=52.64s)]
*  Yes, as well as Iran, Iraq, every other Middle Eastern country. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=55.12s)]
*  Yes, every other Middle Eastern country. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  You guys and your followers are basically the same as Alex Jones, LaMau. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=60.4s)]
*  I voted for Trump and Dem governor in Indianapolis. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=65.12s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=68.4s)]
*  Oh, he's not even a... [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=69.28s)]
*  If you guys stop focusing on identity policy, okay, nevermind. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=71.52s)]
*  He's a Trump supporter. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=73.92s)]
*  He's not... [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=74.72s)]
*  He's just... [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=75.12s)]
*  He's the center right. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=76.88s)]
*  He's not even a liberal. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=78.32s)]
*  Okay, but Alex Jones is literally called what Israel's doing. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=79.92s)]
*  I don't know if I can make my libtard dad wake up and see that Israel's doing it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=82.8s)]
*  That's crazy that he had to hear it from Alex Jones. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=85.67999999999999s)]
*  He also claimed you loved and voted for Jill Stein. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=89.83999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I don't care. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=92.24s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=93.19999999999999s)]
*  If you guys stop focusing on identity policies in Palestine, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=93.83999999999999s)]
*  the left might actually have a chance. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=95.91999999999999s)]
*  Blue collar workers, union folk, and middle class America [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=96.96s)]
*  don't really give a s*** about Palestine. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=98.72s)]
*  No offense to your show, but it's just Palestine, Israel, yap, yap, yap. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=99.91999999999999s)]
*  Nobody, nobody in America really gives a... [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=102.64s)]
*  About that. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=105.52s)]
*  Not trying to be mean, but honest. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=106.32s)]
*  Also, the fashion Nazi bullshit is why Trump got elected. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=107.52s)]
*  Everyone you don't agree with is Hitler. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=109.6s)]
*  That makes the average person steer away. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=111.52s)]
*  Yeah, everyone you don't agree with Hitler, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=113.28s)]
*  would be Adolf Hitler, which is why I... [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=115.6s)]
*  Nobody cares about Israel, Palestine, by the way, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=118.64s)]
*  except for the Adolf Hitler candidate that I voted for, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=120.96s)]
*  that is so up the a**hole of the neo-Nazi government of Israel, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=123.6s)]
*  that he's currently undermining the constitution [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=129.6s)]
*  that you're supposed to love and want to preserve. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  Eroding free speech protections. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=134.96s)]
*  Did you know that? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=136.72s)]
*  Are you aware of anything? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=137.76s)]
*  No, because you're a dumb Trump supporter. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=138.8s)]
*  You called everybody a Nazi, so I wanted to show you [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=140.56s)]
*  by voting for the neo-Nazi that wanted to do mass deportations [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=143.28s)]
*  of 20 million people who started the process [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=146.8s)]
*  by shipping them off to a god damn labor colony in El Salvador [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=149.44s)]
*  and is undermining the Supreme Court of the United States as we speak [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=152.72s)]
*  and actively dismantling due process and the First Amendment. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=156.8s)]
*  Two fundamental aspects of liberalism that are defensible. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=160.16s)]
*  Some of the only defensible positions that liberals have ever come up with, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=165.44s)]
*  and Donald Trump is trying to take that away [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=169.04s)]
*  because he's a fascist piece of s**t, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=170.48s)]
*  and he certainly doesn't give a f**k about you dumb... [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=172.23999999999998s)]
*  because you're stupid enough to hyper-focus on the identity politics of it all. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=173.84s)]
*  Oh, the left got two identity politics focus. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=178.23999999999998s)]
*  That's why I voted for the other side of identity politics. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=180.48s)]
*  What the f**k do you think Trump is doing [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  when he talks about preserving America? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=184.72s)]
*  That's also identity politics, you moron. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=186.64s)]
*  He's just been... he's able to couch it [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=188.72s)]
*  by redirecting the anger and animosity towards people [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=190.88s)]
*  that you've never met that you are terrified of. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=193.76s)]
*  That's it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=195.6s)]
*  All the while you get rug pulled. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=197.04s)]
*  Your future is gone. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=199.12s)]
*  You're never going to retire. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=200.16s)]
*  He's going to melt you so that Mark Zuckerberg can drink you a Soylent one day. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=201.44s)]
*  Okay? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=205.76s)]
*  But hey, guess what? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=206.72s)]
*  You will have owned the libs. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=207.6s)]
*  Yeah, go to Walmart and ask people. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=208.88s)]
*  Never said I agree with that. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=210.07999999999998s)]
*  This is great. I got you to crash out. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=210.79999999999998s)]
*  Yes, dude, you did. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=212.23999999999998s)]
*  By demonstrating how stupid you are, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=213.44s)]
*  you caused me to lose even a little bit more faith [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=216.56s)]
*  that I had in the American population. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=218.95999999999998s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=220.72s)]
*  I'm crashing out because of how dumb you are. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=221.92s)]
*  Because previously I thought someone couldn't be this stupid. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=224.23999999999998s)]
*  And now you've shown me that, as a matter of fact, you are stupid. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  So stupid that I didn't even think that it was fathomable to be this stupid. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=231.04s)]
*  So congratulations. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=234.08s)]

*  Explain to me what my projection is. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=254.08s)]
*  Is Donald Trump not currently nuking global trade because he's bored? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=256.0s)]
*  Is he not molesting your money? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=259.28s)]
*  Is he not ruining your future? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=260.96s)]
*  Are you going to be able to retire at a reasonable age, Chatter? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=262.72s)]
*  Do you have a home? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=265.12s)]

*  Do you think things are getting better? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=268.72s)]
*  No, they're not. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=270.8s)]
*  But you're too afraid to recognize that reality because you thought, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=271.52s)]
*  hey, he threw some red meat your way. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=273.84s)]
*  He said, trans people, they're out of sports. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=275.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=278.48s)]
*  Thank God he eliminated the 40 trans athletes [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=278.96s)]
*  that were participating in collegiate level athletics. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=281.68s)]
*  Thank God. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=284.32s)]
*  Any day now, your rent is coming down, baby. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=285.36s)]
*  Any day now. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=288.32s)]
*  I'm passing through the point I made. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=290.0s)]
*  Is it enough to justify not engaging? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=291.36s)]
*  No, you can't engage with this because you know, I'm right deep down inside. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=293.36s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=296.72s)]
*  And because you have no argument, you just go, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=297.76s)]
*  no, I was just being a cool guy. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=300.32s)]
*  I was just passing through. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=301.84000000000003s)]

*  I love having Trump supporters pass by in here to be like projection. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=311.6s)]
*  Especially right now when we're facing down the barrel of stagflation [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=315.28s)]
*  and potentially another Great Depression, the greatest depression of all time, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=318.88s)]

*  Okay. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=328.32s)]

*  and invade Iran at the behest of Israel. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=334.32s)]

*  Yes. If I'm so stupid, then 50 plus percent of America is stupid. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=395.6s)]
*  First of all, you want to know why you're stupid? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=398.96s)]
*  Because you think more than 50% of Americans voted for Donald Trump. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=403.03999999999996s)]
*  Automatically, you're stupid for that point. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=407.12s)]
*  Because 50 plus percent of Americans did not vote for Donald Trump. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=409.76s)]
*  You're talking about people that did go out and vote. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=413.91999999999996s)]
*  That's not 50% of Americans. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=416.47999999999996s)]
*  That's number one. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=419.28s)]
*  It's at most 30 to 31% of Americans. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=420.15999999999997s)]
*  Now you're stupid enough to think that that is probably not even 30% of Americans. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=423.59999999999997s)]
*  It's probably a little bit lower than that, but it doesn't matter. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=427.92s)]
*  Okay? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=430.16s)]

*  We're all stupid and we're getting collectively dumber, partially as a consequence of capitalism [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=437.68s)]
*  and the erosion of any sort of educational opportunity, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=441.76s)]
*  paywalling higher education to begin with. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=446.48s)]
*  Okay? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=448.88s)]
*  Those are all bad reasons. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=450.16s)]
*  Those are all the reasons why we are dumber than our counterparts elsewhere. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=451.28000000000003s)]
*  Okay? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=456.16s)]
*  Everywhere else. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=456.72s)]
*  Everywhere else, they are more intelligent than we are across the board, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=458.0s)]
*  partially because we don't give a fuck about education. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=461.92s)]
*  We underfund education. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=464.96000000000004s)]
*  We undermine public education, which is still, you know, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=466.64000000000004s)]
*  the most effective way of educating the masses. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=469.44s)]
*  Okay? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=472.0s)]
*  Our literacy rate is 76%. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=472.64000000000004s)]
*  You're like, oh, do you think Americans are... [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=474.72s)]
*  I can't believe you said majority of Americans are stupid. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=477.12s)]
*  Yes, we are. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=479.20000000000005s)]
*  And it's not even our fault. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=480.16s)]
*  It's the fault of the dumb fucks that control this country. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=482.16s)]
*  Whether Republican or Democrat doesn't matter. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=485.68s)]
*  They are all responsible for this. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=488.32s)]
*  And you're over here still sitting in your own fucking filth, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=490.47999999999996s)]
*  thinking we are actually amazing. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=494.08s)]

*  He runs a weed co-op in San Diego. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=498.96s)]
*  Anyway, let me clarify. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=502.08s)]
*  So you think 75 million Americans are stupid? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=503.2s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=505.35999999999996s)]
*  I think the number is much higher than that. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=506.24s)]
*  Duane, do you think I'm going to feel ashamed for saying if you voted for Donald Trump, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=508.64s)]
*  you're stupid? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=512.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=513.76s)]
*  Unless... [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=514.64s)]
*  Look, it's pretty basic. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=515.44s)]
*  It's a very basic premise that I used to repeat all the time. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=517.12s)]
*  And I think Sam Seder brought this up as well on his Jubilee video. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=520.48s)]
*  Unless you are a billionaire or a Christian nationalist [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=524.96s)]
*  or a white supremacist of sorts, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=529.36s)]
*  Donald Trump is not giving you anything. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=532.1600000000001s)]
*  So yes, if you voted for Donald Trump [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=535.12s)]
*  and you're not a part of these three categories, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=537.0400000000001s)]
*  you are stupid. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=539.2800000000001s)]
*  Because at least those three people, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=540.6400000000001s)]
*  those three subgroups, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=542.4000000000001s)]
*  they're getting something out of this process. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=543.92s)]
*  You aren't. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=546.0799999999999s)]
*  The reality of the matter is those three subgroups [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=547.92s)]
*  are going to get fucked over in the long run as well. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=551.4399999999999s)]
*  But at least in the interim, they're getting something. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=553.76s)]
*  You know, you're not. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=556.0799999999999s)]
*  You're getting nothing. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=558.4799999999999s)]
*  So yes, if you're not a part of those three groups that I brought forward, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=559.4399999999999s)]
*  then yeah, you voted against your best interest. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=562.9599999999999s)]
*  Not to say that the Democrats would be great for you either. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=566.16s)]
*  They're fucking awful too. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=568.9599999999999s)]
*  But at least they're not as awful as the Republicans are on some issues. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=570.64s)]
*  On others, they are just as awful. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=575.76s)]
*  Let's be fucking real. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=577.68s)]
*  Like the continuation of genocide in Gaza. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=578.72s)]
*  Which, by the way, regardless of whether or not you're an American [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=581.04s)]
*  and think that, oh, that's just happening over there, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=584.96s)]
*  your tax dollars are still funding and facilitating that. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=587.28s)]
*  Every single fucking bomb that you and I are paying for with our tax dollars [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=590.56s)]
*  could have been spent on a brick that goes to build a school. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=596.08s)]
*  It could have been spent on roads to pave. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=599.84s)]
*  It could have been spent on hardening and bettering our infrastructure across the board. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=602.96s)]
*  So when you sit around in this fucking filth of late-stage capitalist dystopia [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=607.76s)]
*  in the United States of America, remember, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=612.48s)]
*  it's because we're constantly doing bad shit over there. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=614.64s)]
*  You can just say, it doesn't matter. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=618.1600000000001s)]
*  Oh my God, we have to keep being a dominant military. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=620.32s)]
*  We have to do that. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=623.76s)]
*  We have to dominate the whole fucking planet. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=624.48s)]
*  What good is all of that imperialism? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=626.88s)]
*  If the bounty doesn't even return to you, it does not. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=629.44s)]
*  You don't even get the, you don't even get a fucking fraction of the crumbs [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=633.12s)]
*  of all the bloodshed that you cause around, that we all are responsible for around the planet. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=636.32s)]
*  And you sit there in your own fucking filth and you go, nah, we're still number one, baby. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=642.32s)]
*  We're not number two. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=647.6800000000001s)]
*  We're not even number 10. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=648.8800000000001s)]
*  We're number one at the highest rate of obesity with the exception. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=650.08s)]
*  I think like other countries are beating us on that front now because God forbid. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=653.84s)]
*  I mean, we've exported a whole bunch of our awful fucking food over there too. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=657.84s)]
*  We're number, we used to be number one in the highest prisoner rate per capita. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=662.32s)]
*  Now El Salvador, our concentration camp country is beating us on that front. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=666.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=673.0400000000001s)]
*  We are such a poisonous parasitic force on the fucking planet [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=674.72s)]

*  No. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=711.76s)]
*  And it's not because of fucking trans people and Guatemalans. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=712.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=716.24s)]
*  Ironically enough, the only reason why it is because of trans people in Guatemala is [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=716.88s)]
*  because your dumb fuck ass thinks that politicians that say it's because of trans people in [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=720.8s)]
*  Guatemalans are the right politicians that you should vote for who then lie to you about that [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=725.68s)]

*  My point is I think you could have a real movement if you didn't preach identity politics [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=741.52s)]

*  Dumbass. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=787.92s)]
*  You are letting these fucking demons rob you blind because you get excited at the thought [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=788.8000000000001s)]
*  of dominating a group of people that never did anything wrong to you. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=795.44s)]

*  highlight it? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=812.96s)]
*  No, I think that we're just getting dumber and dumber every day that passes by. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=814.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, that's what I think. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=819.0400000000001s)]
*  Anyway, it seems like you are susceptible to change though, but that comes from within. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=823.76s)]
*  So you're going to have to reconsider your positions. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=830.24s)]
*  Trump has actually been anti-war. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=833.2800000000001s)]
*  Oh my God, dude, buddy. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=834.96s)]
*  You are really not doing a good job defending the notion that like Trump supporters are [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=838.64s)]
*  actually smart. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=843.76s)]
*  How is Trump in anti-war, man? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=845.2800000000001s)]
*  What the fuck are you talking about? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=847.12s)]
*  He literally said we did. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=848.88s)]
*  We need to ethnically cleanse Gaza. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=850.1600000000001s)]
*  He said that the only solution out of this is to literally do forcible ethnic displacement [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=852.0s)]
*  in the Gaza Strip, which is again, Nazi shit. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=858.0s)]
*  Okay, that is just straightforwardly Nazi shit. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=861.12s)]
*  Donald Trump has also talked about fucking forcibly annexing Greenland, forcibly annexing [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=863.92s)]
*  Canada, forcibly annexing the Panama Canal, bombing Yemen, even though every other goddamn [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=869.84s)]
*  president has done that too, but bombing Yemen somehow harder than the previous administration. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=875.2s)]
*  And why is he bombing Yemen, by the way? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=880.16s)]
*  Because Yemen wants to punish Israel financially by implementing a blockade on the Red Sea [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=882.24s)]
*  because Israel is doing a genocide in Gaza also with our money, with our bombs again. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=891.4399999999999s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=897.68s)]
*  So instead of telling Israel to cut it the fuck out, what you could do with one goddamn [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=899.1999999999999s)]
*  phone call, he's so fucking cucked because he's got a hundred million dollars from [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=902.88s)]
*  Miriam Adelson that he's going, you know what, another $16 billion to Israel, and also let's [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=907.92s)]
*  spend another $10 billion bombing the poorest country on the planet, Yemen. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=914.9599999999999s)]
*  Do you feel like this is a good idea? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=920.0s)]
*  Now you got journalists and think tank writers fantasizing about the prospect of doing a [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=922.0s)]
*  military ground invasion in Yemen. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=928.0799999999999s)]
*  We can't stop the Yemeni population by bombing them into oblivion and destroying their ports [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=930.0s)]
*  as we did last night. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=935.52s)]
*  So what we must do instead is maybe send troops there so we can send another fucking faction of [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=938.0s)]
*  cornbread, Iowan men and women to go and fucking get their dicks and asses blown off by IEDs [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=944.8s)]
*  for no reason other than the fact that we just couldn't tell Israel to stop doing a genocide. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=953.12s)]
*  Do you feel like that's a good future for you? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=957.92s)]
*  Do you feel like we're living in a better world in the post 9-11 universe after [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=960.24s)]
*  20 plus years of fucking doing war on terror that was $7 trillion at cost? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=965.12s)]
*  Tens of millions of people displaced from their homes, more terror cells propping up left and [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=972.4s)]
*  right in the ashes that we leave every fucking region. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=977.92s)]
*  Do you feel like this was good? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=982.48s)]
*  Do you feel like this was successful? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=984.08s)]
*  Do you feel like we achieved anything? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=986.8s)]
*  Well, we did. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=988.24s)]
*  It's just you didn't and I didn't achieve anything, but Halliburton [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=990.32s)]
*  surely made a fuck ton of money. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=993.92s)]
*  Defense contractors made a fuck ton of money. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=995.92s)]
*  It was great. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=998.0s)]
*  Wars are not meant to be won after all. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=998.8s)]
*  It's about continuing the military domination so that you can constantly recycle new weapons, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=1000.64s)]
*  spend more money on R&D. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=1005.8399999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump is anti-war, he says. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=1007.5999999999999s)]
*  Okay, he is more anti-war than any Democrat in my lifetime as a fact. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=1011.4399999999999s)]
*  No, he has not. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=1014.16s)]
*  No, he is not more anti-war than any Democrat in your lifetime. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=1016.4s)]
*  If Joe Biden hadn't done, hadn't continued the fucking genocide in Israel as Donald Trump [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=1019.04s)]
*  is also continuing, by the way, and vociferously defending, Joe Biden would have been literally [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=1023.52s)]
*  less of a warmonger than Donald Trump and any other fucking president. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=1029.12s)]
*  He pulled out of Afghanistan. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=1033.76s)]
*  He demonstrated the moral courage to do that. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=1035.12s)]
*  We, of course, forgot about it because the last year of his dumbass gerontocracy [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=1038.32s)]
*  was spent mutilating and murdering children in Gaza. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=1044.8799999999999s)]
*  So Obama, Biden, and so on didn't continue military lead domination in the military [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=1048.72s)]
*  industry. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=1053.28s)]
*  No, they did. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=1053.84s)]
*  But your metric is wrong is what I'm saying. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=1055.2s)]
*  These are all warmongering assholes. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=1059.12s)]
*  They're monsters. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=1061.76s)]
*  They are all war criminals. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=1063.28s)]
*  That is true. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=1064.72s)]
*  I agree with that. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=1065.44s)]
*  Obama, Biden, and Donald Trump. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=1066.32s)]
*  But if you are saying that Donald Trump is better, that Donald Trump is better overall [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=1068.6399999999999s)]
*  than fucking Biden, for example, without the last year of the Biden administration, you're wrong. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=1074.72s)]
*  And considering that Israel is still continuing his genocide under the Trump administration, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=1082.8s)]
*  as it did under the Biden administration, that's not even a part of the conversation [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=1087.04s)]
*  at this point. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=1091.44s)]
*  What you mean to say is that Donald Trump, at the very least, lied about being anti-war. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=1092.16s)]
*  The Democrats didn't. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=1099.6s)]
*  All right. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=1100.96s)]
*  You look tired. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBFJTcPxa4&t=1101.52s)]
