# The Contrast In Medical Research Between China And The U.S. | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c)
*  Do you know what's really funny about this? The very same analysts here in America want [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=0.0s)]
*  to remove FDA restrictions from the trial process because it's too costly while simultaneously [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=4.8s)]
*  they're like, and the Chinese trial setup, and I'm not familiar with what their processes. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=11.68s)]
*  A new Chinese cancer drug is making way of showing nearly double the effectiveness of [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=22.72s)]
*  130 billion blockbuster K-truda in clinical trials. Some call it a game changer, just [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=26.68s)]
*  like deep seeking AI, but in China, skepticism runs deep. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=30.68s)]
*  Chinese scientists celebrating a breakthrough, one that may have just outperformed a top [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=37.6s)]
*  U.S. cancer drug. A case barely known a year ago is now shaking up the biotech world. Their [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=42.64s)]
*  new cancer drug, even S MAP, they're first to get major international attention. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=52.12s)]
*  You know, we got to, we got to think about the negatives on this. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=56.96s)]
*  And head to head with K-truda, one of Merck's biggest sellers, more than 130 billion dollars [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  so far. Clinical trials in China show it kept lung tumors from growing for nearly twice [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=68.16s)]
*  as long, sending the stock of a case shows U.S. partner soaring. Some call it a game [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=74.44s)]
*  changer, just like Chinese startup DeepSeek shook up AI. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=79.96s)]
*  China's innovation push goes beyond biotech from AI to robotics to medicine. China is [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=84.55999999999999s)]
*  racing ahead. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=90.55999999999999s)]
*  I don't think it will be a threat because, you know, innovation science is the global [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  thing. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=98.6s)]
*  A case, so CEO Michelle Xia telling reporters in San Francisco. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=99.6s)]
*  She's saying it's not a threat to find a cure for cancer is not a threat. It will advance [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=105.16s)]
*  every like it will advance our collective growth. It will make everybody's lives better. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=109.2s)]
*  China's biotech industry is going global. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=115.4s)]
*  We participate more and more to this ecosystem. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=118.52000000000001s)]
*  I'm telling you right now, we already allocated a shit ton of money specifically to like anti-China [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=122.04s)]
*  initiatives. I suspect that we'll be doing to ourselves what we did to the Philippines [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=127.80000000000001s)]
*  in terms of like vaccine hesitancy campaigns, where if China actually has a successful cancer [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  curing drug, I, you know, get excited for the anti-vaxxers in the United States of America [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=138.23999999999998s)]
*  to be like, no, this is actually going to make you gay. And we're very happy that Donald [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=143.76s)]
*  Trump made this drug illegal. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=150.76s)]
*  But in China, skepticism is everywhere, especially online. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=152.35999999999999s)]
*  On the streets of Beijing. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=159.44s)]
*  No, I've never heard of it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=160.44s)]
*  Several people told us they've never heard of the company or its drug. This man says [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=163.2s)]
*  he still trusts pricier foreign drugs more. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=167.84s)]
*  I was joking when I said that, but I'm glad that we're already doing it. Amazing. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=172.56s)]
*  To be honest, I tend to choose the more expensive medicine. After all, you get what you pay [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=177.12s)]
*  for. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=182.12s)]
*  They may have good reason to be wary. A public hospital scandal over questionable drug quality [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=183.12s)]
*  triggered a government probe last month. China's health regulator defended the drug safety, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=189.52s)]
*  saying the investigation found the quality concerns to be unsubstantiated. But some say [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  they're oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=200.20000000000002s)]
*  They're not convinced. Is there any reason not to trust China clinical trials? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=205.88s)]
*  Yeah. So there's been a lot of scrutiny in the past. The FDA has made rejections because [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=211.48000000000002s)]
*  there's been the trial setup is not. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=217.88s)]
*  Despite the doubts, China's, do you know what's really funny about this? The very same analysts [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=220.84s)]
*  here in America want to remove FDA restrictions from the trial process because it's too costly [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=226.08s)]
*  while simultaneously they're like, and the Chinese trial setup, and I'm not familiar [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=233.0s)]
*  with what their processes. Okay. I'm not an expert, but it is pretty funny when they're [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=237.28s)]
*  like, Hey, this life-saving cancer, like this life-saving miracle cure is out, but also [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=242.92000000000002s)]
*  it's Chinese and therefore you probably shouldn't trust it. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=249.28s)]
*  Biotech boom is undeniable. Investors are pumping billions into research. And while not [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=254.28s)]
*  all clinical trials are peer reviewed, China's low cost, high speed trials are getting noticed. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=260.68s)]
*  How should patients feel watching this? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=267.88s)]
*  I think it's good news for patients worldwide. Where you're waiting for a life-saving drug, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=270.28s)]
*  you don't really mind where it originates. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=275.0s)]
*  The U.S. still leads biotech for now, but a case shows drug is proof China is closing [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=278.12s)]
*  in fast. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=285.04s)]
*  The U.S. House passed the Bio Secure Act that's supposed to limit business with Chinese firms. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=288.76s)]
*  Beijing fired back accusing the U.S. of ideological bias, calling for quote here, a fair, just [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=294.36s)]
*  and non-discriminatory business environment. So Rihanna, as you know, China's biotech rise, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=302.44s)]
*  this is not just about medicine. It's also political. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=306.76s)]
*  Very interesting, very interesting story indeed. Will Ripley, thank you so much for this. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=310.92s)]
*  We have a real bad, we have a real bad track record with this. Like we did this with Cuba [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=315.4s)]
*  too. This is crazy. Like I don't even understand why they went to like, I mean, I don't know [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=320.76s)]
*  who the senior analyst is. Like, why didn't they talk to like a medical researcher? Is [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=327.0s)]
*  this person a medical researcher? Oh God, I hate this so much. I hate it because like, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=332.15999999999997s)]
*  this is, this is precisely what I mean. I mean, this is the vice president. She's a [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=338.84s)]
*  senior analyst at Bernstein, ex McKinsey, Harvard PhD, equity research and analyst looking [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=344.08s)]
*  at Chinese pharma and biotech. What's oh my God. Kai just farted so bad. Holy shit. Oh, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=349.68s)]
*  don't wag your tail. Nasty ass. Jesus Christ. This is great. I want more of it. Cautiously [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=357.15999999999997s)]
*  optimistic though. Doubling time before tumor growth and recurrence is amazing, but it's [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=362.88s)]
*  not the same as a cure. The parent company, maybe Bernstein is two insurance companies. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=366.91999999999996s)]
*  The thing that doesn't make sense to me about this is on the one hand, we're like, Oh dude, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=374.15999999999997s)]
*  watch out. China's doing medical research. We should be wary of it. On the other hand, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=379.67999999999995s)]
*  we're literally removing a font, like a massive part of the way NIH grants are given to colleges [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=386.76s)]
*  where public research is conducted. Okay. Taya, where are you going? Taya, come here. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=395.08s)]
*  No, what that? Okay. What, what, what is happening? Okay. She's out of control. Literally out [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=404.28s)]
*  of control. This is insane. This is the most, this is the most insane she's been. Okay. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=413.35999999999996s)]
*  Why are you wagging your tail? Why are you wagging your tail? She's like, no, it's my [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=419.88s)]
*  time to shine. I want to stream. You want to go outside? Okay. Hold on. Get down. Down. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=425.11999999999995s)]
*  Down. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=430.11999999999995s)]
*  She just darted out. Did she get even bigger? Yes. I think she's still growing. Yeah. As [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=473.28s)]
*  I was saying on the one hand, we are complaining about China innovating in the field of, of [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=482.91999999999996s)]
*  pharmaceuticals. On the other hand, we're actively undermining any kind of research [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=488.64s)]
*  that we might do in the field of novel chemical compound discovery. So it just doesn't make [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=493.84s)]
*  sense at all. Hi, great stuff. Check the ratio. The maggots are pissed about JFK files. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=500.32s)]
*  What is this? My GOP oversight task force first hearing will be held on March 26th. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=507.32s)]
*  We'll examine the assassination of JFK. We will also visit the site of the assassination. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=511.52s)]
*  One Ms. Luna is burning through all of a lot of goodwill with this endless tick tock routine. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=515.92s)]
*  Whoever told her this was great for brand building and engagement is dead wrong. It's [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=521.04s)]
*  massive and net negative. Such a waste of taxpayer dollars. Just released the files [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=523.92s)]
*  Also, you said you're going to start gaming earlier. So you aren't so dead from so much [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=530.28s)]
*  politics. Give yourself a break King. Leisure called you out. Who? Leisure Miller about what? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=534.28s)]
*  Anyway, where were we? Oh, this is funny. Dan Crenshaw had a hot mic moment. Have you ever met [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=539.48s)]
*  Have you ever met? What the fuck? Why does he hate him? Why does he hate him? That's weird. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=551.56s)]
*  No one answered my leisure question, but regardless. Oh, maybe Russia. Yeah. We just [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=558.92s)]
*  called you out for calling her a lib. I said, I don't think she's a lib. I, it was my chat that [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=566.36s)]
*  was saying she was a lib. I was saying that I think she's like more liberal than me, but still [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=571.4799999999999s)]
*  very much like on our side. She's definitely more liberal adjacent to myself. I still like her [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=576.76s)]
*  content a lot. Anyway, I mean, if she gets mad at being called a lib, that's a good thing. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=584.52s)]
*  That implies that she's not one, you know. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N277ZlpMC0c&t=589.24s)]
