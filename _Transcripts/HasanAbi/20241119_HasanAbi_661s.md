# Dan Saltman Is Still Crying | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [November 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ)
*  That's true. Every part of what I just said is true. 100% of it. And it makes Hasan sound like a f***ing p***er and an asshole. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=0.0s)]
*  And it's true. I have no issue saying that. All the people saying things like, um... [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=9.52s)]
*  Kid, I'm the p***er. You're gonna, you're gonna be able to go a long way with this narrative, you know? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=15.44s)]
*  And it's funny because even his own community was like, correcting him. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=20.56s)]
*  What? They literally admit to making it up? What is this? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=25.28s)]
*  So, I'm gonna give an example of something that, um... [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=28.48s)]
*  I'm gonna give an example of something that I received a lot from you guys. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=33.28s)]
*  What is this? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=37.76s)]
*  Okay? Uh, I think that it's good to say that Hasan had sex with a b***y to at a b***y that was later investigated by authorities for human trafficking. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=38.56s)]
*  That was later investigated by authorities for human trafficking in a scheme that was called brutal. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  I think that's good to include that statement. Okay? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=57.36s)]
*  You guys are like, no, I don't think you should do that. That's not fake news. Okay? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=60.72s)]
*  See, that's where you spot the people that don't know how to make f***ing moves happen. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=65.68s)]
*  It's not fake news. Nothing I said there was untrue. Everything I said there is 100% true. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=70.56s)]
*  I'll say it again. Hasan had sex with... [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=75.6s)]
*  He is trying to massage it in a way where he can imply inappropriate things that he knows are not true without getting legal scrutiny for intent to defame. Okay? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=79.52s)]
*  With a b***y at a b***y that was later investigated, or sorry, raided by the authorities for human trafficking in what was called a brutal system of oppression. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=99.28s)]
*  That's true. Every part of what I just said is true. 100% of it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=110.64s)]
*  And it makes Hasan sound like a f***ing b***y and an a**hole. And it's true. I have no issue saying that. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  All the people saying things like, um... [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=124.0s)]
*  Yeah, dog, I'm the b***y. You're gonna be able to go a long way with this narrative, you know? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=126.08s)]
*  And it's funny because even his own community was correcting him. I saw people in his own Reddit, it was on my subreddit, being like, hey, wasn't the b***y raided for tax evasion? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=131.44s)]
*  And then they were able to successfully sue the Berlin government for defamation. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  And someone immediately goes, it doesn't matter. Just keep saying it anyway. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=152.32s)]
*  Well, you guys are all the reasons that, uh, anyone who doesn't agree, I think, is the reason we have any... [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=159.68s)]
*  Yeah, Berlin pays b***y. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=163.76s)]
*  ...the Supreme Court. You guys are all p***ies. You don't have what it takes to f***ing move the needle. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=165.6s)]
*  Because it's like, oh, oh, well, where's the context? Wait, wait a second. Well, they did rate it for human trafficking, but it was only one instance. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=172.24s)]
*  And later in court, they proved that it wasn't that case. I don't care. I don't care. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=180.08s)]
*  You f***ed up a place that was later rated for human trafficking. That's on you, dog. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=184.8s)]
*  I didn't f*** up a place that was rated for human trafficking. That was you. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=188.64000000000001s)]
*  Like, he knows, he knows that it's legal, he knows that it was raided, and then they successfully sued the government. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=192.32s)]
*  This is from 2023. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  I went to Artemis in 2010. I'm very openly pro s*** work. The conversation that took place was literally about me being pro s*** work. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=202.88s)]
*  I also dated a porn star openly. For those of you who don't know, welcome. Okay? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=211.04s)]
*  I have a lot of friends in the s*** work industry. And not only that, but also the b***hole that I went to in 2010 was rated in 2016, six years after. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=217.12s)]
*  I was 18 when I went. 2016 is when the b***hole was raided. Okay? And not only that, but also [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=229.28s)]
*  they were rated for tax evasion and they successfully sued the state for slandering them. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=241.04000000000002s)]
*  So the fact that Dan will try to still package this as a story, when it's a very clear non-issue, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=247.12s)]
*  specifically to try to get a lot of these s*** s*** work s*** bored to be like, yeah, he's a f***ing piece of s*** is ridiculous. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=254.23999999999998s)]
*  You know? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=262.56s)]
*  Hundreds of police raided the Artemis sauna in West Cloys in 2016, detaining several people on suspicion of human trafficking, tax evasion, and other violations. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=284.15999999999997s)]
*  Crimes like these can be common in the German sex industry, which in and of itself is not illegal. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=292.64s)]
*  At a press conference afterwards, public prosecutors made references to organized crime, but the accusations could not be proven. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=296.24s)]
*  And the Berlin Regional Court would not admit the prosecution's case in 2018. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=300.56s)]
*  Two operators of the b***hole then took the city to the court for wrongful detention before reaching a settlement with the administration. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=304.64s)]
*  The state of Berlin apologizes for the pre-trial detention and considerable disadvantages suffered by those accused at the same time as a result of the search, the pre-trial detention, and the indictment and statements made by public prosecutors' offices. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=309.68s)]
*  The city's judicial administration said in a statement on Friday. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=320.88s)]
*  Also, it's f***ing ridiculous because they're trying to say that I'm doing human trafficking. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=323.44s)]
*  Okay? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=330.08s)]
*  That's what is so f***ing insane. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=330.64s)]
*  It's additionally funny coming from a guy who apparently has direct involvement, financial involvement, with Diddy, Sean P. Diddy Combs. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=333.92s)]
*  So you can say he founded a site that was popular where child groomers had passed through his company's servers. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=343.36s)]
*  Nothing in that sentence was untrue either. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=347.84s)]
*  It's a fact that he owned a site that is infamous for child grooming and funded by P. Diddy. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=349.44s)]
*  Context doesn't matter, right? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=354.08s)]
*  Yeah, like he has a more direct involvement with Sean P. Diddy Combs, who is now in prison, okay, for a website that he created that apparently, apparently was already like under scrutiny due to f***ing actively using that f***ing website. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=355.91999999999996s)]
*  I didn't even know this website existed. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=376.0s)]
*  Okay? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=377.67999999999995s)]
*  Like what an insane set of circumstances. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=378.23999999999995s)]
*  Like I didn't even know this. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=381.35999999999996s)]
*  But it's wild that this person had the audacity to knowingly try to massage the truth in a way that is in a way that is slanderous, but trying to avoid any sort of legal scrutiny with the intent to defame, right? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=384.0s)]
*  When in fact, this mother f***er was, you know, f***er started Tiny Chat. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=400.47999999999996s)]
*  Tiny Chat has been referenced in like FBI investigations, apparently. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=405.84s)]
*  I didn't even know that. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=408.96s)]
*  Or is this it? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=409.84s)]
*  According to court documents from approximately 2014 to 2016, Muhammad Luckman Rana, 33 of Vauganough, Ontario, used online messaging sites as Omegle and Tiny Chat to target both adult and minor victims living in the United States and Canada to produce sexually explicit images. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=411.44s)]
*  That's his website. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=424.48s)]
*  You made that website. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=425.76s)]
*  You got $1.5 million from Diddy and Ashton Kutcher to build this website that like convicted pedophiles have used to literally f***ing trick minors, dude. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=427.76s)]
*  US victims ranging from 12 to 17 into producing sexually explicit images for posting for by posing as a minor male. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=440.71999999999997s)]
*  Why the f*** are you talking about? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=448.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=450.56s)]
*  That's a crazy thing. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=451.76s)]
*  Big surprise. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=453.2s)]
*  This info is nowhere to be seen on LSA. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=453.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=455.84s)]
*  I mean, LSA is run by a Destiny fan. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=456.32s)]
*  That is 100% correct. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=459.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=461.52s)]
*  Multiple, multiple of the moderators on LSA have are Destiny fans. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=462.15999999999997s)]
*  But the main mod, the head mod of LSA is like a Destiny orbiter who was applied for a DGG of the year. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=467.52000000000004s)]
*  That's crazy, man. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=475.52000000000004s)]
*  Fix your f***ing damn life. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=476.8s)]
*  You're 50 years old. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=478.24s)]
*  You're like spending every goddamn day on this conquest that has seemingly been unsuccessful. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=479.44000000000005s)]
*  Dude said he's going to sue you for what? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=487.04s)]
*  For what? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=489.04s)]
*  Like, I'm not even implying he's a pedophile. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=489.92s)]
*  I'm not saying that at all. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=493.36s)]
*  I'm saying that he has a direct involvement. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=494.96s)]
*  The f***. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=497.44s)]
*  You're going to sue me for using the justice.gov website. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=498.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm sure he wants to go through discovery in regards to his tiny chat website. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=502.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=505.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=505.76s)]
*  He was, he was literally running ads. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=506.08s)]
*  What was happening here that we got an ad. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=509.6s)]
*  He, he was literally trying to make it seem like ads are running on my page still because [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=511.68s)]
*  another content creator was running ads is so desperate. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=518.32s)]
*  Also, doesn't this directly contradict the adpocalypse narrative that there are ads [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=522.48s)]
*  still running on the website? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=526.5600000000001s)]
*  Like that's weird. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=529.2s)]
*  How did we get an ad on Hassan's page? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=530.72s)]
*  Oh, it's because Hassan was hosting someone, but I was still on this page [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=533.36s)]
*  and the ad plays right here. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=537.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=539.12s)]
*  This is a legitimate thing that happened. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=539.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=542.24s)]
*  They were, Hassan was hosting someone. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=542.88s)]
*  Thank you for hosting someone, Hassan. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=544.88s)]
*  This is, we were actually, which doesn't even have the capacity to host, by the way. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=547.12s)]
*  It just says a suggested channel. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=551.28s)]
*  Twitch no longer has offline hosting as a feature. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=553.52s)]
*  It's just a suggested channel. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=556.16s)]
*  We're still on this URL right here. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_bSru7-jQ&t=558.0s)]
