# Marcellus Williams: Sentenced Despite Innocence | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [September 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0)
*  No, Biden cannot stop this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=0.0s)]
*  He could call for a, uh, he could call the governor and tell him to stop this. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3.42s)]
*  He could use the bully pulpit, but he cannot directly legally stop this. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=7.88s)]
*  This is a state level. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=12.34s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=14.08s)]
*  In the United States of America, the president can pardon only at the federal level. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=14.84s)]
*  Right now you're looking at an innocent man. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=25.52s)]
*  He, uh, he apparently also, uh, likened Benjamin Netanyahu to, uh, he apparently [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=27.64s)]
*  like him Benjamin Netanyahu and said that if the West had any decency or any [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=35.44s)]
*  consistency, that they would be, they would be dealing with Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  Like they dealt with bro. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=46.56s)]
*  Why do you spread this left lean fake news about what? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=47.96s)]
*  Oh, come on, come on, come on. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=52.0s)]
*  We got, we got to wait till this guy gives us more takes, you know, there's [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=53.04s)]
*  a lot of new accounts by the way, or a lot of accounts that have just started [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=57.48s)]
*  following today, noticeably more charpers. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=60.919999999999995s)]
*  We, but we banned him too quickly. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=63.54s)]
*  Is that because of the CNN thing? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=65.17999999999999s)]
*  No, nah. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=66.64s)]
*  I mean, it's partially because of it. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=68.32s)]
*  I have a lot of, uh, I have a lot of very, very motivated hate watchers that, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=69.96s)]
*  um, see, like see me getting positive coverage and immediately need field a [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=77.0s)]
*  need to like retaliate with counter propaganda to be like, no, no, no, he's [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=82.84s)]
*  bad actually, please. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=86.22s)]
*  Anyway, so today we're going to talk about, I mean, I don't know who Corey [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=87.48s)]
*  pop is, but apparently this was a solid video on Marcellus Williams. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=91.4s)]
*  We can use this as a, to cover the story. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=95.82000000000001s)]
*  Let's take a look at [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=98.36s)]
*  Lee awaiting seven years ago. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=99.12s)]
*  The DNA on the weapon was finally tested and proved it was not his. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=100.52000000000001s)]
*  Whoever handled this knife left DNA. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=104.2s)]
*  It is not Marcellus Williams. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=107.44s)]
*  His was stayed by the then governor and the panel was convened to [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=109.36s)]
*  reassess his conviction. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=111.96000000000001s)]
*  Today. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=113.28s)]
*  A panel will work to decide if that evidence proves Williams is innocent. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=113.72s)]
*  So why is he still here? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=119.2s)]
*  How innocent do you have to be to avoid being? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=121.88s)]
*  This is a justice is wrong. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=124.72s)]
*  The evidence shows my dad's innocent. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=126.6s)]
*  The closer you get to the stranger things get. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=128.6s)]
*  This interview remains the only one Marcellus has been able to [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=132.38s)]
*  give on camera from death row. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=134.96s)]
*  Right now, as you see, I'm sitting in prison on death row. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=136.96s)]
*  My friend Noah did it six years ago while working on a documentary [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=141.36s)]
*  about Marcellus' son's boxing career. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=144.32s)]
*  He's aspiring to be the champion. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=146.6s)]
*  I believe he feels that given the chance he will be the heavyweight champ. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=148.96s)]
*  I'm his only child. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=155.24s)]
*  His son, I'm a professional fighter, but I've been fighting [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=157.12s)]
*  my whole life outside the ring. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=161.0s)]
*  Because of the fighting outside the ring, his boxing career was cut short. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=162.8s)]
*  And as such, so was Noah's documentary. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=166.36s)]
*  Fast forward six years later, Marcellus is still in death row. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=168.8s)]
*  Noah comes to me with the work he's done so we can make this piece [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=172.08s)]
*  that you're watching right now. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=174.92000000000002s)]
*  Noah gave me a rundown of what he was able to capture over the time [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=176.36s)]
*  he was working on this documentary. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=179.48s)]
*  Sat down with him for a few hours and just talked. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=181.4s)]
*  And from there, just started diving in. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=183.72s)]
*  And then I flew to Missouri to follow up and to figure out what has been [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  happening since he sat down with Marcellus. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=189.56s)]
*  It's an- [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=192.0s)]
*  How can this happen with so much evidence? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=192.32s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=194.24s)]
*  This is, this is America. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=194.72s)]
*  All of the- [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=196.24s)]
*  That we contribute to globally, we also do to ourselves on a regular basis. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=196.8s)]
*  He's a black man in Missouri. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=202.44000000000003s)]
*  That's it. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=204.04000000000002s)]
*  What's the mother Jones journalist's name that, that I've covered here before. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=204.60000000000002s)]
*  I met him at, no, not cat. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=209.32000000000002s)]
*  No. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=212.08s)]
*  Um, the dude, the black dude, Garrison? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Garrison Hayes. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=216.68s)]
*  So Garrison Hayes had a really good TikTok on not Marcellus Williams, but hold on here. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=218.4s)]
*  I'm going to, I'm going to pull up something that I thought was very [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=225.76s)]
*  black Americans and informative. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=230.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=232.2s)]
*  And I'm just going to let Garrison Hayes explain this to you. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=233.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=236.44s)]
*  Now, before we get to Marcellus Williams, okay. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=237.04s)]
*  What we need to talk about is the way that black people are treated in the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=241.2s)]
*  justice system and the way that that treatment is defended by pieces of with, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=244.84s)]
*  um, cherry pick data points and also a false presentation of reality. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=250.84s)]
*  Charlie Kirk applies one of the classic examples of this in this Jubilee video. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=255.8s)]
*  I didn't even see this part. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=260.8s)]
*  I don't think. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=262.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=263.68s)]
*  I don't even, I don't even remember this part, but, um, I just wanted to, like I [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=264.28s)]
*  said, hell, uh, give voice to Garrison Hayes in this circumstance because he did [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=269.4s)]
*  a pretty, uh, decent job, uh, going through some of these white supremacist talking [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=274.36s)]
*  points and what the actual reality is. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=279.52s)]
*  And the actual reality of the matter within white supremacy in the justice [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=282.08s)]
*  system is actually perfectly demonstrated by, um, the, the current unjustifiable [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=285.4s)]
*  of an innocent man in the state of Missouri that, that we are, you know, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=291.64s)]
*  we're about to experience in the next couple of hours. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=294.52s)]
*  It's about 13 to 14% of the population. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=297.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=299.15999999999997s)]
*  About half of all prisoners are black. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=299.4s)]
*  So blacks commit more than whites do. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=301.08s)]
*  They commit more, they commit more arsons. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=303.15999999999997s)]
*  They commit more kidnappings. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=304.72s)]
*  For example, blacks are 13% of the population and they commit 58% of all the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=306.15999999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=310.04s)]
*  Let's talk about it. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=311.08s)]
*  These are obviously claims, but I will respond to them as if Charlie Kirk [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=311.96s)]
*  were a reasonable person. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=316.0s)]
*  Black Americans, about 13 to 14% of the population, but half of all prisoners [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=317.32s)]
*  are black. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=320.84s)]
*  Wrong. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=321.24s)]
*  Just 38% of America's prison population is black. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=321.76s)]
*  That's according to the U S government. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=324.8s)]
*  But it makes you wonder why Charlie feels the need to add an additional [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=326.4s)]
*  12% to the black prison population. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=329.44s)]
*  Could it be because his bigoted talking points only work if he exaggerates? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=331.68s)]
*  If Charlie were actually looking for the race that makes up half the prison [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=335.96s)]
*  population in the U S he'd look no further than white people at 57%. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=338.72s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=343.64s)]
*  So blacks commit more than whites do. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=343.84000000000003s)]
*  Wrong. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=345.48s)]
*  The word so is doing a lot of heavy lifting in that sentence. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=345.88s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=349.52s)]
*  So blacks commit more. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=349.72s)]
*  He's saying so as in therefore, as in one could conclude, but Charlie knows he's [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=350.72s)]
*  lying even if he hadn't just lied about the black prison population. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=356.76s)]
*  Charlie is smart enough to know that correlation does not equal causation, but [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=360.0s)]
*  he's hoping that you don't know that. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=363.36s)]
*  So he deploys the word so to make you think he's coming to an obvious conclusion. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=364.88s)]
*  So black instead he's making an illogical leap. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=369.23999999999995s)]
*  Charlie knows that we don't have usable data about who commits. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=372.4s)]
*  It's impossible to have that data since so many go both unreported and or unsolved. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=375.44s)]
*  Charlie knows that we only have data about arrests and convictions. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=380.4s)]
*  I'll come back to that data in a moment. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=383.76s)]
*  What's painfully obvious is that Charlie Kirk isn't interested in understanding [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=385.52s)]
*  the statistics he so carelessly misquotes. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=388.84s)]
*  He's interested in making bad faith arguments. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=391.23999999999995s)]
*  Something that becomes even more obvious in his next point. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=393.56s)]
*  Blacks are 13% of the population and they commit 58% of all the wrong again. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=396.4s)]
*  And loud this time, if Charlie were interested in honesty, he would have [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=400.36s)]
*  mentioned the other 1350 statistic. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=403.96s)]
*  Yes, black people are about 13% of the population, but make up 53% of all exonerations. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=406.36s)]
*  In fact, black people make up 55% of all exonerations. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=413.24s)]
*  Specifically, black people are more likely than any other group in this country to be [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=418.36s)]
*  convicted of. They did not commit. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=422.2s)]
*  And then people like you have the nerve to parade these stats around as though they [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=423.92s)]
*  prove something. The reality is that you probably know these stats, but you leave them [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=427.64s)]
*  out on purpose because to bring that stat into this conversation would make some people [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=431.6s)]
*  think. And that's the last thing a person like you wants. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=436.28000000000003s)]
*  I disagree. I think he doesn't know those stats, but if he did, he also wouldn't mention [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=439.8s)]
*  them. But the reason why I obviously wanted to talk about this is because you have another [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=445.2s)]
*  real life example of an innocent black man who is going to be when everyone, virtually [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=450.8s)]
*  everyone understands that he is not guilty of the that he is about to be for. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=456.96s)]
*  OK, it is an unfortunate, unimaginable cruelty that happens quite frequently in this country. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=461.68s)]
*  It's one of the major reasons why I it's one of the major reasons why I routinely talk [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=468.92s)]
*  against against the death penalty. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=474.2s)]
*  And yet here we are in the United States of America doing it all over again. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=477.28000000000003s)]
*  The unbelievable story that has to be heard and one that is still hard to comprehend once [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=481.48s)]
*  you take it all in. It's one littered with stunning revelations and broken promises and [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=486.32s)]
*  one that puts Missouri's years long fight against overturning wrongful convictions directly [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=490.88s)]
*  in the spotlight. All right, before we get into the rest of the story, I just want to [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=495.64s)]

*  I think it's appropriate or from data brokers that didn't even know existed. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=538.64s)]

*  information isn't getting onto new sites and to new data brokers. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=559.64s)]

*  On August 11th, 1998, Felicia Gale, a 42 year old former reporter for the St. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=591.68s)]
*  Louis Post Dispatch, was brutally in her home in St. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=596.76s)]
*  Louis, Missouri. She had been over 40 times. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=599.56s)]
*  And the knife lodged in her neck in a burglary that had happened just 24 days [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=602.0799999999999s)]
*  before. Another woman, Debra McLean, was in her kitchen with a knife taken from [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=608.28s)]
*  the home in eerily similar scene to Alicia Gale. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=612.3599999999999s)]
*  The investigation languished for months. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=615.56s)]
*  Despite the similarities between they they they claimed that it was a [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=617.6s)]
*  a burglary, that part is important because it ties it back to Marcellus Williams. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=624.84s)]
*  The two of the knives being left at both [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=630.6400000000001s)]
*  scenes, there being bloody footprints in Gale's house, the police had little to go [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=631.96s)]
*  on, no eyewitnesses, no leads for either. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=636.24s)]
*  Then a year later, there was a break in the Gale case. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=639.4000000000001s)]
*  It came in the form of a man named Henry Cole, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=642.32s)]
*  a jailhouse informant who had said his cellmate had confessed to the that [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=644.6800000000001s)]
*  eventually led to the arrest of Marcellus Williams. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=647.8000000000001s)]
*  He was charged with Gale's. McLean's remains unsolved to this day. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=650.36s)]
*  But Marcellus was in lockup, so he couldn't have done it. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=653.84s)]
*  The case against Williams for Gale was largely circumstantial. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=656.96s)]
*  This was a very brutal of a woman who was found in her home. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=659.96s)]
*  Having been to death, there were bloody [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=665.16s)]
*  footprints at the scene, fingerprints, hairs found in the victim's hand, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=667.24s)]
*  none of which matched Marcellus. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=671.24s)]
*  Those were not his bloody footprints. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=673.5600000000001s)]
*  Those were not his hairs. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=675.2800000000001s)]
*  And the fingerprints were destroyed. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=676.72s)]
*  The state's prosecution relied heavily on the testimony of two informants who had [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=678.6800000000001s)]
*  been incentivized to testify. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=682.64s)]
*  The only evidence they used to convict him is what we call incentivized [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=684.48s)]
*  informant testimonies, individuals who came forward because they had something to gain. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=687.96s)]
*  The first was Cole. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=692.4000000000001s)]
*  So Marcellus had been in the workhouse and someone who was incarcerated with him. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=693.72s)]
*  Here's this reward money and essentially says, I want this reward money and I want [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=698.76s)]
*  help with my own case and says he won't even testify until he gets that reward money. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=701.84s)]
*  The second was Williams' former girlfriend, Laura Saro. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=705.96s)]
*  In addition, there is another individual, a woman who Marcellus was known to [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=708.88s)]
*  affiliate with, notably the two of them contradict each other in what they say [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=712.8000000000001s)]
*  would have happened and contradict physical evidence that's found at their scene. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=716.64s)]
*  The key piece of evidence brought against him was Gale's laptop, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=719.44s)]
*  which he was said to have sold. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=722.28s)]
*  The last piece of evidence that they use is a laptop that had been taken from the [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=723.9200000000001s)]
*  victim's house that Marcellus did sell. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=727.48s)]
*  But what wasn't presented at trial was that the woman that had come forward and [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=729.16s)]
*  said she had information and manufactured these statements about Marcellus is the [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=734.32s)]
*  person who gave him that laptop. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=738.08s)]
*  And so it wasn't allowed to come out that really the only connection to that is [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=740.12s)]
*  this informant and not Marcellus Williams. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=743.52s)]
*  There were even eyewitnesses who had said they had seen a Saro with the laptop [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=745.72s)]
*  while Marcellus was still in county. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=750.04s)]
*  Usually in cases, the evidence of guilt is overwhelming [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=752.28s)]
*  and the only real issue you can litigate in most cases is whether that was [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=756.92s)]
*  appropriately given. This case was different in that the evidence [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=763.0s)]
*  that they used to convict him was pretty thin and questionable. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=766.96s)]
*  All of this should have been easy to poke holes in for most attorneys, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=771.4399999999999s)]
*  but these problems continued at trial. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=774.4399999999999s)]
*  Since his conviction, Williams has argued in several motions that he received [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=776.4399999999999s)]
*  ineffective counsel during the trial, which came from a public defender assigned to him. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=779.8s)]
*  It's no secret that America's public defender system has been stretched to its [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=784.2s)]
*  breaking point, but nowhere near as much as Missouri, which ranks 49th in the country [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=787.84s)]
*  in spending on indigent defenses. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=792.6800000000001s)]
*  In 2017 alone, 320 public defenders handled 80,000 cases in the state of Missouri. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=794.9200000000001s)]
*  The state has repeatedly vetoed bills [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=801.12s)]
*  that would supply funding to help alleviate this caseload. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=803.12s)]
*  The Missouri State Public Defender System is asking. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=806.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, this case is particularly unique because the prosecutor that convicted [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=809.1600000000001s)]
*  Williams is a prominent figure pushing for a sense to be vacated. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=812.8399999999999s)]
*  This never happens unless an error is [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=815.68s)]
*  particularly egregious on behalf of the prosecutor. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=817.56s)]
*  Another similar case is in Texas with the with the person on death row being a white [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=820.12s)]
*  man where it's not the prosecutor necessarily, but the main detective, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=825.04s)]
*  the lead investigator that is also pushing to to vacate his sentence as well. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=829.0s)]
*  Yes, this is literally every single person involved in this court case [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=836.3599999999999s)]
*  is is is now aware of Marcellus Williams' innocence. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=842.08s)]
*  Every single person. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=848.0s)]

*  And the only person who could stop this from happening right now is the governor. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=853.4s)]
*  The victim's family is is obviously defending the innocence of Marcellus Williams. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=858.8000000000001s)]
*  The I believe jurors themselves have come out and been like we made the wrong [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=864.96s)]

*  He is innocent. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=870.88s)]
*  The only person who can pardon Marcellus Williams and stop him from being by the [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=872.0s)]
*  state is the governor of the governor of Missouri. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=877.08s)]
*  The problem, however, is that the governor of Missouri yesterday came out and said he [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=881.8s)]
*  will not stop this for more taxpayer money. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=887.2s)]
*  They say thousands of defendants are no Biden cannot stop this. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=891.64s)]

*  governor and tell him to stop this. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=900.28s)]
*  He could use the bully pulpit, but he cannot directly legally stop this. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=901.92s)]
*  This is a state level. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=906.4s)]
*  OK, in the United States of America, the president can pardon only at the federal [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=907.92s)]

*  current governor of Missouri waiting less because the office does not have enough [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=919.88s)]
*  attorneys to represent them. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=924.76s)]
*  These people like Williams with [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=926.36s)]
*  inadequate counsel in inevitable outcomes like wrongful convictions. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=927.8s)]
*  Preparing a case for trial is is takes hundreds of hours if done properly. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=932.24s)]
*  And if not done properly, then we end up with all these wrongful convictions. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=939.12s)]
*  A jury selection, Marcellus ended up [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=943.08s)]
*  with the mostly white jury when the prosecution struck six of the seven [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=944.76s)]
*  qualified black jurors when the trial was over. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=948.3199999999999s)]
*  Despite the questionable witnesses and the evidence being all circumstantial, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=951.2s)]
*  they deliberated for less than 90 minutes before finding them guilty. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=955.12s)]
*  There's something in the US judicial system called a Batson challenge that is [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=959.0s)]
*  supposed to prevent the prosecution from striking qualified jurors on the sole [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=962.52s)]
*  ground of group bias, in this case, race. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=966.48s)]
*  This was a black man being tried by an [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=969.64s)]
*  almost entirely white jury for a white woman's death in Missouri in the 1990s. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=971.72s)]
*  To try to argue Batson in a 2003 motion, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=977.88s)]
*  the state indicated that the jurors were [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=980.84s)]
*  struck because the prosecution stated their clothing indicated they were trying [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=982.48s)]
*  to be different, but that was reason enough and not racially motivated. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=986.24s)]
*  So Batson didn't apply. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=989.96s)]
*  For years, Marcellus pleaded his innocence. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=991.4000000000001s)]
*  His case was taken up by multiple different legal teams who fought tooth [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=993.5200000000001s)]
*  and nail to finally get the DNA that they had found on the knife properly tested. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=996.9200000000001s)]
*  It turned out to be another man's profile. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1001.2800000000001s)]
*  There is a DNA testing statute in the Missouri law, but it's real narrowly [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1003.48s)]
*  written, so we just had to make that request in a broader claim of that he was [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1008.28s)]
*  innocent or there's enough doubts about his innocence that he shouldn't be. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1013.16s)]
*  And we can prove it if you let us do this further DNA testing. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1016.44s)]
*  It's not always a weapon like in Marcellus's case where it's left in the [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1020.32s)]
*  victim's body, that's an incredibly obvious piece of evidence. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1024.96s)]
*  To know that that wasn't tested was just shocking. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1030.2s)]
*  It just blew my mind. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1032.56s)]

*  Wouldn't this ruin the governor's reputation in future election, along with [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1034.8s)]
*  the resulting in his local protesting against them? [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1037.24s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1039.24s)]
*  Nobody gives a s***. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1040.52s)]
*  It's another innocent black man being. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1041.84s)]
*  It happens all the time in the United States of America and the U.S. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1043.84s)]
*  Supreme Court genuinely loves continuing with these on a regular basis. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1047.2s)]
*  No, it happens all the time. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1054.08s)]
*  According to Slate, we are currently witnessing the worst spree in three decades. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1056.28s)]
*  OK, this was written in September 23rd, 2024 yesterday. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1062.04s)]
*  This week is shaping up to be a very bad one for opponents in the United States. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1066.68s)]
*  If all goes according to plan, states will put five people in a one week span [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1069.52s)]
*  ending Thursday. That is an unusual, though not unprecedented, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1073.0s)]
*  number of in such a short period of time to understand just how unusual it is. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1076.08s)]
*  Consider that in 2023, the total number of for the entire year was 24, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1080.28s)]
*  less than one every other week in 2022. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1084.36s)]
*  18 people were put for a rate of roughly one every third week. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1087.08s)]
*  Indeed, one would have to go back almost three decades to 1997 to find a parallel [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1090.92s)]
*  to what may unfold this week during a seven day period in May that year. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1095.92s)]
*  Text five people. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1099.28s)]
*  South Carolina, Khalil, a law formerly known as Freddie Owens in his first 2011. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1100.52s)]
*  The others are planned for Tuesday and Thursday in Texas, Missouri, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1105.3600000000001s)]
*  Alabama and Oklahoma, all of which regularly carry out. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1108.44s)]
*  It is just a coincidence that all these states are moving in lockstep. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1111.4s)]
*  Coincidence or not, or a close look at each of the cases and some in which some [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1114.44s)]
*  will be this week highlights not just the kind of horribles that can lead someone [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1118.68s)]
*  on throw, but also many of the penalties crippling problems. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1122.0800000000002s)]
*  This week's include two cases in which there are substantial doubts about whether [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1125.0s)]
*  that person being is actually innocent to others illustrate the fact that that is [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1128.24s)]
*  often used against people who are poor, vulnerable, in many ways broken, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1132.08s)]
*  not against the worst. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1135.8799999999999s)]
*  The fifth highlights America's futile search for a method that will be safe, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1136.8799999999999s)]
*  reliable and humane, which is, of course, ironic to say ridiculous. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1140.1999999999998s)]
*  An oxymoronic statement looking for a method that is safe, reliable and humane. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1144.8799999999999s)]
*  Every aspect of the from the methods used to how you are going to deploy this [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1149.8799999999999s)]
*  in a consistent manner is is completely broken. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1155.0s)]

*  OK, the fact that three of the five people who will be this week are black only [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1163.48s)]
*  underlines the continuing salience of race in determining who gets sentenced. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1166.72s)]
*  And all told this week, Spree should [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1170.28s)]
*  unsettle all Americans, whether or not they support the penalty. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1171.9199999999998s)]

*  country to see why. Let's start with last Friday's of Khalil Allah. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1177.9199999999998s)]
*  He was convicted of the 1997 of Irene Granger Graves, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1181.44s)]
*  a single mother of three who worked as a convenience store clerk. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1185.1200000000001s)]
*  No physical evidence connected a lot of the key evidence against them was [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1188.32s)]
*  testimony from his co-defendant, Stephen Golden, who said Allah shot Graves. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1191.44s)]
*  Golden did so after reaching a deal [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1195.8400000000001s)]
*  with the prosecutors that he would not be given a sentence in return for his [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1197.92s)]
*  testimony. Allah maintained his innocence from the time he was arrested to the day [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1201.32s)]
*  he died. And just before South Carolina put him to new evidence came to light [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1205.16s)]
*  suggesting what he had been saying for years was true. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1208.96s)]
*  Last Wednesday, Golden recanted his testimony and signed an affidavit saying [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1212.0s)]
*  Freddie Owens is not the person who shot Irene Graves at the speedway on November [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1215.7600000000002s)]

*  But neither the South Carolina Supreme [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1225.3200000000002s)]

*  death of Marcellus Williams, the reason why we're talking about this to begin with, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1239.88s)]
*  who is another victim of a miscarriage of justice. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1243.24s)]
*  He would be the third row inmate in the state this year. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1247.92s)]
*  As Newsweek votes, Williams was convicted [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1251.3200000000002s)]
*  of and sentenced in connection with the 1999 of social worker and former [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1254.16s)]

*  There's also, as we said, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1263.0s)]
*  recent DNA evidence that shows that his DNA was not on, like the DNA matched [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1265.36s)]
*  with the knife on the scene of the lodging the neck of the victim did not have his DNA. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1272.8799999999999s)]
*  As Newsweek notes, Williams was convicted [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1281.6s)]
*  of and sentenced in connection with the 1998 of social worker and former [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1283.72s)]

*  that connected him to the scene of the crime. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1289.8s)]
*  Remember, a knife attack is a deeply personal form of, you know, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1291.4799999999998s)]
*  obvious, insane, okay, but due to the personal nature of the knife itself, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1298.12s)]
*  it is virtually impossible to not leave any DNA at the scene of the knife. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1303.52s)]
*  Okay, impossible. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1307.4799999999998s)]
*  So while forensic evidence oftentimes can get things wrong, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1309.6799999999998s)]

*  So now he getting the chance and the shot he needed. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1748.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, by the way, the changes of the [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1751.96s)]
*  Democratic Party's criminal justice platform you may have missed is, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1753.36s)]
*  for example, there is no mention of police brutality in the 2024 platform, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1758.48s)]
*  as opposed to the 2020 platform that did talk about police brutality. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1763.32s)]
*  And beyond that, they've also removed [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1766.6799999999998s)]
*  language on working towards abolishing the penalty. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1768.6799999999998s)]
*  At what time is he supposed to be in an hour and 20 minutes? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1772.6399999999999s)]
*  Yes, they're the GOP. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1775.4399999999998s)]
*  They're the GOP, but just gay now is correct. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1777.48s)]
*  Yes, that is what the Democratic Party has become. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1779.84s)]
*  Gay GOP. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1782.36s)]
*  That'll go away soon, too, though. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1783.4399999999998s)]
*  They'll just become full blown GOP. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1785.0s)]
*  You know, they'll do away with that, too. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1786.8799999999999s)]
*  Don't worry. It's coming for them to look over the DNA evidence. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1789.1999999999998s)]
*  But the sentiment was short lived because [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1793.24s)]
*  what happened following that was nothing short of stunning. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1795.0s)]
*  The border inquiry is something unique to the state of Missouri. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1797.92s)]
*  It's a law that's been rarely invoked, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1800.8799999999999s)]
*  and each of the few times it has yielded bizarre results. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1802.84s)]
*  The late 90s, the then Governor Mel Carnahan issued a statement and invoked [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1806.08s)]
*  the border inquiry to look into the case of William Theodore Boliak Jr. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1810.36s)]
*  Carnahan then died in a plane crash. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1814.4s)]
*  And because of the wording in his stay, [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1816.64s)]
*  Boliak remains on the road to this day with this being forever stayed. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1818.6s)]
*  In Marcellus's case, the border inquiry [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1822.4s)]
*  that then Governor Eric Greitens requested to convene did in fact meet. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1824.24s)]
*  It was the first move in a while and gave him and his legal team hope. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1828.04s)]
*  Are you hopeful now with this border inquiry? [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1831.64s)]
*  I'm hopeful, but I don't believe or trust in the judicial system. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1833.64s)]
*  But I'm hopeful that some good will come out of it one way or another. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1838.8s)]
*  And I'll just leave it at that. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1844.08s)]
*  Marcellus's hesitation here, born of a lengthy and complicated legal [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1847.16s)]
*  process that had kept him behind bars for years, proved to be prescient. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1850.92s)]
*  This hope is indeed short lived because as the board began to meet, something happened. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1855.44s)]
*  Missouri Republican Governor Eric Greitens once considered [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1859.88s)]
*  Yeah, the only other group that could potentially halt is the US Supreme Court, [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1863.48s)]
*  which it, of course, as of literally five minutes ago, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1867.44s)]
*  declined to halt the Missouri inmate Marcellus Williams, knowing full well, [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1871.48s)]
*  knowing full well of his innocence. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1875.8000000000002s)]
*  A lot of people will be like, oh, I don't understand. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1877.96s)]
*  What's the purpose here? [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1880.9199999999998s)]
*  Like, what's the reason? [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1881.9199999999998s)]
*  It's because they're bad people. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1882.8799999999999s)]
*  They're evil people and they like doing evil. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1884.12s)]
*  That's it. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1886.24s)]
*  There is literally no other justification for this. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1886.8799999999999s)]
*  OK, it's because they are evil people. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1889.2s)]
*  The Supreme Court loves, loves it. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1892.28s)]
*  They love defending the black men. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1896.44s)]
*  There is no other way. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1900.1599999999999s)]
*  There is no other way to point to this reality. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1901.8s)]
*  Just literally, if you know anything about the United States Supreme Court, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1904.1599999999999s)]
*  you know this, OK? [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1908.04s)]
*  They do this all the time, [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1909.88s)]
*  specifically intellectually disabled black inmates. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1912.1200000000001s)]
*  They love that. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1915.16s)]
*  Yeah, Antonin Scalia, they say it out loud. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1917.8400000000001s)]
*  Mere factual innocence is no reason not to carry out a sentence properly reached. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1920.6000000000001s)]
*  I repeat, mere factual innocence is no reason not to carry out a sentence [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1927.1200000000001s)]
*  properly reached. OK? [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1934.16s)]
*  A miscarriage of justice is not a miscarriage of justice at all. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1935.92s)]
*  As long as the sentence was properly reached, it does not matter. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1941.84s)]
*  We will innocent people as long as the court proceedings were properly conducted. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1947.88s)]
*  I mean, if you think that that is the worst thing that Antonin Scalia has said, [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1954.24s)]
*  that's Antonin Scalia, who was justified the use of torture in the United States [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1957.8s)]
*  Supreme Court by pointing to 24, a fictional work by claiming that if there [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1961.72s)]
*  was a terrorist that wanted to nuke D.C. like in the television show 24 and torture [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1968.72s)]
*  was the only method to get the information out of him, of course, you'd be pro [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1974.3200000000002s)]
*  torture or Antonin Scalia, who also once famously made the slippery slope argument [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1977.88s)]
*  about gay people getting married. If gay people can get married, then what's next? [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1983.48s)]
*  What if they want to marry dogs? [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1989.3600000000001s)]
*  That is literally both of those things are things that Antonin Scalia said and did [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1991.52s)]
*  and defended positions that he said and publicly defended in dissent. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=1996.5600000000002s)]
*  And you can learn about this in an introductory [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2000.76s)]
*  constitutional law class as I did when I was in college. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2004.3200000000002s)]
*  The rising star in the GOP has just resigned this afternoon amid an [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2008.88s)]
*  impeachment effort sparked by a pair of scandals. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2014.0400000000002s)]
*  Today, I am announcing that I will resign [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2016.76s)]
*  as governor of Missouri, effective Friday, June 1st at 5 p.m. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2019.6000000000001s)]
*  When former Missouri Governor Eric Gritons issued that stay, he impaneled a special [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2024.76s)]
*  board to examine the facts of the case and make a recommendation. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2029.52s)]
*  But then a personal scandal forced Gritons out, leaving the board in jeopardy [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2033.2800000000002s)]
*  and the future of Marcellus Williams entirely unclear. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2037.64s)]
*  The governor who succeeded Gritons, Mike [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2042.2800000000002s)]
*  Parson, came in as someone tough on crime, which caused many to believe the board was [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2044.3600000000001s)]
*  in jeopardy. I remember CBS coming into town saying, [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2048.12s)]
*  what's what's going to happen with Marcellus Williams? [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2050.7999999999997s)]
*  Will you keep the board of inquiries still intact? [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2052.92s)]
*  And he said, you know, I'm going to let them do what Gritons set them up to do. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2055.4s)]
*  Now, if you think Governor Parson is a man [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2059.72s)]
*  who doesn't utilize the pardon power, well, you'd be wrong. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2063.6s)]
*  He has utilized the pardon power. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2068.0s)]
*  The governor of Missouri, Governor Mike Parson, [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2072.08s)]
*  I almost called him Mike Parson, is just he doesn't like to use it against certain [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2076.08s)]
*  people. Here is Missouri Governor pardoning the St. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2081.0s)]
*  Louis couple who aimed guns at protesters during the Black Lives Matter protest. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2084.16s)]
*  If you recall, Mark and Patricia McCloskey, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2088.08s)]
*  who gained prominence for confronting demonstrators, had each pleaded guilty [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2090.92s)]
*  to a misdemeanor charge. They were pardoned. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2095.7200000000003s)]
*  The Missouri governor shortens the DWI [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2098.7200000000003s)]
*  prison sentence of former Chiefs Assistant Coach Britt Reid. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2100.8s)]
*  Missouri Governor Mike Parson on Friday [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2103.72s)]
*  shortened the prison sentence of former Kansas City Chiefs Assistant Coach Britt [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2106.24s)]
*  Reid for a drunken driving crash that seriously injured a five year old girl. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2109.6s)]
*  Hmm. Yeah, you don't have to make this up. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2115.16s)]
*  They give you plenty of evidence. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2117.52s)]
*  OK, you know, the board was canceled. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2119.2799999999997s)]
*  Will they meet? [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2122.6s)]
*  Will they make a recommendation to you? [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2124.2799999999997s)]
*  And what will you do then? [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2126.64s)]
*  I would assume they would. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2128.12s)]
*  I heard they're not going to. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2129.4s)]
*  So I think once they make that recommendation, [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2130.72s)]
*  if they do meet, then we'll discuss that at the time. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2132.6s)]
*  And now we found that that's not the case. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2134.84s)]
*  Parson, of course, dissolved the board, [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2136.92s)]
*  ending the state's years of work towards Marcelus. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2138.72s)]
*  Are you actually being serious? [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2141.68s)]
*  Dog, look in front of your eyes like it's not like I'm making this up. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2143.08s)]
*  It's in front of you. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2146.2799999999997s)]
*  Like these are things that he has done. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2147.32s)]
*  Every single every single thing that I have mentioned is factually accurate. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2149.2799999999997s)]
*  OK, taining a hearing after everything [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2153.68s)]
*  Marcelus had been through can be thrown into turmoil for things outside of his [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2156.24s)]
*  control seemed unbelievable. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2160.32s)]
*  How did the scandal plagued the governor of Missouri's resignation [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2162.0s)]

*  The funny thing about Parsons tough on crime stance and these actions are that [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2168.92s)]
*  they only seem to apply to certain people in certain cases for their confounding. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2172.96s)]
*  How justice works within the state of Missouri. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2177.1600000000003s)]
*  Parson has been granting pardons and clemency at an exceptional rate more than [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2179.6800000000003s)]
*  any governor of Missouri since the 1940s. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2184.0s)]
*  But this has a specific political tent to it. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2186.56s)]
*  Parson is just odd. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2189.04s)]
*  Oh, he he covers this. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2190.56s)]
*  Never mind. OK, it's just odd because he has given out a lot more pardons. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2192.0s)]
*  Then then, you know, then most other governors. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2197.96s)]
*  So why is it that in this circumstance, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2201.68s)]
*  when there's a dude who is straight up innocent, he is refusing to pardon him. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2204.36s)]
*  Clemency only comes from people like Mark and Patricia McCloskey, [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2208.36s)]
*  the couple who became famous for waving guns at Black Lives Matter protesters. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2211.44s)]

*  McCloskey. The St. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2222.32s)]

*  demonstrators in their central West End neighborhood. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2227.28s)]
*  As of August 20, 22, 90 percent of Parsons pardons have been white petitioners, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2229.8s)]
*  which when you look at the demographics [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2234.48s)]
*  of those incarcerated in the state, seems nearly impossible. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2236.28s)]
*  For those outside of Parsons purview, the justice system seems. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2239.52s)]
*  Let's just hold on. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2242.96s)]
*  I need you to understand one more time this fact. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2244.2s)]
*  As of August 20, 22, 90 percent of the governor of Missouri, [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2248.3599999999997s)]

*  white people comprise 55 percent of the Missouri jail population. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2267.68s)]
*  The state seems nearly impossible for those outside of Parsons purview. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2272.16s)]
*  The justice system seems to lean its full weight on them. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2276.32s)]
*  Parson dissolved the board of inquiry [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2279.56s)]
*  looking into Marcellus's case and took no further action. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2281.48s)]
*  We filed a civil lawsuit saying we don't believe the governor has the authority [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2284.88s)]
*  to dissolve that board because he had to wait until they finished their work. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2289.28s)]
*  Once they finished their work, he could do what he wanted with his competency [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2293.32s)]
*  powers, but the order had already been there. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2295.56s)]
*  Unfortunately, the Missouri Supreme Court disagreed with that and recently [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2297.24s)]
*  dismissed that civil case. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2300.96s)]
*  And at that point, the attorney general argued there was no other reason [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2303.0s)]
*  that an update shouldn't be set. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2306.36s)]

*  This is the last part of the process. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2310.76s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2313.04s)]
*  Missouri Governor Mike Parson has also said that he is potentially going to either [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2314.1600000000003s)]
*  release or shorten the prison sentence of the first Kansas City police officer [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2322.2000000000003s)]
*  ever convicted of black man, signaling in recent comments his disapproval [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2325.4s)]
*  of the former detective's incarceration. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2329.04s)]
*  A Republican in the final months of his time in office came close to a promising [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2331.84s)]
*  commutation or pardon for the KCPD detective Eric Devel Canary in a radio [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2335.16s)]
*  interview last week. The comments are furthest. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2341.72s)]
*  The comments are the furthest. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2344.76s)]
*  The governor, a former Polk County [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2345.96s)]
*  sheriff, has gone and telegraphing that he plans to take action in the case. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2347.36s)]
*  There is not a week that goes by that somebody is not reaching out to me about [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2350.28s)]
*  that issue, and we're going to see what happens here before long. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2353.84s)]
*  I'll leave it at that. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2356.64s)]
*  But, you know, I don't like where he's at. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2358.04s)]
*  I'll just say that Devel Canary was found guilty at a trial in Jackson County in [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2360.2400000000002s)]
*  2021 on charges of second degree involuntary manslaughter and armed [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2364.32s)]
*  criminal action of 26 year old Cameron Lamb. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2367.48s)]
*  Devel Canary is currently serving a six [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2370.12s)]
*  year sentence after shooting Lamb as Lamb was backing up his pickup truck into his [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2372.36s)]
*  garage. Devel Canary is believed to be in custody in and out of state prison after [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2376.4s)]
*  previously being held in state prison in Fulton. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2380.52s)]
*  The Missouri Supreme Court has declined to [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2382.4s)]
*  overturn his convictions, leaving commutation and pardon by the governor as [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2383.8s)]
*  his only viable option to leave prison. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2387.52s)]
*  All of this speaks to how baffling the system in the state of Missouri is. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2389.72s)]
*  Missouri is one of the more difficult legal systems to navigate, in particular [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2394.16s)]
*  because of the opposition that every innocence case has faced. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2399.44s)]
*  Even when clear and convincing evidence [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2402.6s)]
*  emerges in a case, overturning a wrongful conviction here is an uphill battle. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2404.36s)]
*  I had a case, it wasn't a throw case, where the guy to the two witnesses who [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2408.8s)]
*  identified him as this guy both recanted their stories. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2413.64s)]
*  We tried to get it back in front of the trial court here in Kansas City. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2416.6s)]
*  The state opposed it and the judge said, I can't hear this. Denied. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2420.4s)]
*  And he's still in prison. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2424.7599999999998s)]
*  We're still trying to get him out. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2426.12s)]
*  The appeals process in the United States is already a lengthy and complicated one, [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2427.7599999999998s)]
*  but in Missouri it is especially tough. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2431.6s)]
*  There's strict filing deadlines, limited resources for post-conviction [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2433.72s)]
*  investigations, procedural barriers, restrictive criteria for DNA testing, [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2437.48s)]
*  and a high bar for introducing new evidence. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2442.64s)]
*  You can have a winning case and the court won't hear it because of a procedural [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2444.72s)]
*  default, and that happens time and time again. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2450.16s)]
*  It's happened in Missouri numerous times. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2453.56s)]
*  The guys have been without really any [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2455.92s)]
*  meaningful review of their cases because of that. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2457.6s)]
*  All of these hurdles have directly hindered [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2460.68s)]
*  Marcellus Williams' pursuit of the truth. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2462.6s)]
*  In Marcellus' case, we were not necessarily [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2464.7599999999998s)]
*  defaulted on a lot of stuff, but we were forwarded at every turn in trying to get [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2467.96s)]
*  court authorization to get access to evidence that could exonerate him. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2473.24s)]
*  Procedurally and legally, the state of Missouri is set up in a way that [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2477.9199999999996s)]
*  continually thwarts attempts to seek justice. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2481.16s)]
*  But the power the attorney general holds [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2484.48s)]
*  in the state further complicates things and leads to horrific situations that [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2486.3599999999997s)]
*  honestly shocked me the further I went down the rabbit hole. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2491.04s)]
*  The attorney general's office in the state [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2494.2s)]
*  of Missouri has fought tooth and nail against every appeal and every hearing [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2496.08s)]
*  in the last several decades. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2500.2s)]
*  When they fight it, they fight to just prevent a hearing from even happening. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2501.6s)]
*  And that's what we see time and time again, this argument of finality over fairness. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2505.44s)]
*  We just need to be done and not that we just need to get it right. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2509.36s)]
*  When you have an office that takes these [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2512.6800000000003s)]
*  really hard line approaches, there's not a lot of room for the facts [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2516.08s)]
*  or justice in those cracks in between. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2521.2400000000002s)]
*  Combined with the laws the state has enacted over these years, [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2524.12s)]
*  it has caused so many problems for those arguing wrongful convictions. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2527.08s)]
*  If you've got evidence that you got an unfair trial or if you got [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2530.7999999999997s)]
*  or wrongfully convicted, it shouldn't matter that there's a procedural [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2535.8799999999997s)]
*  problem in the case, the court ought to hear it. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2539.72s)]
*  Just a few weeks ago, the AG's office [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2542.3599999999997s)]
*  blocked the release of Christopher Dunn, who had served 30 years for a crime [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2544.48s)]
*  he didn't commit. Out top story, he was just minutes away from walking free. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2548.4s)]
*  The 11th hour moved by the Missouri [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2553.24s)]

*  A circuit court judge overturned his conviction on the basis that both [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2558.6s)]

*  On Monday, a St. Louis circuit court judge overturned his conviction. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2570.76s)]
*  But Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey appealed his release on Wednesday. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2574.92s)]
*  That same like you have to understand, like this is just straight white supremacy. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2579.44s)]
*  Right. Like if you're asking what the going on, [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2583.88s)]
*  like how do we get here? How does this happen? [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2587.6s)]
*  It is just pure, unfiltered, unvarnished white supremacy. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2590.7599999999998s)]
*  That's it. Like what purpose? [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2594.92s)]
*  What kind of, what kind of [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2597.92s)]

*  because ultimately that force is used against those we have decided need [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2881.92s)]

*  So if you can prove your innocence and you were not sentenced, [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2930.36s)]

*  Cassidy by the Missouri Supreme Court, [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2939.52s)]
*  the court decided that freestanding claims of actual innocence where a person [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2941.48s)]
*  asserts they are factually innocent of which they were convicted, [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2945.6s)]
*  even if there were no procedural errors in the trial, are only recognizable for [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2949.0s)]
*  individuals on the row. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2953.56s)]
*  The decision effectively closed off a crucial avenue for potentially innocent [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2955.04s)]
*  prisoners serving non-sentences to challenge their convictions based solely [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2959.6s)]
*  on new evidence of their innocence. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2963.36s)]
*  In 2016, the Court of Appeals in Missouri said it didn't matter essentially how [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2965.12s)]
*  strong the evidence of innocence was. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2970.56s)]
*  The Missouri Supreme Court had only found [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2973.04s)]
*  innocence in a penalty case, not in any other case. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2974.7200000000003s)]
*  And so it did not have the power to overturn Rodney's conviction because he was [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2977.44s)]
*  not sentenced. That is still essentially the law today. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2982.2400000000002s)]
*  Many individuals, myself included, have asked the Missouri Supreme Court to [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=2986.76s)]

*  Shut up. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3063.6s)]
*  Jesus Christ, dude. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3064.8399999999997s)]
*  What are you defending here? [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3066.3599999999997s)]
*  Like, what are you defending here? [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3068.2s)]
*  Please, what are you defending? [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3070.4s)]
*  Oh, the attorney general of Missouri is not a white supremacist. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3072.4s)]
*  He's just a bad person. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3075.2799999999997s)]
*  Like, what are you? [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3076.56s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3078.04s)]
*  Is he your dad, dude? [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3079.24s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3080.4s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3081.08s)]
*  But what a distinction without a difference. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3081.92s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3084.0s)]
*  Please get a grip. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3085.44s)]
*  Anyway, the top of the hour is a break is here. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3087.04s)]
*  OK, I'm just I'm not even going to fucking say it. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3090.2000000000003s)]
*  It's too late. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3093.04s)]
*  Can't have a hearing. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3094.44s)]
*  Finally, after the date was set, the state decided it would allow an evidentiary [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3095.52s)]
*  hearing for the DNA evidence. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3100.04s)]
*  Then the AG, Andrew Bailey, filed a writ of probation to dismiss the hearing. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3101.6800000000003s)]
*  The court rejected this and the hearing will still proceed on August 21st. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3106.52s)]
*  But not for lack of trying. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3110.2s)]
*  What's so disturbing about Marcelos's case is that we have in January a prosecutor [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3112.3199999999997s)]
*  filing motion to overturn his conviction on the basis of his innocence in January. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3119.48s)]
*  And then just six months later, an update being set before a hearing on that [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3125.2799999999997s)]
*  motion has been held. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3129.88s)]
*  It's a very real possibility that because of the speed in which the courts work, [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3131.56s)]
*  that the results of the evidentiary hearing will not be known until after [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3136.04s)]
*  Marcelos Williams is on September 24th. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3140.96s)]
*  There's no coming back from an and where there's DNA evidence and a prosecutor [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3143.6s)]
*  saying, I want a hearing on this DNA evidence because I believe this person is [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3149.96s)]
*  innocent to not have that hearing, to just say it's too late, but really say [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3154.4s)]
*  something about what it means to try to seek justice in our system. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3160.32s)]
*  Beyond the convincing DNA evidence, [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3164.3999999999996s)]
*  the ineffective counsel, the contradicting eyewitnesses, something else has come to [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3166.7599999999998s)]
*  light, notably while Noah was making his documentary. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3171.12s)]
*  A private investigator had spoken with Asaro before she had passed and said she [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3174.2s)]
*  had recanted her story saying Marcelos had nothing to do with the. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3178.12s)]
*  Somebody was following Laura Asaro before she passed. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3181.52s)]
*  But apparently she said she said he didn't do it. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3185.04s)]
*  He didn't do it. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3187.3199999999997s)]
*  She died before they could get a sworn [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3189.16s)]
*  affidavit. They tried to get an affidavit to her. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3191.0s)]
*  And she passed before she could. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3193.88s)]
*  Even in spite of all that, all the other evidence in this case that points [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3195.5200000000004s)]
*  to Marcelos Williams innocent should lead to his exoneration or at least a new trial. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3199.44s)]
*  But only time will tell if that happens. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3204.76s)]
*  The governor of Missouri's AG will fight this case to the bitter end. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3206.88s)]
*  And even if his conviction is overturned, [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3210.1600000000003s)]
*  they could block his release from prison like they did Christopher Dunn and Sandra [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3212.2400000000002s)]
*  Hemi. Of course, on top of all this are the ethics of the penalty, which are for [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3216.5200000000004s)]
*  another time. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3221.44s)]
*  It doesn't matter where someone stands on the penalty here. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3222.08s)]
*  If we want to have that system, there has to be the possibility for somebody to have [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3225.16s)]
*  their innocence heard before a step is taken that can never be undone. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3231.7599999999998s)]
*  This entire journey has disillusioned me [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3235.6s)]
*  on the justice system's approach to wrongful convictions and even more so on [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3237.64s)]
*  Missouri's fight for finality over fairness, but has also taught me that if a case [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3242.2s)]
*  gets enough attention, it very well could mean life for the person at the center. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3246.6s)]
*  He a good man, he an honorable man, he an innocent man. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3250.8799999999997s)]
*  So that's that. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3255.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3256.8399999999997s)]
*  Thanks again, Delete Me for making this video possible. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3257.3599999999997s)]
*  I just wanted to also say thanks to Noah and his crew and all the work they did. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3260.04s)]
*  If you want to know how to get involved, [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3264.8399999999997s)]
*  people to donate to you, petitions to sign, congressmen to annoy. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3266.7999999999997s)]
*  I've included some links down below. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3270.8799999999997s)]
*  This was this this guy did phenomenal work, Corey Popp. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3273.2s)]
*  I don't know what his other, [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3278.3999999999996s)]
*  you know, I don't know what his other videos look like. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3281.3599999999997s)]
*  I guess he's made three. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3283.56s)]
*  It will happen in an hour. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3284.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3300.9199999999996s)]
*  Oh, yeah. If you go to facts, zero dot com, you can send a you can send a fax to [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3301.3999999999996s)]
*  the office of the governor of Missouri. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3306.92s)]
*  Many people are doing that. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3308.84s)]
*  But I think that this is beyond what it calls for help. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DZXUwD_a0&t=3310.1600000000003s)]
