# Israel Intensifies Air Strikes On Lebanon | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [October 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4)
*  The only thing holding back, I guess, Biden from giving the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=0.0s)]
*  total go ahead Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE Bahrain and Kuwait [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=5.04s)]
*  have declared neutrality and will not allow the US to use [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=9.42s)]
*  their air bases against it on that probably won't stop Iran [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=12.24s)]
*  from hitting them, I suspect. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=16.4s)]
*  So we had to blow it up. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=23.68s)]
*  There's some new details tonight on the election, which is so [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=25.44s)]
*  central to this war that we are covering here tonight. And a [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=28.72s)]
*  specific point about where Harris is gaining ground crucial [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=32.839999999999996s)]
*  swing states and we'll tell you why. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=36.28s)]
*  Yeah, we blow up orphanage because terror baby Ukrainian [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=37.68s)]
*  Nazi baby, we find copy of Mein Kampf, Adolf Hitler, we find [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=41.96s)]
*  copy of Mein Kampf in Ukrainian orphanage. That's why we blow [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=46.28s)]
*  up orphanage. This is Ukrainian Nazi baby. That's, that would be [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=50.04s)]
*  equivalent of CNN literally doing that for Russia. Now, for [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=55.48s)]
*  you, if that comes across as like completely insane, that's [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=60.4s)]
*  because it is. Okay, it is. It is insane when Israel does it. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=63.72s)]
*  And it's insane if Russia were to do it. Yeah. If Russia were [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=67.16s)]
*  to try and do that on CNN, which is laughable, of course, no [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=70.8s)]
*  Russian general is going on CNN. Okay. No one would believe it. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=73.19999999999999s)]
*  But when Israel says it, everyone's like, Oh, well, you [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=77.24s)]
*  know, it's probably real. And if you don't think so, you're [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=79.86s)]
*  anti-Semitic. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=82.84s)]
*  Continue the fight until Israel ends its war on Gaza. And despite [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=84.28s)]
*  the setbacks, Hezbollah has demonstrated its capabilities to [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=89.0s)]
*  Israeli troops. The military has confirmed the killing of several [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=92.4s)]
*  soldiers since a ground operation in Lebanon began on [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=96.56s)]
*  Tuesday. So is Hezbollah prepared for a long battle with [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  Israel? And how will it face discontent among Lebanese [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=103.84s)]
*  civilians at the prospect of another war? We'll discuss that [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=106.6s)]
*  and more with our panel of guests. But first this report from [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=110.83999999999999s)]
*  Ferdi Akkar. Israeli strikes pound Dahiya in southern Beirut, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=114.11999999999999s)]
*  just some of many in the past two weeks. Hezbollah's stronghold, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=118.32s)]
*  it was here that the group's leader Hassan Nasrallah was [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=122.8s)]
*  killed in a major attack last Friday. It was the heaviest of [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=125.56s)]
*  many blows Hezbollah has sustained since October 7th, but [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  not the first. In September, an Israeli airstrike killed Ibrahim [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=133.0s)]
*  Akil, the commander of the elite Radwan force. And in July, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=137.24s)]
*  Hezbollah chief of staff, Fuad Shukr, met the same fate. In [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=141.88s)]
*  September, the group suffered what it described as one of its [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=145.56s)]
*  worst intelligence breaches. Thousands of communication [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=148.60000000000002s)]
*  devices across Lebanon exploded in coordinated attacks, killing [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=152.36s)]
*  nearly 40 people, including children and injuring thousands [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=156.76000000000002s)]
*  of civilians. The Israeli military says its air raid [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=160.68s)]
*  campaign in southern and eastern Lebanon has destroyed dozens [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=163.60000000000002s)]
*  of Hezbollah targets. You weren't that far off with your [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=167.24s)]
*  Russian bid. Russia bizarrely includes Sims three among [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=169.88s)]
*  evidence of staged assassination plot. Russian security services [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=172.96s)]
*  have been accused of inevitably staging a Ukrainian neo Nazi [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=176.36s)]
*  plot to assassinate a pro Kremlin journalist observers believe [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=178.52s)]
*  that agents planning evidence somehow confused the three [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  mobile phone SIM cards for the video game The Sims three. Well, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=183.48000000000002s)]
*  I have to believe this, you know, I have to believe this. And [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=187.28s)]
*  if I don't, it's anti semitic. It's also killed hundreds of [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=191.52s)]
*  people. But the group says it won't give up. I guess it must [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=194.48s)]
*  have been true. Hezbollah will continue with its goals and its [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=198.04s)]
*  presence in the field. The command system and the Mujahideen [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=204.44s)]
*  will continue following your plan. Our dear secretary general [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=208.35999999999999s)]
*  with the same precision and the steps you have drawn up. The [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=212.2s)]
*  Israeli military believes it has seriously degraded Hezbollah and [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=215.4s)]
*  announced a ground operation inside Lebanon earlier this week. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=219.04s)]
*  But Hezbollah is operating on familiar terrain. It has already [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=222.92000000000002s)]
*  killed several Israeli soldiers. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=226.48000000000002s)]
*  Oh, man. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=228.52s)]
*  That makes me so sad. Well, I have a really good suggestion. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=231.16000000000003s)]
*  Okay, I have a really good suggestion. Are you guys ready [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=236.08s)]
*  for this? Hold up. Big time suggestion. This will change the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=238.56s)]
*  outcome of Israeli society is called don't fucking invade [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=244.48000000000002s)]
*  Lebanon. Okay. And I have a secondary suggestion on top of [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=249.2s)]
*  that. It's called stop doing genocide in Gaza. This will fix [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=253.76s)]
*  all of your problems. Okay. Really cool idea. Definitely [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=258.24s)]
*  should try it at least a little bit. Do you think Israel could [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=263.36s)]
*  get even more conservative support if they said started [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=266.03999999999996s)]
*  saying this is a war on the woke mind virus? Dude, they're [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=268.36s)]
*  already they're already maxed out on their conservative [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=272.15999999999997s)]
*  support. I don't even think I don't think that there is [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=275.28s)]
*  anything more than they can get. They're already like at 99%. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=279.0s)]
*  You know, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=282.32s)]
*  Hezbollah was born as a guerrilla movement. And this is [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=282.84s)]
*  where it's most comfortable quite frankly, engaging in these [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=287.4s)]
*  sorts of engagements on the ground in these kinds of [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=290.88s)]
*  confrontations. And of course, they have a fair amount of [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=295.15999999999997s)]
*  experience at doing [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=298.91999999999996s)]
*  bro, the only people that will be upset about not invading [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=300.08s)]
*  Lebanon is the semen brigade, because they all of a sudden no [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=306.24s)]
*  longer have semen to collect. That's it. I feel like that's a [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=310.48s)]
*  sacrifice that everyone should be willing to make. Okay, I know [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=315.88s)]
*  the goon platoon works very hard. Okay, they work very hard [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=320.6s)]
*  to extract come directly from the penises and the ball sacks of [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=325.59999999999997s)]
*  fallen Israeli soldiers. I love that there are still people I [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=331.96s)]
*  love that there are still people who go is that really a thing [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=336.47999999999996s)]
*  every time I talk about it? Every time I talk about it. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=338.88s)]
*  There's always a motherfucker that's like what? Not Google it [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=342.11999999999995s)]
*  Google it. That'd be so fucking funny because woke mind virus [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=346.32s)]
*  already something that is some sort of anti semitic undertone [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=349.15999999999997s)]
*  and be like if Israel invaded Lebanon and said they're trying [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=351.32s)]
*  to stop the great replacement. Yeah, the thing is, they are [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=353.28000000000003s)]
*  doing that. They also do have the woke mind virus shit [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=356.76s)]
*  embedded. So like, it's not that far off. They literally are [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=360.08s)]
*  doing that. Also, especially like your Netanyahu, whether you [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=364.8s)]
*  have a New York Times article out, what do you mean? So what [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=370.2s)]
*  what? It's not incorrect. It's true. Israel has a cum [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=373.92s)]
*  extraction squad that is real. That's a real thing. It's such a [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=378.68s)]
*  real thing that they literally have made YouTube videos about [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=382.84s)]
*  it like the IDF own personal YouTube channel has released a [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=387.56s)]
*  YouTube video about the semen brigade. So you know, it's not [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=391.0s)]
*  like I I didn't make it up. I wish it was made up. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=395.4s)]
*  This in Syria over the past decade, and I think that it's [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=399.88s)]
*  quite telling that in in some of the first encounters, Israeli [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=405.08s)]
*  forces have already suffered significant losses. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=410.08s)]
*  The extent of the damage to the armed groups capabilities is [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=413.88s)]
*  unclear. It continues to fire missiles into Israel. And it has [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=417.0s)]
*  10s of 1000s of fighters well armed with the backing of Iran. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=421.47999999999996s)]
*  Hezbollah says it won't surrender until Israel ends its [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=425.52s)]
*  war on Gaza. Freddie a car Al Jazeera for Inside Story. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=428.84s)]
*  Let's bring in our guests from Beirut. We are joined by Sammy [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=433.15999999999997s)]
*  Atilla, who is the founding director of the policy initiative [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=438.12s)]
*  and independent Lebanese think tank in London. Yazid Sayah, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=442.48s)]
*  senior fellow of the Malcolm H. Kear Carnegie Middle East Center [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=447.40000000000003s)]
*  and in Geneva, Joseph Dhar visiting professor at Luzon [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=451.64000000000004s)]
*  University and author of the book Hezbollah, the political economy [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=455.36s)]
*  of Lebanon's party of God. Welcome to the program. Sammy, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=460.20000000000005s)]
*  after a series of major setbacks, can Hezbollah rebuild itself? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=464.24s)]
*  Well, first of all, thank you so much for having me on the show. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=469.59999999999997s)]
*  Hezbollah has taken major blows in the last two weeks, as you [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=473.47999999999996s)]
*  very well said, the assassination of its leader, Sayed Hassan [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=476.84s)]
*  Nasrallah is a huge blow. Its senior leadership has been [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=480.08s)]
*  disemmited, disemmited, decapitated, sorry. And obviously [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=484.28s)]
*  the attacks on it via the pagers and other communication [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=488.64s)]
*  channels really weakened the party. However, I think what [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=492.48s)]
*  we're seeing right now is that Hezbollah is ready for the war [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=497.12s)]
*  on the ground. In fact, Hezbollah has been preparing for [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=500.6s)]
*  the war on the ground. It's the war that it has prepared for, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=503.64000000000004s)]
*  for many, many years, for probably for 18 years. Unlike the [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=506.84000000000003s)]
*  war or the face of the war that preceded this, which was an [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=510.52000000000004s)]
*  intelligence war, a war that obviously with full airstrikes [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=514.16s)]
*  on Lebanon, Hezbollah is not strong in this kind of war. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=518.5600000000001s)]
*  Hezbollah is waiting for the war on the ground. And in fact, the [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=522.64s)]
*  last two days we've seen some major hits to the Israeli army. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=525.36s)]
*  So given that the command and control system is still intact, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=529.6s)]
*  and given they're still able to throw missiles at Israel, it [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=534.6s)]
*  seems from their performance on the ground that they have [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=539.12s)]
*  rethinking the initiative and they're able to inflict at least [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=543.04s)]
*  some pain to the Israeli army. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=547.6s)]
*  Yazid, if we go back a few weeks ago, you see that Hezbollah has [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=549.48s)]
*  lost its top military commander for Ad Shukr, its top political [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=554.84s)]
*  leader, Hassan Nasrallah, its number three, Ali Karaki, the [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=559.68s)]
*  leadership of its elite force, Aridwan. A sizeable portion of [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=563.76s)]
*  its stockpile has been destroyed, according to Israeli [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=568.52s)]
*  military commanders. Is it fair to say that Hezbollah's main goal [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=572.84s)]
*  now is to survive this conflict without further major blows? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=577.32s)]
*  I'm not sure I'd call that the main objective of Hezbollah at the [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=583.4000000000001s)]
*  moment. Clearly, that's something that it will see as important. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=586.24s)]
*  And that is necessary if it is to carry on the fight in the [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=590.8000000000001s)]
*  future. But for now, it's basically waging, continuing to [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=594.0400000000001s)]
*  wage this war in continuation of the position it's taken over the [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=599.24s)]
*  last year, which is linking the Lebanese front with the conflict [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=603.36s)]
*  in Gaza, basically saying there will be a ceasefire in Lebanon if [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=607.6s)]
*  there's a ceasefire in Gaza. And it's not clear that at this point [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=611.96s)]
*  Israel would be satisfied even if Hezbollah accepted a delinkage [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=616.44s)]
*  and a return to the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=621.84s)]
*  of 2006, which would see Hezbollah withdrawal from the border area. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=626.9200000000001s)]
*  Israel probably aims for much more than that now. Nonetheless, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=631.28s)]
*  for now, I think Hezbollah is still pursuing that linkage. And [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=634.84s)]
*  that means that it's set itself up for more blows and more [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=638.12s)]
*  attrition. But it may be that it calculates in terms of its future [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=642.6s)]
*  interests, that it's [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=647.12s)]
*  okay, this is boring. I thought that they would I thought that [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=648.72s)]

*  is clear to the Iranians and when they cross it, they pay [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=933.64s)]

*  Israel? Both but also a third thing that's even funnier, which [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=1163.6s)]
*  is just Russians, like not Jewish, just Russians, which is [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=1169.6799999999998s)]
*  why it's which is why it's really funny. Let's just say [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=1174.36s)]
*  Israel, not a very white nation, like by the standards of your [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=1178.28s)]
*  eyeballs. I'm not using whiteness as a socio political [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=1182.28s)]
*  concept here. I'm saying like white as in like, I would be [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=1186.36s)]
*  white, you know what I mean? Like pale skin. But it still [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=1188.72s)]
*  tries. It tries to white itself. Some of those some of those [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=1192.48s)]
*  initiatives yield results such as this one. So anyway, this is [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=1197.88s)]
*  why it's really funny when Israel ends up blowing up position [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=1202.92s)]
*  in Syria that is a little too close to a base that Russian [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=1208.08s)]
*  soldiers are operating out of. And then Russia turns around and [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=1213.8s)]
*  you guys need to leave Israel. When Russia says you guys need to [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=1217.52s)]
*  leave Israel. That means, like, Israel is going to have a massive [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=1221.44s)]
*  population exodus. They're not going to leave anyway. But I [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=1226.72s)]
*  suspect that it's a mistake that Israel will never repeat again. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=1229.56s)]
*  Many Russian oligarchs have Israeli citizenship and are [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=1232.72s)]

*  ethnic Russians. And it reminded me of how Russia certainly [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=1255.1200000000001s)]
*  didn't do that in eastern Ukraine. The only thing stopping [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=1259.2s)]
*  Russia from attacking Israel right now is the fact that one [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=1262.48s)]
*  they have, you know, decent relationships. And also on top of [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=1265.48s)]

*  Yeah, no, I did know that. Yes. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2018.72s)]
*  War goes on. Amal is effectively aligned now with Hezbollah. The [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2021.6399999999999s)]

*  Lebanon and like Maria, parts of Beirut ordered to evacuate. So [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2040.96s)]
*  what will you do? We can't go to another place. There is just a [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2045.32s)]
*  year. So now we are waiting if we die or survive. We were in [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2050.0s)]
*  Mesa Jabal in the South and came to Beirut to our house in Dahi. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2055.36s)]
*  When the strikes took place in Dahi, we came to this school [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2059.96s)]

*  residents of more villages and towns in southern Lebanon to [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2078.32s)]

*  the land near the border is already deserted with hundreds of [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2085.8s)]
*  thousands of people fleeing their homes in fear that Israel's [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2088.4s)]
*  ground invasion could be expanding. Our foreign affairs correspondent [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2092.04s)]
*  Sukunda Kamani is in the southern city of Tyre where the streets are [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2095.6s)]

*  incoming and outgoing fire throughout the day. We can't really [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2103.64s)]
*  get any closer to the border, partly because Hezbollah have told [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2107.64s)]
*  us that we're not allowed to do that, partly also because the [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2112.36s)]
*  Israeli army has warned that any cars travelling from north to south [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2115.8799999999997s)]
*  in the region could be targeted. So it's hard to build up an [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2119.6s)]
*  independent picture of what's happening in terms of Israel's [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2122.6s)]
*  ground incursion into southern Lebanon and Hezbollah's fight back [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2126.44s)]

*  today was struck by an Israeli strike, that four paramedics were [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2133.96s)]
*  wounded and that one Lebanese government army soldier was killed. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2139.44s)]
*  The World Health Organization has also said today that 28 on-duty [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2144.52s)]
*  medics have been killed in the past 24 hours, all of this I think [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2148.92s)]
*  underlining just how dangerous the situation is. Across southern [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2152.64s)]
*  Lebanon, the sights and sounds of war as the number of killed and [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2157.04s)]
*  injured by Israeli strikes rises. Hezbollah have sustained devastating [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2162.0s)]
*  blows, but they're still the dominant presence here and they're [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2167.08s)]
*  controlling what we can film. Hussein Jashi is one of the group's [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2171.08s)]
*  members of parliament. Many people here in Lebanon are very angry [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2177.36s)]
*  about what Israel is doing, but many are also angry with Hezbollah [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2181.44s)]
*  for, they say, dragging the country into a war they did not want. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2185.68s)]
*  How would you respond? [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2190.7599999999998s)]
*  Everyone is entitled to express their opinion. We respect that, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2194.6s)]
*  but we are committed to our duty, to our homeland above anything else. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2198.56s)]
*  Is there anything short of a ceasefire in Gaza that would lead [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2205.2799999999997s)]
*  Hezbollah to stop firing on northern Israel because Hezbollah, [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2208.84s)]
*  this whole country, is paying a very high price for this war? [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2212.84s)]
*  The Zionist regime is the one that has dragged Lebanon into this war. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2217.6s)]
*  We ask the Zionists to stop their massacres on us and the people of Gaza. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2221.7999999999997s)]
*  The city of Tyre at the site of yet another airstrike. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2225.52s)]
*  When you look around at the scale of the destruction here, [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2231.04s)]
*  you get a sense of just how powerful the explosions must have been. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2233.7599999999998s)]
*  These were two buildings that are now just reduced to this huge pile of rubble. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2237.84s)]
*  That's from the Guardian article targeting paramedics. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2244.52s)]
*  Paramedics say they began to notice a pattern with the strikes. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2248.08s)]
*  Whenever they arrived at a location to start rescue operations, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2250.64s)]
*  they said Israeli airstrikes would follow. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2252.96s)]
*  They're double tapping specifically to hit paramedics. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2255.0s)]
*  He's not saying Zionist regime, he's saying Zionist enemy. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2260.16s)]
*  Why don't they translate right with the Arabic? I don't know. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2264.08s)]
*  Personal possessions, children's toys strewn amongst the debris. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2267.6s)]
*  Israel accuses Hezbollah of hiding its fighters and weapons amongst the population. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2271.32s)]
*  Hussain's wife and daughter were amongst those killed here. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2276.7200000000003s)]
*  There are no explosives or rockets here, he says. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2282.28s)]
*  But we are used to this. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2286.6000000000004s)]
*  Our blood, our bodies, our children are all for Sayed Hassan, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2288.2400000000002s)]
*  referring to the slain Hezbollah leader. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2292.28s)]
*  Hezbollah is firmly enmeshed into all aspects of life here, [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2294.92s)]
*  running a state within a state. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2299.4s)]
*  It even has its own civil defence team. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2302.36s)]
*  Seven of its members were killed in Beirut overnight. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2305.32s)]
*  You believe that your teams are being deliberately targeted? [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2309.32s)]
*  They're deliberately targeting us. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2312.0s)]
*  I've seen it with my own eyes. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2315.92s)]
*  Maybe they hit us by accident once, [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2317.28s)]
*  but we've had 30 colleagues killed in the past week. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2319.1600000000003s)]
*  They can't all be a mistake. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2321.88s)]
*  We're only getting a glimpse into this conflict, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2323.5600000000004s)]
*  but even amidst competing narratives, the suffering is clear to see. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2326.5600000000004s)]
*  Well, as you were saying, Chris, a little earlier, [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2333.4s)]
*  there are more than 20 towns and villages today [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2336.44s)]
*  worn to evacuate by the Israeli army. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2339.44s)]
*  That brings the total to around 70 towns and villages [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2342.44s)]
*  that have been given such orders. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2346.44s)]
*  And what's significant about the ones that were given out today [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2348.04s)]
*  is that some of these areas are to the north of where we are right now [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2351.6400000000003s)]
*  and tied to the north of the Litani River. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2355.44s)]
*  So that's deeper into Lebanon than the area Israel had previously [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2357.6400000000003s)]
*  been talking about pushing Hezbollah out from. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2362.6400000000003s)]
*  And that's going to strengthen fears about the possible eventual scale [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2365.04s)]
*  of Israel's offensive here. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2369.04s)]
*  So come to Kamani. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2371.04s)]
*  Now, today, of course, is Rosh Hashanah, [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2372.04s)]
*  one of the biggest Jewish holidays of the year, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2374.04s)]
*  so there are few people in Israel giving television interviews. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2376.04s)]
*  But from here in Lebanon, joining me now is the Minister for the Economy, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2380.04s)]
*  Amin Salam. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2384.04s)]
*  Thank you very much for joining us tonight. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2385.04s)]
*  This economy was already in such trouble. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2388.04s)]
*  What is the impact of this war? [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2391.04s)]
*  Good evening. Thank you for having me. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2393.12s)]
*  Definitely the impact of the war on the economy is devastating. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2395.12s)]
*  Everybody knows very well that prior to the beginning of this war, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2399.12s)]
*  Lebanon was already struggling for almost three years [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2404.12s)]
*  with a collapse in the economy, [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2408.12s)]
*  loss of the value of the Lebanese national currency, [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2410.12s)]
*  unemployment, social issues. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2416.12s)]
*  I mean, the country has been struggling for a while, [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2419.12s)]
*  but it's not over yet. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2422.2s)]
*  We're talking about the war. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2423.2s)]
*  The war came to add yet another layer of challenge to Lebanon. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2425.2s)]
*  Now we're talking about over a million displaced people, [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2429.2s)]
*  not to mention the million and a half million or 700,000 Syrian refugees [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2433.2s)]
*  that are still in Lebanon. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2439.2s)]
*  All that has really piled up to turn this nation into crisis mode. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2442.2s)]
*  Today, the GDP is in terrible shape. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2447.2s)]
*  The broadcasters channel for Chad. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2451.2799999999997s)]
*  Because hundreds of thousands of people lost employment over the past year. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2454.2799999999997s)]
*  Most of them are youth working power in the South [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2459.2799999999997s)]
*  and the agricultural sector in major industries [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2464.2799999999997s)]
*  in the Bekaa Valley in the South and parts of Beirut. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2468.2799999999997s)]
*  So let that alone. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2472.2799999999997s)]
*  We're not talking yet about losing entirely the tourism season, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2475.2799999999997s)]
*  which was a very major economic support to Lebanon the past three years, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2479.36s)]
*  given that it was one of the few remaining sectors pumping cash into the economy. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2486.36s)]
*  So now we're not talking anymore about growth. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2492.36s)]
*  We're not talking about GDP getting better. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2495.36s)]
*  We're talking about a big emergency cost on Lebanon [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2498.36s)]
*  that is going to last, and we don't see the end of it yet. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2502.36s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, Minister, so many people, as you say, are displaced [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2505.36s)]
*  they're not working, they have no income. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2508.44s)]
*  At what point are people going to start running out of money to eat? [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2510.44s)]
*  Well, the good thing is that the government had in place, [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2514.44s)]
*  I mean, given the fact that we've been functioning in emergency mode [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2517.44s)]
*  for many years before the war started. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2521.44s)]
*  So thank God we are good on the food security level, [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2524.44s)]
*  on the medical aid level. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2528.44s)]
*  That's how we're keeping the people surviving now. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2530.44s)]
*  But the biggest challenge now is if we don't reach an immediate [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2533.44s)]
*  and I say immediate ceasefire with serious stocks for peace, [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2536.52s)]
*  the long, you know, this war tending for longer or expanding further [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2541.52s)]
*  will get Lebanon into a very critical place. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2548.52s)]
*  It will get the economy into a point of no return. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2551.52s)]
*  That is where people will begin really facing serious challenges [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2554.52s)]
*  having income, having cash. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2559.52s)]
*  They will probably be spending everything they have left [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2561.52s)]
*  in the next few months if they are living in the streets [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2564.6s)]
*  and are having no jobs. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2567.6s)]
*  Right, but when you talk about ceasefire, [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2569.6s)]
*  the Lebanese army was drawn into the war today, [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2571.6s)]
*  returning fire against Israeli troops in the south [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2574.6s)]
*  and you have lost soldiers to that war already. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2577.6s)]
*  I mean, you're being drawn in, aren't you? [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2580.6s)]
*  Well, I mean, I said a few days ago, [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2583.6s)]
*  it's a full-fledged war against Lebanon. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2586.6s)]
*  I mean, the Israeli side is saying that [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2589.6s)]
*  we're targeting Hezbollah, we're not targeting Lebanon, [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2592.68s)]
*  we're not fighting the Lebanese people [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2595.68s)]
*  while they're bombing the city. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2597.68s)]
*  I mean, I'm talking to you now from less than a mile away [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2599.68s)]
*  from where the explosions had happened last night [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2602.68s)]
*  and that is even two miles less from the governmental palace. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2605.68s)]
*  So drawing the Lebanese army in is very dangerous, [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2609.68s)]
*  is very critical. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2613.68s)]
*  Expansion of that might take us to somewhere [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2615.68s)]
*  where we don't want to go. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2619.68s)]
*  As a nation. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2621.7599999999998s)]
*  So... [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2622.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm reminded of Kharkiv, an area, an area in Ukraine [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2623.7599999999998s)]
*  that had a lot of ethnic Russians [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2629.7599999999998s)]
*  or people who were Russian-adjacent [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2633.7599999999998s)]
*  and what the attitude of the people of Kharkiv [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2636.7599999999998s)]
*  was after Russia invaded Ukraine. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2640.7599999999998s)]
*  The reality of the matter is, [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2643.7599999999998s)]
*  there is no bombing people into liking you campaign. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2645.7599999999998s)]
*  That's not how it works, okay? [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2649.84s)]
*  You don't bomb people into being like, [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2652.84s)]
*  oh, well, I love these guys. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2654.84s)]
*  I love these guys now. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2656.84s)]
*  Thank you for bombing me. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2657.84s)]
*  That's not how it works. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2658.84s)]
*  It is the same exact idiotic principle behind [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2660.84s)]
*  what the Americans said about going into Iraq. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2665.84s)]
*  They will welcome us as liberators. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2672.84s)]
*  The hearts and minds of the people of Kharkiv [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2674.84s)]
*  will welcome us as liberators. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2677.92s)]
*  The hearts and minds campaign. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2679.92s)]
*  That is to also say that like, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2681.92s)]
*  the allegiances that some in Lebanon might have had for Israel [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2683.92s)]
*  is nowhere near as significant even to begin with. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2688.92s)]
*  Right, but when you talk about ceasefire, [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2692.92s)]
*  I'm sorry to interrupt, [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2695.92s)]
*  but when you talk about ceasefire, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2697.92s)]
*  isn't the fact that Hezbollah has said [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2699.92s)]
*  they are not prepared to ceasefire [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2701.92s)]
*  without a ceasefire in Gaza? [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2703.92s)]
*  This message today was very clear from our Prime Minister, [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2706.0s)]
*  Minister of Foreign Affairs, [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2710.0s)]
*  after their meeting as well with the Speaker of the House, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2712.0s)]
*  President Barry, [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2717.0s)]
*  that the entire government with all its political parties, [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2719.0s)]
*  Hezbollah included, are in favor of a ceasefire. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2722.0s)]
*  But the Israeli side is not helping with that [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2726.0s)]
*  because the Israeli side is not showing any intention [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2729.0s)]
*  to ceasefire, any flexibility. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2733.08s)]
*  It's just a continuous attack on Lebanon [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2736.08s)]
*  and on the people of Lebanon. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2739.08s)]
*  Mr. Salam, Minister for the Economy, [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2741.08s)]
*  thank you very much indeed for joining us. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2743.08s)]
*  Yeah, when Israel says they're just bombing Hezbollah, [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2745.08s)]
*  that isn't exactly meant for the Lebanese people, [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2748.08s)]
*  that's for Western ears to hear, exactly. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2750.08s)]
*  It's for Western ears to hear and analyze and think, [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2752.08s)]
*  oh, they're doing a great job. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z1Zk-cnPY4&t=2756.08s)]
