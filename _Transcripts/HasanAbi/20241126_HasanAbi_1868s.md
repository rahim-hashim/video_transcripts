# Hasan On CNN And The BEST 25 Streamers Right Now | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [November 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I)
*  Oh, what is that? Sheesh. They put me at number five. That's crazy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=0.0s)]
*  Put me in the top five. Glaze, Glaze. Oh my God. The photo is not the best, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  but what are you going to do? Hey, what are you going to do? What are you going to do? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  What are you going to do? I look like a cult leader. Don't go to top three. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=15.4s)]
*  If you want to keep your lunch in place. Wait, why? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=18.1s)]
*  But before we do that, let's cover the Donio Sullivan piece from CNN. Donio [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=21.4s)]
*  Sullivan showed up on the broadcast. Hey, the Macy's. Thank you for the playlist. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=32.1s)]
*  Donio Sullivan showed up at the Hassan Abbey compound and got brolic as heck. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=35.8s)]
*  Okay, we're going to be looking at the article slash story. It's going to be [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=42.099999999999994s)]
*  running on TV. Donio Sullivan is going to be running on TV as well, which is very [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=47.7s)]
*  exciting. Okay, but let's take a look. Let's take a look at what happened. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=53.0s)]
*  This is Hassan Piker. This is my dog, Kaya. I thought you legitimately were [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=58.0s)]
*  going to work out. I can do some weights. He's a social media superstar with [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=62.400000000000006s)]
*  almost 3 million followers on the video streaming platform Twitch. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=66.7s)]
*  They're eating. So this is that whole masculinity thing people are talking [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=72.5s)]
*  about, huh? And he's part of a growing group of streamers and podcasters [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=77.2s)]
*  reaching young men online, a space Trump tapped into to reach young male [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=81.5s)]
*  voters. If you punch in, then you won't be able to see that he's not doing [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=86.4s)]
*  any weights. But Hassan is not a Trump supporter. He's a progressive, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=89.5s)]
*  a fan of Bernie and AOC. The Democratic Party even invited him to the DNC [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=93.5s)]
*  in August. One thing we've been hearing for weeks now is that the left [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=98.7s)]
*  needs a Joe Rogan. Yeah, I don't think that the Democratic Party can podcast [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=103.7s)]
*  itself out of this issue. Joe Rogan endorsed Bernie Sanders in 2020. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=110.0s)]
*  Maybe they should do an autopsy on why he left the party. I like to work [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=114.9s)]
*  out. I'm very bro-y. A lot of people look at the optics of that and [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=118.60000000000001s)]
*  they don't like it. They think like, oh, well, he's a little toxic, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=122.4s)]
*  isn't he? And they don't really listen to what I have to say because [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=126.4s)]
*  I'm significantly more progressive than the average Democratic [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=129.4s)]
*  campaign. I've heard you say when it comes to stuff that guys like, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=134.5s)]
*  you seek that stuff out online, whether it's watching a stream or [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=139.3s)]
*  whether it's watching guys talking about working out and fitness, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=142.20000000000002s)]
*  you say that the right wing just dominates that space. Yeah. Why? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=145.9s)]
*  Well, I think that's why I started on Twitch, right? I know for a [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=150.6s)]
*  fact that the video game space is like people who consume this [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=154.9s)]
*  culture, people who are a part of this culture are not all right wing. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=160.4s)]
*  I wanted to showcase to people that like, no, you can be a progressive [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=163.4s)]
*  person. You can be a leftist and like have fun at the same time. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=166.3s)]
*  How many people are watching your live stream on election night? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=170.0s)]
*  The total unique number was 7.5 million. There's a general sense [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=173.3s)]
*  that when it comes to the world of podcasts, alternative media, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=177.9s)]
*  I don't even know what you want to call it, that Trump did a much [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  better job with us than Democrats and Harris. Absolutely. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=184.4s)]
*  I think that's true. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=188.70000000000002s)]
*  I was a naysayer early when I saw the Aiden Ross collab. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=190.5s)]
*  I thought this is not, this doesn't have motion. So this is Trump [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=193.5s)]
*  with Aiden Ross. When Trump went on Aiden Ross' stream, I was like, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=196.5s)]
*  it was awkward. It was weird. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=199.5s)]
*  But then I saw Trump on Theo Vaughn and he started talking about [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=204.0s)]
*  cocaine and I was like, uh-oh, this, this humanizes him. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=207.5s)]
*  Oh yeah. Up? Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=214.4s)]
*  So you're way up with cocaine more than anything else you can think of. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=217.4s)]
*  Cocaine will turn you into a damn owl, homie. You know what I'm saying? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=220.70000000000002s)]
*  It'll. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=223.20000000000002s)]
*  Harris did consider going on Joe Rogan. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=223.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=226.0s)]
*  But she didn't. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=226.8s)]
*  So that was a mistake as well, I think, because Joe Rogan can't [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=228.20000000000002s)]
*  deliver adversarial interviews if his life depended on it. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=235.6s)]
*  What is this that the Democrat Party has to do differently? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=239.5s)]
*  Well, I think that they need to change their policies. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=243.79999999999998s)]
*  It's a policy thing. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=249.0s)]
*  Yes, it's 100% policy thing. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=250.0s)]
*  Because I was like, right, which is the boring answer. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=252.4s)]
*  Although it would be very self-serving for me to say, I'm the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=254.4s)]
*  left's Joe Rogan. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=257.6s)]
*  The Democratic Party should give me millions of dollars. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=259.0s)]
*  That's not going to solve this problem. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=262.2s)]
*  What will solve this problem is if the Democratic Party actually [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=264.3s)]
*  adopts real left-wing economic populist messaging instead of [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=267.0s)]
*  purposefully avoiding that stuff because they're terrified of [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=272.8s)]
*  upsetting their corporate donors. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=276.3s)]
*  I think Trump speaks to male insecurities better and I think Trump [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=278.3s)]
*  speaks to the anger that people have, whereas the other side of [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=280.90000000000003s)]
*  the political spectrum does not speak to that anger at all. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=285.5s)]
*  There's been a lot of controversy around you. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=288.90000000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=291.8s)]
*  The way you talk about Israel is viewed by some as anti-Semitic. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=292.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=296.3s)]
*  Are you anti-Semitic? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=297.3s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=298.7s)]
*  The real problem here is that I'm extremely critical of Israel and [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=300.09999999999997s)]
*  all of the information that's readily available, especially on [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=305.79999999999995s)]
*  social media for so many people that don't necessarily rely on [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=309.0s)]
*  mainstream media any longer to get their information. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=313.09999999999997s)]
*  And that's why you see this generational gap. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=316.29999999999995s)]
*  If you're over the age of 35, you're still operating on the old [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=318.09999999999997s)]
*  boundaries. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=321.4s)]
*  You're like, no, Israel is the most moral democracy in the Middle [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=321.79999999999995s)]
*  East, maybe in the world, right? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=324.7s)]
*  And I think that the major generational divide that is, I think, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=326.40000000000003s)]
*  in a very damaging way, feeding into the mistrust overall that [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=333.40000000000003s)]
*  people have with mainstream news in general is coming from that. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=336.90000000000003s)]
*  That's it. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=342.70000000000005s)]
*  So we did a much longer interview and I believe that Donnie is [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=343.5s)]
*  trying to get it longer, too short. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=353.5s)]
*  I'm sure that everybody could learn a lot from us on about the [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=355.6s)]
*  alt media landscape and his policies and his policies when he's [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=357.40000000000003s)]
*  engaged in a longer deeper discussion with someone like you [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=360.5s)]
*  without the exaggeration for effect stuff would love to get a [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=362.40000000000003s)]
*  longer version posted. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=365.3s)]
*  I'll talk to my colleagues. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=366.20000000000005s)]
*  He said, but I think that there is there is more there's more on [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=367.3s)]
*  that front. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=373.20000000000005s)]
*  I mean, we talked for like an hour and a half. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=374.20000000000005s)]
*  We talked we talked for an hour and a half, but like obviously [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=376.20000000000005s)]
*  CNN has, you know, time constraints. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=379.20000000000005s)]
*  They they make this like pre-produced they make this pre-produced [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=383.90000000000003s)]
*  stuff and then they try to, you know, slot it in. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=389.0s)]
*  But I think they did a decent job of like, you know, to the best [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=391.8s)]
*  of their ability just posting some of the best parts of it, I [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=396.7s)]
*  guess, but they're going to it's actually going to be on way. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=400.6s)]
*  What is this front page cnn.com? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=405.3s)]
*  Check more top stories. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=407.2s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=409.40000000000003s)]
*  Where is it like here somewhere on the cnn.com main page? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=410.20000000000005s)]
*  But yeah, frustrating to be sensitive or your words carry so [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=414.40000000000003s)]
*  much weight because you're educated. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=417.70000000000005s)]
*  No, I I don't I'm not frustrated by this at all guys. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=419.3s)]
*  Any kind of your you're crazy. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=423.3s)]
*  Any kind of like positive coverage of me on CNN is something [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=425.90000000000003s)]
*  that I never would have expected and I will never take that [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=428.6s)]
*  for granted. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=431.3s)]
*  I will always be appreciative. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=431.8s)]
*  It's not censorship. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=433.20000000000005s)]
*  They're just cutting it for time constraints. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=434.20000000000005s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=437.3s)]
*  What do you mean more time? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=438.0s)]

*  Both of these guys could have gone down like very different [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=1371.5s)]
*  paths. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=1376.2s)]

*  circles that they were around and and everything else really [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=1380.7s)]

*  versions of themselves. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=1388.5s)]
*  I think and and and instead instead they are just like very [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=1390.4s)]
*  good. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=1396.3000000000002s)]

*  fucking awesome. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=1400.0s)]
*  Like they went and they packaged themselves to get a rumble deal. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=1400.9s)]
*  They got the bag and they basically streamed like once on [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=1403.7s)]
*  rumble and got an insane amount of money and then never did [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=1406.4s)]
*  it again. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=1409.4s)]
*  And it's obviously like, you know, it's obviously that they [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=1410.2s)]
*  both have the correct mindset for this space. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXj6SkXO7I&t=1414.8000000000002s)]
