# Interview With America’s Youngest Congressman -  Maxwell Frost
**HasanAbi:** [April 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k)
*  I think most people are on that and then beyond that there's policy differences [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=0.0s)]
*  But most people are there but if you talk about you know any occupation stuff like that you put yourself in a tough position [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=4.26s)]
*  politically and that's why a lot of people don't talk about it and so [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=10.08s)]
*  Big money out of politics is really important for this issue for like a lot of different issues as well [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=13.74s)]
*  Yeah, all right, we'll be there [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=23.84s)]
*  What's going on nice to meet you is this where we're doing it [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=26.56s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, we're always live oh [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=48.32s)]
*  Yeah, I got the mic right here. Yeah, nice to meet you in person [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=51.04s)]
*  Oh [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=55.84s)]
*  Michael from Pennsylvania [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=67.84s)]
*  What I'm talking all these lips nice [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=76.68s)]
*  Wow [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=85.84s)]
*  Where's the best possible place where we can talk I can't hear myself [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=91.68s)]
*  Anyway, we can walk and talk. Yeah. Yeah, Congress person [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=110.48s)]
*  You're are you still the youngest I'm still the youngest. Yeah, 28 now [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=115.25999999999999s)]
*  Hopefully that changes though because if you're the youngest for too long, that's a problem because I'm getting older [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=119.74s)]
*  Yeah, so like what do you think about a lot of the young talent in the Democratic Party right now that are yeah coming out [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=123.84s)]
*  and [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=131.38s)]
*  Working to to working to [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=133.54s)]
*  Run for office. Yeah, I mean, I think we're gonna see the most like young people running for office. We've seen [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=136.5s)]
*  This cycle coming up and I think it's gonna be for Congress [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=143.70000000000002s)]
*  But it's also gonna be for a lot of local offices and just all different types of offices [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=146.66s)]
*  I mean obviously because of everything going on right now the fascist kind of takeover and billionaire takeover [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=150.3s)]
*  I think is activating a lot of young people [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=156.16s)]
*  But it's activating a lot of young people that are at the age where they've also been through a lot of also another other social [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=160.18s)]
*  movements and maybe they were old enough to run for office or push them to you know, go out and march up and think about things like [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=165.58s)]
*  George Floyd March for our lives like the older kind of Gen Z contingent, which I'm the oldest of we've been through all of those [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=173.22s)]
*  And now they're at a point where like movements like this now they can actually run for office [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=180.86s)]
*  They're old enough to run for office. They've been organizing long enough. So I think we're gonna see a lot of them [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=184.74s)]
*  Do you feel like at times the rest of your caucus? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=189.74s)]
*  might present hurdles in front of more radical elements coming from [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=194.14000000000001s)]
*  People that are out here people that are out on the streets in general [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=198.86s)]
*  Yeah, and it's the people but the institution itself is not [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=202.7s)]
*  Meant for people to come in and say everyone should have health care [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=207.85999999999999s)]
*  We should do something about the climate crisis like there's hella hurdles and honestly [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=210.94s)]
*  My biggest hurdle is financial like you have to raise money [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=216.29999999999998s)]
*  Then you have to have money to live and like one of the first things I did when I got in Congress is we pass [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=219.34s)]
*  Help pass this rule with the FEC where candidates can give themselves a better stipend [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=223.73999999999998s)]
*  Because you know I had to drive uber and I was homeless during my campaign for two months because I didn't have enough money to sustain [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=228.54000000000002s)]
*  myself and that shit we do we don't [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=234.54000000000002s)]
*  Count the number of candidates that drop out because they can't afford to continue like they can't afford their rent [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=237.70000000000002s)]
*  And so they have to stop. Yeah, so [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=242.38000000000002s)]
*  The institution itself is not set for anyone from the left any [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=244.62s)]
*  Progressives to make it in and then young progressives young working-class progresses for you know, it's even harder [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=248.18s)]
*  We still have to try but when we get in I think every progressive that wins an election [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=253.42000000000002s)]
*  Part of the things they have to focus on is changing the institution to make it easier for more progressives to get it [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=258.38s)]
*  Okay, some of the setbacks you said are the congressional. I mean the campaign stipends offered on any other [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=263.42s)]
*  Setbacks that you experience that you want to you want to work on fixing raising money [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=270.5s)]
*  I mean we really need to have publicly funded elections [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=275.54s)]
*  the fact that you have to raise money for these races automatically puts all working-class people at a disadvantage and [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=278.3s)]
*  In congressional races 98% of the people who win raised the most money [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=285.14000000000004s)]
*  So like we that's a huge thing then dark money. We have to end Citizens United and and super PACs [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=290.22s)]
*  I mean, that's a huge liability and I can tell you being in Congress [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=296.34000000000003s)]
*  There's times where I talk with colleagues who are like I want to vote this way on something [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=299.94s)]
*  But I'm worried about a primary and tons of money coming in leaks some names [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=303.38s)]
*  Who's who's it? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=309.02000000000004s)]
*  It's like a sentiment, you know what I mean? Yeah [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=311.5s)]
*  I mean one issue that I can think of is obviously Israel. This is like this is this is a major [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=314.78000000000003s)]
*  Major fissure amongst the Democratic base of support both pre-election and even post-election [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=321.54s)]
*  newest polls that came out from Pew show [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=327.58000000000004s)]
*  71% of all Democrats have an unfavorable opinion of Israel [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=331.54s)]
*  We had 80% demanding a ceasefire within the Democratic Party's base and the ceasefire numbers have been [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=335.48s)]
*  Consistent throughout the last like, you know since October 7th and so [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=342.54s)]
*  Yes [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=348.42s)]
*  The it is [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=349.42s)]
*  Israel-ballast is one of the issues where obviously we see the most money we saw what happened with my with Jamal and Corey [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=350.94s)]
*  Crypto is another one that's rising up that's matching that money. That's also concerning [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=357.46000000000004s)]
*  But here's the thing and this is why I think now even more moderate Democrats are gonna start speaking more about Citizens United [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=362.74s)]
*  Is now you have Elon saying well, I'm gonna target like anything more like centrist moderate Democrats to unfortunately people a lot of them [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=368.02s)]
*  Don't feel that [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=375.42s)]
*  energy or urgency until [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=376.78s)]
*  They're the one you know, and obviously like people have been taught trying to talk about this for a while [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=378.94s)]
*  What happened to Jamal what happened to Corey? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=383.32s)]
*  And so yeah, but you feel like it's the it's the fear that they might get primaries themselves that stops people from [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=385.82s)]
*  Yeah taking an active stance in this and oh yeah more people would have gone for a static fashion [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=394.09999999999997s)]
*  Yeah more and like [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=398.74s)]
*  Most of the country believe believe in a ceasefire most of the country [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=401.14s)]
*  I think is in a position of where we need to end occupation, right? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=405.21999999999997s)]
*  I think most people are on that and then beyond that there's policy differences [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=409.46s)]
*  But most people are there but if you talk about, you know, any occupation stuff like that you put yourself in a tough position [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=413.4s)]
*  politically and that's why a lot of people don't talk about it and so [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=419.1s)]
*  Big money out of politics is really important for this issue for like a lot of different issues as well [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=422.86s)]
*  I think ultimately what a lot of these people out here demand is that their representatives actually behave like public servants and fight for them [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=428.28s)]
*  Yeah, and one of the I feel like there's it's twofold [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=436.98s)]
*  You have the death take a position of leadership and actually move the national conversation [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=441.94s)]
*  in the direction of the [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=448.9s)]
*  Unjustifiable deportations regime the erosion of due process the erosion of the First Amendment at the behest of a foreign nation [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=451.7s)]
*  and I think [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=459.14s)]
*  All of those things a lot of these people will be on board with yeah [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=461.5s)]
*  But it's not broadly reflected at this moment from even the polls [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=466.09999999999997s)]
*  But even when it is reflected in the polls [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=470.46s)]
*  There's the secondary problem where the Democrats that say that they want to operate on David Shor's popularist [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=472.82s)]
*  Mentality but there's clearly a bunch of issues. Yeah, I would consider to be gimmies that they're not actually [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=480.09999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, yeah at all. Well, and the other thing is and I I've been [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=487.02s)]
*  I've been I've been telling a lot of people like you got to think critically about these polls [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=491.18s)]
*  Because after we lost the election a lot of Democrats were like knee-jerk reaction. Oh we immigration we went too far whatever [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=496.09999999999997s)]
*  That means trans rights who went too far on human rights. I know you go too far into human rights [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=503.58s)]
*  But here's the thing if you look into the numbers and you look at the ads actually viewed like [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=507.94s)]
*  Not every but a lot of the ads the right wing did they were never about [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=513.02s)]
*  Trans people they were never about immigrants because they were most of this country is fine with trans people [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=517.46s)]
*  Most of this country wants people to have their rights and be dignified and not be discriminated against whether you're trans person or not [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=522.26s)]
*  Most people know immigrants are born. Most people are against mass deportation [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=527.66s)]
*  Yeah undocumented people but what the right wing does is they find a vulnerability and they look at the numbers and try to see [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=531.62s)]
*  Okay, we know that most people don't want to be hurt. So that crimes are the ads on immigration weren't just about immigration [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=539.24s)]
*  It was about the most craven blood thirsty [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=546.18s)]
*  Undocumented immigrant you can find if you don't like Trump they're gonna come and kill you same thing with with trans people [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=549.54s)]
*  They honed in on trans kids in a very specific way [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=555.42s)]
*  And so I think the what Democrats have to do is not shy away [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=559.02s)]
*  But we have to be very forward and stand ten toes down and dominate the conversation [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=563.18s)]
*  Because if you leave it open, they will take advantage of it. We did it to them on abortion and guns [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=568.1s)]
*  So we can't allow that to happen [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=572.9399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. I mean, this is what I've been screaming about from the rooftops even before the selection and it's not an impurpatutity [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=575.42s)]
*  It does it does feel like a lot of Democrats at least like older Democrats that have calcified in their [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=583.34s)]
*  positions of comfort and their positions their ideological positions [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=590.3000000000001s)]
*  Refuse to tackle any of these issues head-on and are too terrified of counter messaging on anything [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=594.46s)]
*  That's the problem leadership and one of the things that the Republicans did I mean they they know their positions are unpopular [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=599.0400000000001s)]
*  But they still actively push for it and dominate the media landscape [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=607.7s)]
*  And it's not just about appearing on podcasts. It's a multifaceted approach [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=612.98s)]
*  where the people the [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=617.9000000000001s)]
*  Representatives themselves are reflecting what the that they want the base to have [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=620.46s)]
*  Whereas in this in this situation, we have popular mobilization happening in one direction [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=625.58s)]
*  Yep, but the Democratic Party is not responsive to the demands being made [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=631.82s)]
*  Even as simple even if the demand is simple as fight back fight back against this administration [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=636.94s)]
*  I will say I'm I'm seeing at least where I work [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=642.02s)]
*  I'm seeing a big like a shift going on in part because of this and these rallies happening very close to a lot of [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=644.58s)]
*  Congressional districts and I think that shift is really important [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=651.0600000000001s)]
*  We saw what happened to see our vote [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=654.1800000000001s)]
*  Obviously the Senate messed this up [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=655.1s)]
*  But I'm not sure what we would have been that strong if it wasn't for these mobilizations going on [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=656.9s)]
*  So I'm 100% with you on it [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=662.1s)]
*  I mean a lot of people are learning all the wrong lessons from this last election and I part of the purpose of these rallies [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=663.94s)]
*  I think to is that get people engaged but also make sure people know these issues I [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=670.4599999999999s)]
*  Find the the word like the center so interesting because everyone has a different definition of what the center is [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=675.66s)]
*  Is it what most people believe or what's most likely to get done in the institution right now? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=681.14s)]
*  Because medical for all is the center like most people are for it, right? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=686.14s)]
*  The ceasefire is the center was a center. And so this is the where does the moral center of politics? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=690.9s)]
*  So I feel like we got a lean and if we don't we're gonna lose more we're gonna lose worse [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=698.2199999999999s)]
*  One one last thing. Yeah that I want to bring up in terms of the trans issue or in terms of getting bullied on this [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=702.86s)]
*  Sort of stuff on immigration [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=710.1s)]
*  Beyond counter messaging. I think the Democrats are not [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=711.9399999999999s)]
*  Identifiable on tangible policy prescriptions to the problems that American people are facing. Mm-hmm. What would you say are? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=716.66s)]
*  Three top policy positions that would identify you who though identify me. Yeah. Well a big one [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=724.62s)]
*  I have to bring up is and specific policy positions. I would say [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=730.78s)]
*  Like banning assault weapons, you know generally around gun violence [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=735.7s)]
*  Gun violence is what got me involved in politics when I was 15 because of Sandy Hook shooting and then we had pulse nightclub [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=739.86s)]
*  Like where I live and three months after that I survived gun violence in downtown, Orlando [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=745.5s)]
*  So the reason I was bring up gun violence is it's the symptom of other issues [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=749.6s)]
*  Like housing and so I would say that the other one is fixing the housing crisis [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=753.94s)]
*  I really need better tenant protections and national [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=759.2s)]
*  rent freeze or [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=763.46s)]
*  Rent control I think is really necessary [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=765.58s)]
*  Housing is the number one issue I hear about from people when I knock doors [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=768.42s)]
*  Yeah, like because whether you're a tenor or a homeowner you're pissed off right now on the housing situation [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=771.38s)]
*  And then I'd say the third one would be [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=777.26s)]
*  Medicare for all I mean and and just getting everyone health care [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=781.0s)]
*  I think that would be one of the most transformational things to happen in this country in terms of like lifting everybody else [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=785.1999999999999s)]
*  But we know like just a million things we need to do [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=791.36s)]
*  Yeah, no, they're a lot I'd say those three really like identify with my story and why I came to this work. Okay. All right [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=793.8399999999999s)]
*  Thanks a lot. Yep. Good to see man. Nice to meet you [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=800.0799999999999s)]
*  All right [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=802.5999999999999s)]
*  I think all right. Hey, what's up? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=805.5999999999999s)]
*  You [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQyZZXyPE3k&t=810.04s)]
