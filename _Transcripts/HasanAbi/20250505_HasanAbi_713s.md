# Gym Is My Peace | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig)
*  That is precisely what I'm doing here. This is, you know, giving you access into the inside [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=0.0s)]
*  of the mind of a San Hasanami piker and being able to do so without risk of injury is the is the best [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=5.76s)]
*  part. So actual results from this year's NFL combine show that the max this year was 32 reps [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=11.44s)]
*  and the big boys got 20 to 30 reps at 225 pounds. You got no friends. Sad. Yeah. The cookies on the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  other hand did help me lift because I hit 10 for two plates finally and it's been a while since I've [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=29.12s)]
*  hit 10 for two plates. It's been quite a while a couple of years as a matter of fact because like [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  after I started lifting again post, you know, peak of COVID I started lifting again. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=40.8s)]
*  Bro, look at how quick look at how I'm ripping that by the way. This is 225 pounds, baby. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  But the last one is bad. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=53.6s)]
*  So that's nine. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=61.52s)]
*  I still made it looking awfully thick in the neck. Yeah, I got a thick neck. Can I say I love this [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=67.68s)]
*  purple moment? Thank you. You're able to throw the out of a bowling ball. Yeah, got a reptile failure. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=73.44s)]
*  Anyway, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen. My point is two 25. I used to be able to do at [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=79.2s)]
*  my peak. I was able to do it for 15. Like that's NFL combine. Like 225 pounds for 15 reps is NFL [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=85.44s)]
*  combine level. Okay. And back in my peak physique, when I was like 24, 25, 26, I could do that. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=95.04s)]
*  That, but since, I mean, not, I didn't say good NFL combine. Okay. Chatters are comparing me to [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=101.04s)]
*  like the monsters that put up like 35. Okay. You're, I didn't say I would be top level in [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=109.04s)]
*  the NFL combine. I would say that if you can rep two 25 for 15, you are NFL combine level. Okay. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  You're the kicker. No, no. It puts you 15 reps for 225 pounds. I would play. I would say, I don't know. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=125.2s)]
*  I actually don't know. I legitimately don't know, but I think it's like average, right? Isn't that [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=135.6s)]
*  like the average NFL combine? Like that's an average NFL player can hit 15 reps on 225 pounds. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=141.84s)]
*  And you have to remember when we say average on the other end of the spectrum, like you have the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=149.2s)]
*  kickers on the one end of the spectrum. And then on the other end of the spectrum, you have monsters [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=153.44s)]
*  like people that do not belong to this planet. People that actually fell onto earth, like from [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=157.76s)]
*  a galaxy far, far away as like a, like a crystal meteorite or something. And then, and then [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=164.0s)]
*  developed into monstrous beasts that can do 40 in a row 15, 24 defensive backend and receivers, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=170.16s)]
*  20 to 25 for running backs, 25 to 34 tight ends and linebackers 30 to 39 for linemen. I don't, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=178.08s)]
*  you're telling me that every single running back in the NFL can easily rep 20 to 25 [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=185.84s)]
*  for 225 pounds. I feel like that's a little crazy. They have to, they should be able to. That's crazy. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=194.0s)]
*  I did not know that anyway. I'm weak. The point is I'm weak. I'm weak. I'm a weak man. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=201.36s)]
*  I am a weak man. Okay. We already know that, but I'm getting stronger. And that's what's important. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=209.12s)]
*  The story, the moral of the story is this. I haven't been able to get the barbell bench press [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=215.52s)]
*  up for even 135 pounds without injury for the longest time. And at this stage, I can literally [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=222.72s)]
*  do 225 pounds for 10. Finally back at like the 10 level again. And 10 is an important one because [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=231.28s)]
*  like that means I can, that means I can go up more and more. Anyway, I'm happy about this. This is [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=239.92s)]
*  another milestone. Sometimes even hitting a previous milestone that you had set for yourself, that you [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=246.16s)]
*  had easily done for a long time in your life, but you could not achieve for a year because of a deep [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=252.88s)]
*  cut that you engaged with being able to get back to that milestone is still good and should be [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=260.64s)]
*  celebrated. That is precisely what I'm doing here. This is, you know, giving you access into the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=265.84s)]
*  inside of the mind of a son, Hasanami piker, and being able to do so without risk of injuries is [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=271.03999999999996s)]
*  the best part. So actual results from this year's NFL combine show to the max this year was 32 reps [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=277.44s)]
*  and the big boys got 20 to 30 reps at two 25 pounds. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=282.48s)]
*  Okay. I don't think chatters were wrong. 15 puts you in like mid tier literally or bottom, bottom [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  tier, not even mid tier. You got to do 20. That's crazy. I think 20 is more accurate to say mid [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=309.2s)]
*  tier for the combine chatters were right. I was wrong, but I don't know enough about sports. So [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=315.36s)]
*  that makes sense. Also, I can't believe we're comparing the very fact that the very fact that [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=319.12s)]
*  I'm talking about the combine in and of itself is crazy because I mean, these are literally the top, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=327.52s)]
*  top 1% of 1% of 1% of 1% athletes on the planet. And I'm not an athlete. I am not a professional [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=336.0s)]
*  athlete. I lift not even for strength training, but specifically for with hypermobility that I [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=343.03999999999996s)]
*  already have that already makes it a problem for me to do these kinds of compound muscle exercises. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=351.44s)]
*  But I'm a professional yapper. I'm the top 1% of 1% of 1% of yapping. Okay. I do NFL numbers [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=357.35999999999996s)]
*  on, on the gift of gab. Okay. And also I'm like 10 years older than every single person there, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=363.84000000000003s)]
*  which doesn't actually mean anything. Cause like, that means if I had 10 years, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=371.2s)]
*  if I had 10 full years of like actively weightlifting, I would be able to, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=376.08000000000004s)]
*  I'd be able to outlive these guys, especially if I like [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=381.92s)]
*  did it right up until the age of 35, it actually benefits you like being young is good for recovery [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=386.08000000000004s)]
*  and stuff. But weightlifting time actually does help in terms of, in terms of strength, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=392.24s)]
*  in terms of putting on strength, time is actually a benefit in that regard. No, literally, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=398.32s)]
*  I don't know why people are saying cope on, I'm saying time would help me normally, but in this [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=403.84000000000003s)]
*  situation, I haven't worked out appropriately. I'm saying that time would not be a time in this [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=408.0s)]
*  situation is not a negative. It's a positive guys. There's only a finite amount of muscle mass that [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=413.6s)]
*  you can put on your body in, in like a year long period. A lot of the stuff is, I mean, your body [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=420.56s)]
*  is a complicated machine. You need to get comfortable with certain weights that you're [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=428.8s)]
*  putting up. You need to be able to like, there's a, there's a neural connectivity with your muscles, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=433.28000000000003s)]
*  like, like a movement that you've done so many times that it becomes like easier and easier to do. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=439.28s)]
*  That's why sometimes when you're weightlifting and you move on from novice level to like a higher [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=444.32s)]
*  level of expertise, people will say, you know, it's good to sometimes get under and spend some [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=448.88s)]
*  time under heavier weights in order to develop confidence under heavier weights. That's why it's [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=456.71999999999997s)]
*  much easier for someone like myself after I quit weightlifting during COVID to go back into it and [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=461.36s)]
*  be able to very quickly engage in recomp and, and see much faster returns than someone who is just [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=467.28s)]
*  starting out. All of this is to say, I will be watching the Jeff Nippard video. Of course, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=475.04s)]
*  obviously this is a fun, this is a fun way to introduce that. We'll watch that later though, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=480.8s)]
*  not right now, but yeah, obviously I'll be watching how much muscle did I gain in 365 days. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=485.36s)]
*  Jeff Nippard unironically did this, did this thing where he basically showed like you have to do [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=491.04s)]
*  steroids after a certain level. Then I know that that's not his takeaway and that's not what he [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=496.96000000000004s)]
*  wanted people to take away from that. But I know the end point and I realized like, oh, so it's [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=502.88s)]
*  like it literally, you do peak like for sure. Like it's very, it's clearly, it's clearly, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=508.15999999999997s)]
*  no, he gained muscle. No, I know, I know, I know, I know he did, but you have to understand what he [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=514.96s)]
*  did to gain that muscle. Like, like we are, if we're, if we're talking about humanity, if we're [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=521.2s)]
*  talking about humanity and the imperfect nature, the imperfect nature of man and, you know, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=528.88s)]
*  entertaining certain things like, like he achieved this, he achieved this level of muscle mass [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=536.4s)]
*  at his peak physique without steroids by eating perfectly. Like not a moment is wasted in the [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=544.72s)]
*  process. That is impossible. Okay. That is like 365 days of, of unimaginable feats of, of resistance, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=553.04s)]
*  resilience, strength. The more you train, the harder it is to gain. Sometimes you're lucky to [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=565.52s)]
*  put five pounds on a rep max. And when you're exactly, once you get to a certain level, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=570.4s)]
*  unless you get like a little bit of medical boosting, it's just not going to, it's not going [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=575.5999999999999s)]
*  to push you far, but you're not close to your peak. Right. And ho no, no, no, I'm not. Jeff is [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=579.68s)]
*  one of the only people that I know that is a public person persona, like a public person [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=586.0799999999999s)]
*  that has actually achieved a natural physique that almost is like, like where you basically get to [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=592.4799999999999s)]
*  your peak. Like that's it. This is you, your body has pretty much reached its limit. I am nowhere [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=598.2399999999999s)]
*  near my limit. Are you crazy? I'm talking to a man with like probably 16% body fat right now. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=604.8s)]
*  That's wild. Have you seen the one guy who was trained only one side of his neck? Yeah, I did. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=609.76s)]
*  People need to stop. I don't even want to look at it. It freaks me out. Anyway, Hassan Abiy heads [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=614.7199999999999s)]
*  were doing water drop LA and took Taylor Lorenz out on water drop. Hell yeah. Shouts out as pretty [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=620.88s)]
*  fire Hassan Abiy heads rise up. But yeah, anyway, personal news wise, like I said, weightlifting in [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=626.4799999999999s)]
*  the morning was pretty good. And it was exciting. Jim bros Hassan Abiy Jim bros or something else. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=633.28s)]
*  What is this? We did not leave Iraq because we were Chinese. We left because we were no longer [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=638.3199999999999s)]
*  safe. I saw this. Didn't even need to pre today. Just needed a 40 year old man baby to piss me off [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=641.68s)]
*  enough to hit multiple PRs. Because in the pan Arabic nationalists that arise out of you are out [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=647.8399999999999s)]
*  of your mind about Palestinians. Okay, so what did the Jews in Iraq have to do with Israel? You, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=655.36s)]
*  you bigot. Anyway, Hassan Abiy Jim bros rise up. I usually just picture Bill Maher. I'm [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=661.04s)]
*  interestingly enough, I'm not an angry lifter. I don't, I don't get angry at all. I'm very calm [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=669.36s)]
*  when I'm lifting. It's my moment of Zen throughout the day. It's like my one moment of, of solace. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=673.92s)]
*  One, my one moment of comfort. Thank you to Macy's for the playlist. And I actually don't [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=679.76s)]
*  like, I feel at peace when I'm at the gym. Anyway. All right. We got a lot to talk about, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=684.16s)]
*  obviously, Israel announces its plans for final solution in Gaza. It's official. They're doing it [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=689.6s)]
*  or they say that they're doing it. Who these strike is. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLyT7efB5Ig&t=701.52s)]
