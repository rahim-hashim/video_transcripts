# Jon Stewart On CNN’s Biden Cancer Book Bombshell | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o)
*  There is no surprise here, like, oh my God, I can't believe Biden was so old, a reality that virtually every American was aware of. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=0.0s)]
*  This is only breaking news to members of the media that I guess bludgeoned their heads silly until they couldn't see Biden as a belligerent old man. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=8.64s)]
*  John Stewart made some funny jokes about this. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=19.0s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=26.32s)]
*  What a program we have designed for you tonight. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=30.04s)]
*  A bespoke artisanal effort that I think you are going to truly look at. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=36.8s)]
*  Patrick McGee is going to be here. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=40.36s)]
*  He is the they call him McGee heads. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=41.84s)]
*  That's the fandom, the Patrick McGee fandom here to discuss his new book about how Apple's actions in China shifted the entire global economy. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=44.32s)]
*  The book is phenomenal. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=54.88s)]
*  For a book about Apple, it's banana. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=57.28s)]
*  That's a little, it's a fruit pun. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=59.96s)]
*  It's 20th, that's Tuesday. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=63.2s)]
*  Original sin, that's Ukraine. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=64.72s)]
*  Whether somebody can stop Netanyahu, somebody please. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=66.52000000000001s)]
*  It's not whether Taylor's unfriended Blake, I don't know. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  No, like most people in America, I am most looking forward [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=74.88s)]
*  to reading a book, but when? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=79.68s)]
*  When? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=81.48s)]
*  We're back with breaking news in our politics lead and a brand new [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=83.84s)]
*  excerpt from my upcoming book with Axios's Alex Thompson. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=86.56s)]
*  It's called Original Sin. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=89.6s)]
*  I'm not sure if you've heard of it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=90.6s)]
*  It's on Biden's decline. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  It's called Original Sin. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=92.64s)]
*  I'm sure you've heard on May 20th, that's Tuesday. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=93.8s)]
*  Original Sin, that's coming out in three weeks. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=96.0s)]
*  On May 20th, that's just 19 days. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=98.52s)]
*  God damn, bro, he's farming his book so goddamn hard. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=100.28s)]
*  It's so, it's so funny that it is so fucking funny [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=103.84s)]
*  that Biden came out and was like, I got cancer. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=110.12s)]
*  Like right before he released a book, finally, I think it's like [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=113.32s)]
*  coming out tomorrow or something, which makes this fucking hilarious [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=116.44s)]
*  because now all the libs that we're going to read this book and be [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=120.75999999999999s)]
*  like, oh, I can't believe how old Biden was now. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=124.24s)]
*  Hate Jake Tapper and are like Jake Tapper, you are enemy. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=127.39999999999999s)]
*  Number one persona non grata, you piece of shit. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=131.0s)]
*  And this forces Jake Tapper's hand into, oh, it's today. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=134.28s)]
*  Oh, sorry. The book dropped today. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  Now this forces Jake Tapper's hand to do the ass tapping that we love [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=140.48s)]
*  him for against Joe Biden. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=145.64s)]
*  One last time, even before the June debate, 86% of Americans thought [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=149.0s)]
*  President Biden should not run a second term, including 73% of Democrats. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=151.88s)]
*  So if there's a scandal here, it is simply one of political hubris. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=155.32s)]
*  The Democratic establishment who told themselves they are saving democracy, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=157.88s)]
*  but undercut that message, instead cooking on CNN. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=160.8s)]
*  Let's watch this first and then. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=164.8s)]
*  I said, what's what's your take on it all? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=166.92s)]
*  Just the news or just the reaction or whatever? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=170.36s)]
*  I mean, I think that the reporting we have known, which is that President [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  Biden in the eyes of the American people was clearly unfit to run for another four years. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=176.04000000000002s)]
*  I was looking up some of the stats and ABC poll in February 2024 before that debate. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=180.96s)]
*  I mean, there was a poll in 2022 as well, but that goes behind that goes. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=184.72s)]
*  That is before that is before Jake Tapper started calling him old. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=188.92000000000002s)]
*  So obviously that's. You know, 86% of Americans thought Joe Biden should be running again. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=193.72s)]
*  73% of Democrats thought he shouldn't be in the race. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=199.04s)]
*  And I think even that's before that's before the debate. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=202.04s)]
*  Even you go back to 2020, I remember being on the trail and people having concerns [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=204.35999999999999s)]
*  about Biden's age then. That's why he made the implications about being a bridge [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=207.44s)]
*  to the next generation. That's why he implied possibly that he would think about only [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=210.79999999999998s)]
*  serving one term because it was necessary for him to win the presidency the first time. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=214.48s)]
*  And so now, yes, boy, cause CNN, some bitch on Casey Hunt's show just said Biden's [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=218.12s)]
*  legacy would be tarnished by the book's discoveries. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=224.48s)]
*  Tank Jake Tapper and Alex Tams, Tom's book. Do not buy the damn thing. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=227.16s)]
*  Yes, blue mega. Oh my God, they want to do BDS. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=232.8s)]
*  They want to BDS Jake Tapper. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=237.88s)]
*  How do we've come to this point? I think what the book does well as layout, how much [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=239.56s)]
*  of an insider choice it was. And I love that for me, it just underscores how many of [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=242.72s)]
*  these public servants did not have the public in mind at all. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=246.8s)]
*  They decided amongst themselves that Joe Biden deserved another four years and then [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=249.96s)]
*  decided that their political incentives meant the whole party fell in line. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=254.64s)]
*  And so that, I think, is a real scandal, a political establishment, a political [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=258.36s)]
*  insiders and really putting deference and tradition above their job. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=262.36s)]
*  And so, like, that's the takeaway I really have. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=267.08s)]
*  It's sad for Joe Biden and his legacy. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=269.24s)]
*  It's sad for a Democratic Party who I think really torpedoed a lot of their trust [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=271.15999999999997s)]
*  with their base voters. Honestly, I think it's sad for America because there was an [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=275.0s)]
*  election that should have been. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=278.88s)]
*  What do you think of then Hamas killing the protesters in Gaza, like Odeh Nazer [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=279.88s)]
*  Al-Rabbi was tortured and killed by Hamas militants in late March 2025 after [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=284.48s)]
*  public criticizing group participating process? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=287.8s)]
*  Yeah, that's really tough. You know what should happen? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=289.92s)]
*  The j**** side should end. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=292.68s)]
*  You know what's really tough? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=294.08000000000004s)]
*  Outside of that, the wholesale slaughter of every Palestinian man, woman and child [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=296.36s)]
*  and the purposeful blockade of aid going into the Gaza Strip in a deliberate effort [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=303.40000000000003s)]
*  to ethnically cleanse the Gaza Strip of the two million Palestinian population, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=310.08s)]
*  dropping the metric ton equivalent of five atom bombs on the world's largest open [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=316.08s)]
*  air prison. I think that, you know, two things can be right at the same time, right? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=323.52s)]
*  Do you think that like you think that Israel's j**** side is going to put an end to [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=329.56s)]
*  things such as this? Is that what you think? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=334.52s)]
*  Are you are you jealous that like Hamas got to kill this one guy instead of an American [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=337.15999999999997s)]
*  weapon that was shipped off to Israel expeditiously? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=342.47999999999996s)]
*  Is that what's going on? Is that why you brought it up? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=345.68s)]
*  I agree. I don't support Israel either. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=348.4s)]
*  I just seem like Hamas is not on the side of Palestinians either. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=350.12s)]
*  Hamas is the only game in town that's actually the Israeli occupying force. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=352.68s)]
*  So you are wrong. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=357.32s)]
*  Like, think about it. Israel is displaced millions, every single person in the Gaza [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=359.15999999999997s)]
*  Strip and killed so much more. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=364.28000000000003s)]
*  And you're like this one guy that Hamas killed, according to reports that I'm seeing, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=368.0s)]
*  is actually the true evil here. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=373.12s)]
*  Like, what are you crazy? Are you insane? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=375.04s)]
*  Are you on crack? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=377.04s)]
*  Yeah, great. Dissolve Hamas. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=378.36s)]
*  OK, dissolve Hamas as a political entity and allow the Palestinians to democratically [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=380.68s)]
*  elect who they want to elect. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=385.6s)]
*  It's killing protesters. How is that helping Palestinians? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=387.16s)]
*  Brother, do you not understand what I'm saying? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=389.48s)]
*  Do you not understand what I'm saying? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=392.04s)]
*  I don't care. I don't care about who governs Gaza. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=393.64s)]
*  I want the Palestinians to have sovereignty. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=396.15999999999997s)]
*  Hello. Listen to my words. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=399.52s)]
*  Listen to my words. Who is a greater, who is a greater, greater hurdle [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=401.8s)]
*  for the Palestinians getting sovereignty? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=406.84s)]
*  Is it Hamas or is it Israel? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=408.8s)]
*  It's Israel, by the way. The answer is Israel. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=411.44s)]
*  You're a moron if you say it's Hamas. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=413.28s)]
*  Wow, what a brilliant point you brought up. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=415.03999999999996s)]
*  I can't believe Hamas killed a protester. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=416.8s)]
*  Both are cancer to Palestinians. No, no, they're not. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=418.91999999999996s)]
*  Shut the f*** up. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=421.24s)]
*  Hey, hey, I know. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=422.20000000000005s)]
*  Look, I'm not a fan of Israel. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=423.64000000000004s)]
*  They've killed a lot of people. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=425.40000000000003s)]
*  But I'll have you consider Hamas killed a protester and it's really tough. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=427.6s)]
*  It's like, yeah, it is. OK, it is. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=431.84000000000003s)]
*  You're right. Those people should be criminally charged after the apartheid ends, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=433.84000000000003s)]
*  after the occupation ends. How about that? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=437.92s)]
*  You want to do that? No, you don't. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=439.92s)]
*  You just want to keep chirping. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=441.52000000000004s)]
*  This argument did not make sense during the Al Ahly hospital bombing [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=443.84000000000003s)]
*  when Israel defenders were like Israel would never bomb a hospital. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=448.16s)]

*  But it all but even if it was literally a misfired [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=454.24s)]
*  Palestinian Islamic Jihad rocket, which it wasn't OK, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=457.88s)]
*  that was just a lie that Israel told. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=460.8s)]
*  But even if that was the case, like, what is the argument there? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=462.40000000000003s)]
*  Like only Israel gets to kill Palestinians? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=465.16s)]
*  Is that the argument? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=467.16s)]
*  Excuse me. I'm really jealous that [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=468.96000000000004s)]
*  that Palestinian Islamic Jihad potentially killed these Palestinians [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=472.2s)]
*  when Israel should have killed them. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=475.36s)]
*  Is that the argument you're making? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=476.64s)]
*  Like, what are you talking about? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=478.44s)]
*  There is no way that you could both sides a campaign. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=480.04s)]
*  Like, there's just not a thing you can do. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=482.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, it reminds me of the ones who say, you know, you would get killed [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=485.0s)]

*  You would be killed for being straight in Gaza, too, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=494.36s)]

*  It's such a shit argument. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=499.88s)]
*  It's such a stupid argument. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=502.0s)]

*  What are you saying? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=506.40000000000003s)]

*  But it's like, wait, hold on, I need to I need more information [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=511.84s)]
*  about the Jews that were sent to the concentration camps [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=516.4s)]
*  and what their political allegiances look like before I can make up my mind [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=519.52s)]
*  about the ethics of the ass argument, you know, hold on now. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=524.12s)]
*  Or some of the Jews sent to the concentration camps or the gas chamber [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=528.1999999999999s)]
*  where they know if they were, then maybe it was all right. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=531.12s)]

*  Like, what the fuck kind of stupid argument is this? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=535.36s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=538.24s)]
*  Terrorists are bad to everyone and Hamas are terrorists is a simple point. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=539.28s)]
*  You have no argument against it. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=542.24s)]
*  No, I do. I have a mountain of arguments against it. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=543.72s)]
*  You want to know what those arguments are? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=546.48s)]
*  It's that Israel, by that same metric that declares Hamas, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=548.36s)]
*  a terrorist organization, is such a super terrorist organization [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=551.64s)]
*  that you can't even call them the same thing, because I use [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=555.28s)]
*  these words very carefully and there is no response to it from Israel defenders [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=559.08s)]
*  who try to say, oh, Israel is bad, but Hamas is worse. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=562.9200000000001s)]
*  That's not true. OK. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=565.96s)]
*  Israel is far worse than Hamas. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=568.24s)]
*  Israel is a far larger terrorist entity than Hamas. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=571.4399999999999s)]
*  Israel is Nazi Germany in this circumstance. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=575.48s)]
*  And Hamas would be the brave resistance force against Nazi [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=579.12s)]
*  Germany in this circumstance, whatever form that that might take. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=583.0s)]
*  Their own political convictions or their own domestic affairs [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=587.56s)]
*  play no role in whether or not Palestinians are worthy of genocide. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=591.84s)]
*  You are a fucking freak for saying this, but you don't understand it [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=596.3199999999999s)]
*  because the terrorism designation is a convenient one that you can slap on [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=600.24s)]
*  to just be like, oh, my God, sorry, I hadn't realized this is all Germany. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=604.1999999999999s)]
*  What? Yeah, it is all Germany. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=608.8399999999999s)]
*  It's Nazi Germany. Israel is Nazi Germany. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=610.8399999999999s)]
*  It is exactly like Nazi Germany. OK. Yeah. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=613.04s)]
*  Point to one fucking resistance group that has not executed collaborators, dude. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=617.3199999999999s)]
*  Oh, I don't know. Maybe the apartheid should have continued in South Africa. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=622.72s)]
*  After all, the ANC was executing in heinous ways collaborators of apartheid [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=626.12s)]
*  South Africa. So maybe the apartheid should continue. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=631.64s)]
*  Is that it? Is that the argument? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=634.4s)]
*  I don't know. The Warsaw ghetto uprising, they fought the Nazis, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=637.12s)]
*  but they also fought like some civilian casualties also died in the process. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=640.8s)]
*  So I guess, you know, maybe the Holocaust is valid. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=645.0s)]
*  Is that your argument? No, of course not. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=648.0s)]
*  You'd be a fucking moron to say that. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=649.8s)]
*  Oh, the Nat Turner rebellion was incredibly bloody. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=651.96s)]
*  They killed children. They killed babies in their fucking crib. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=654.68s)]
*  So I guess chattel slavery as a practice should continue. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=657.1999999999999s)]
*  No, of course not. Right. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=660.12s)]
*  So why the fuck do you make that calculation here? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=662.4799999999999s)]
*  It's because you don't see the Palestinians as human beings. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=665.4399999999999s)]
*  That's why. Like everything that you try to say about Hamas [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=667.64s)]
*  is a million times worse for Israel. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=670.8s)]
*  Hamas also steals food and aid for the Palestinians. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=673.8s)]
*  One, that's not true. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=675.9599999999999s)]
*  But even if it was, Israel is denying aid and food into the fucking strip. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=677.0799999999999s)]
*  Also, Hamas are Palestinians. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=681.56s)]
*  They're not like an alien organization. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=682.9599999999999s)]
*  They didn't like get beamed into fucking the Gaza Strip. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=684.52s)]
*  They're fucking comprised of orphaned Palestinians [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=687.12s)]
*  that Israel killed in previous incursions. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=690.0s)]
*  What the fuck? What is this? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=693.12s)]
*  What is this argument? What is this argument? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=695.24s)]
*  Dude, I'm here to learn. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=697.4399999999999s)]
*  Don't talk to that. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=698.4s)]
*  Don't talk in that tone as I'm some fucking geopolitical guru. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=699.3199999999999s)]
*  Then don't fucking assume such an asinine, idiotic stance [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=702.3199999999999s)]
*  as though you are knowledgeable Hamas because they steal food and aid. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=706.84s)]
*  Israel doesn't allow food and aid. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=710.1999999999999s)]
*  Hamas doesn't even steal food and aid. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=711.88s)]
*  You have no fucking evidence for this. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=713.32s)]
*  As a matter of fact, Hamas or at least the governing body of Hamas, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=715.4000000000001s)]
*  the Civil Governance Affairs of Hamas, the internal police force, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=718.88s)]
*  unironically actually made sure that aid was distributed. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=721.96s)]
*  And it even matter. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=724.6800000000001s)]
*  Israel killed the people that were doing that. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=725.4000000000001s)]
*  Hamas actually executes the the thugs that the Israeli occupying force [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=727.6s)]
*  arms and allows to operate that do actually steal the aid. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=732.88s)]
*  You know who fucking executes those guys? Hamas does. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=736.32s)]
*  Are you going to fucking complain about that? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=738.48s)]
*  The people that are stealing the aid, Hamas executes [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=739.96s)]
*  with the limited capabilities that they have as Israel is doing a 24 7 [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=742.4399999999999s)]
*  surveillance campaign and mass bombing in the fucking strip. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=745.8s)]
*  Hamas killed babies, you say. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=748.4399999999999s)]
*  That one, I can't even fucking begin to explain. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=751.36s)]
*  If you think that, like if you think that Hamas is a far worse baby [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=754.88s)]
*  killing machine, you are delusional. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=759.28s)]
*  OK, Israel has killed what? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=762.0s)]
*  At this point, 10,000, 20,000 times more children [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=764.56s)]
*  than than Hamas did. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=768.8s)]
*  Like, what is the number of children that Israel has killed? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=770.56s)]
*  Like, I think there was one there was one child, like the under the age of 18. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=773.16s)]
*  I think there was like four on October 7, which is a horrible, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=777.36s)]
*  horrible fucking crime, OK? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=781.16s)]
*  Not even sure if that was a byproduct of the Hannibal directive [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=783.96s)]
*  before we even talk about that, considering that Israel also literally [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=787.64s)]
*  unleashed helicopter fire on the Nova Festival survivors [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=791.12s)]
*  that were trying to escape. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=795.52s)]
*  That's number one. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=796.96s)]
*  And number two, the the children that were killed were killed in the kibbutzim. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=798.12s)]
*  And guess how they were killed in the kibbutzim, Israeli tank fire. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=803.16s)]
*  So the idea that like those deaths are directly attributed to the [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=807.44s)]
*  to Hamas militancy is also, you know, we don't know. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=811.48s)]
*  We don't know if that's the case or not. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=815.2s)]
*  This isn't to say that Hamas didn't kill civilians. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=816.6s)]
*  They certainly did. It's on camera. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=818.48s)]

*  I don't think that's appropriate in any way, shape or form. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=822.2s)]
*  Meanwhile, having said that, Israel has killed 18000 children. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=825.4000000000001s)]
*  What the fuck are you talking about? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=830.6800000000001s)]
*  I think it was about 36 under the age of 18, one of them being an infant. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=832.76s)]
*  Yeah, there was one. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=835.9200000000001s)]
*  They just released 5000 pages of dead Palestinian names, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=837.12s)]
*  and the first 18 pages were babies under the age of one. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=839.84s)]
*  So having dead and alive hostages is OK because Israel kills them so badly. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=842.6800000000001s)]
*  One must ask the question, if you care about the if you care about the hostages, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=846.5200000000001s)]
*  because like clearly you don't care about Palestinians, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=849.84s)]
*  you only care about Jews in this situation. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=851.36s)]
*  Palestinians are not human. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=853.1999999999999s)]
*  Jews are the only people that you entertain as human beings, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=854.52s)]
*  which, by the way, is a dynamic that also Hamas and every Palestinian understands, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=857.88s)]
*  which is precisely the way that the reason why they took fucking hostages to begin with. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=861.76s)]
*  OK, even though it is illegal to do so, and I understand that. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=865.4s)]
*  But it turns out Israel doesn't even care about Israeli Jews [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=870.0799999999999s)]
*  because they killed most of the fucking hostages that died. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=873.88s)]
*  So what are we talking about? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=876.76s)]
*  They sometimes directly shot them because they mistook them for a Hamas. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=878.64s)]
*  Sometimes they blew up buildings where the hostages were inside of said building. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=883.8s)]
*  Do with that information what you will. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=887.68s)]
*  Israel is still starving its own Israeli Jewish hostages [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=889.48s)]
*  that are in the hands of Hamas by starving the entirety of the Gaza Strip. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=893.0799999999999s)]
*  So when you are faced with that reality, why do you fucking turn around and go, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=898.56s)]
*  dude, I'm not political geopolitical guru. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=902.64s)]
*  OK, then know your fucking place. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=904.9599999999999s)]
*  The word Takuara was part of the name of the Argentine [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=906.7199999999999s)]
*  fascist movement, Movimiento Nacionalista, the Takuara Nationalist Movement. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=909.28s)]
*  Nice. Good argument, though, chatter. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=914.92s)]
*  What happened? Cool. Thanks. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=917.28s)]
*  You little Nazi freak days away in one week and one day. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=919.64s)]

*  Comes out Tuesday. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=925.24s)]
*  You will not believe what we found out. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=926.64s)]
*  Don't news people [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=929.64s)]
*  have to tell you what they know? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=932.76s)]
*  When they find it out, isn't that the difference [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=936.4399999999999s)]
*  between news and a secret? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=939.12s)]
*  You won't believe what we found out. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=942.12s)]
*  No, that's why I'm watching breaking news. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=943.84s)]
*  You know, now, I don't know how the rest of the country is feeling [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=946.96s)]
*  about this book coming out, but I know New York to be fair, to be fair, to be fair. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=950.12s)]
*  It's not like this is breaking news. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=954.64s)]
*  Like breaking news, water is wet. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=957.72s)]
*  You can't wait to read all about it in my upcoming book. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=961.44s)]
*  Water is wet. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=964.8s)]
*  You know, there is no surprise. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=966.8s)]
*  There is no surprise here. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=968.84s)]
*  Like, oh, my God, I can't believe Biden was so old. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=970.1600000000001s)]
*  A reality that virtually every American was aware of. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=972.8000000000001s)]
*  This is only breaking news to members of the media that, I guess, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=977.52s)]
*  bludgeoned their heads silly until they they couldn't see Biden as a as a [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=980.6800000000001s)]
*  belligerent old man. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=986.2800000000001s)]
*  Every time I say water is wet, water isn't wet, though. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=987.8000000000001s)]
*  Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=990.36s)]
*  Oh, my science ass motherfuckers. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=992.64s)]
*  New York City, baby. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=998.84s)]
*  The city. The city that never stops reading. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1014.24s)]
*  That's our motto. Our motto is [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1026.4s)]
*  we're going to make a new book about the [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1029.28s)]
*  Frick Museum. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1033.5s)]
*  And I'm kidding, of course, that is footage from the reopening of the Frick Museum. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1034.52s)]
*  By the way, it is New York. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1044.1599999999999s)]
*  So, you know, the real name of the museum is the collection. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1045.04s)]
*  You just put it up there like, hey, the Friggin collection. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1049.36s)]
*  What are we doing? [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1051.84s)]
*  So what is this bombshell book about? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1053.1599999999999s)]
*  A new book is outlining new claims about former President Biden's physical [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1057.2s)]
*  and mental health. The book Original Sin claims Biden's health had become so severe [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1061.12s)]
*  that there were internal discussions about putting the president in a wheelchair. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1066.28s)]
*  He allegedly was napping during debate preparations. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1070.0s)]
*  Another bombshell. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1073.32s)]
*  Former President Biden apparently forgot the name of his longtime aide, Jake Sullivan, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1074.12s)]
*  and called him Steve. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1077.76s)]
*  My God. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1079.32s)]
*  To be fair, when you forget a white guy's name, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1083.04s)]
*  to be fair, and I say this with respect to the bombshell, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1094.6399999999999s)]
*  Steve, it's not a bad guess. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1102.24s)]
*  I think even Jake Sullivan at some point was like, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1109.3999999999999s)]
*  is my name Steve? [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1113.12s)]
*  Because when I look in the mirror, I could be Steve. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1116.96s)]
*  Or Scott, maybe a Craig. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1122.0s)]
*  The point is, the American news media were hungry for more. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1125.76s)]
*  A new Biden bombshell. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1131.68s)]
*  Dropping bombshell allegations. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1133.3999999999999s)]
*  A steady drip of new revelation. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1135.52s)]
*  Yeah, he showed you all respect to Biden, by the way, for coming out on top. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1137.1599999999999s)]
*  And hitting the ultimate button, the I have cancer, so I bet you're going to feel stupid [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1142.6399999999999s)]
*  now, but the more I see how much the media hyped up this fucking book that is supposed [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1148.32s)]
*  to be this bombshell revelation, which is Biden is old. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1153.48s)]
*  OK, he was very old. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1158.32s)]
*  Bombshell revelation, Hassan, I'll be a Twitter account. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1162.24s)]
*  Twenty nineteen. Biden is very old. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1165.32s)]
*  How could he have foreseen this? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1167.8s)]
*  Oh, my God. A bombshell revelation that 75% of Americans were aware of in 2022. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1169.6s)]
*  Damning claims. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1179.08s)]
*  Damaging new details. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1180.1599999999999s)]
*  Oh, my goodness. They're dripping with details. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1181.28s)]
*  A massive tsunami. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1183.12s)]
*  The drip drip on Joe Biden's decline. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1184.4799999999998s)]
*  My God, Fox News built an entire Biden sucks border wall. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1190.1999999999998s)]
*  To hold back the raging drips of details in bombshells, nothing could slow down this [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1194.28s)]
*  coming feeding news frenzy about Biden's cognitive health, other than maybe a report [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1199.48s)]
*  on his actual physical health, which was not good. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1205.56s)]
*  But now we got ourselves a little problem. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1209.08s)]
*  You've prepared an entire smorgasbord. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1212.96s)]
*  Smorgasbord. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1216.92s)]
*  Charcuterie board. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1219.8799999999999s)]
*  Charcuterie board. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1221.52s)]
*  You know, I mean, geez, you know, entire smorgasbord based on what you thought [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1231.16s)]
*  would be a relatively uncomplicated story about mental decline. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1238.12s)]
*  News has the countdown clock. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1243.28s)]
*  They got the book graphics. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1245.16s)]
*  They got the CNN Happy Meal tie in toys. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1246.32s)]
*  Happy Meal tie in toys. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1249.48s)]
*  But now doing the story seems almost disrespectful. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1254.16s)]
*  Can CNN thread the needle? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1260.64s)]
*  How do you pivot from excitedly promoting your anchor's book to somberly and respectfully [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1263.3600000000001s)]
*  promoting your anchor's book? [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1271.72s)]
*  Biden's health was very much in the news even before the cancer diagnosis was announced [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1273.8s)]
*  on Sunday. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1278.04s)]
*  That's because of a new book by CNN's Jake Tapper. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1278.64s)]
*  This was already going to be a tough week and this makes it much harder. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1280.92s)]
*  And that is a reference to the fact that our colleague, Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1284.96s)]
*  have a book that's set to publish on Tuesday. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1290.76s)]
*  This very tough news, this very challenging news. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1293.8000000000002s)]
*  And at the same time, the backdrop of our colleague Jake Tapper's book with Alex Thompson [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1296.88s)]
*  coming out this week. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1300.92s)]
*  It's so hard. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1309.0400000000002s)]
*  It's such a difficult time, so unfathomable in terms of the pain this family must be feeling. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1309.76s)]
*  And yet, if you act now and you use the code backslash, tap that book, you will. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1317.8400000000001s)]
*  Obviously, this 20% off offer is not available for some reason in Tennessee. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1338.96s)]
*  But the point is, forgetting about the fact how weird it is that the news is selling you [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1346.0800000000002s)]
*  a news they should have told you was news a year ago for free. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1354.0400000000002s)]
*  It's just fun to watch them not only continue to push the book in light of this difficult [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1362.0800000000002s)]
*  news, but to actually frame this difficult news as perhaps even more of a reason to buy this book. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1365.68s)]
*  The timing of former President Joe Biden's cancer diagnosis is certainly dramatic. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1372.24s)]
*  Coming on the eve of a blockbuster new book about his health and his time in the White House. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1377.28s)]
*  Go on. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1383.0800000000002s)]
*  I'm sure some observers will say that the reporting in the book is even more important now. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1385.3600000000001s)]
*  Yet nobody's saying that. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1390.44s)]
*  No observers will say it's more important now. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1391.92s)]
*  Some observers might think, do these CNN people work on commission? [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1394.12s)]
*  Why are they hawking this thing? [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1400.36s)]
*  Is this a Girl Scout cookie situation? [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1402.4399999999998s)]
*  Whoever sells the most Tapper book. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1405.7199999999998s)]
*  Jake Tapper fucking controls CNN like the goddamn Navy, dude. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1408.36s)]
*  Like the fact that all of these other anchors are like constantly pumping the book is so crazy. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1414.76s)]
*  I guess partially because like Tapper is one of the most important commentators on CNN, which again, [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1420.0s)]
*  not a great look for CNN, but also Tapper, Jake Tapper controls the media. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1428.04s)]
*  No, just CNN. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1433.32s)]
*  But also, I guess that way they get to like defend their coverage over Biden or their [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1435.6399999999999s)]
*  lack of coverage over Biden's senility when it was very obvious. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1441.76s)]
*  ... gets a Schwinn. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1446.44s)]
*  That is not necessarily the model they will get. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1450.2s)]
*  I don't want to disincentivize people from working hard, obviously. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1453.04s)]
*  I don't go through all the graphics before the show. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1458.3200000000002s)]
*  While CNN had to shift from somber and caring to always be closing, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1460.44s)]
*  Fox and the rest of the right wing media had a very different problem. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1467.76s)]
*  How to shift from let's go, Brandon, to get well, Brandon. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1472.12s)]
*  And then as quickly as possible back to let's go, Brandon. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1477.36s)]
*  Watch them work their magic and see how much weight the word butt carries. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1480.2399999999998s)]
*  It's a terrible thing for him and his family. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1485.84s)]
*  So I hope he beats it. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1487.4399999999998s)]
*  But look, I hope he beats it. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1489.8s)]
*  But not too fast. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1492.8799999999999s)]
*  You want to enjoy this. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1496.28s)]
*  But what? [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1499.28s)]
*  But look, I don't believe that they just found out Friday, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1500.84s)]
*  because they're not credible on anything they've done. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1505.1599999999999s)]
*  So true. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1508.32s)]
*  Yeah, I'll bet. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1510.44s)]
*  I'll bet he didn't find out Friday. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1511.56s)]
*  I bet he found out like Wednesday. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1514.36s)]
*  And then they were all like, oh, my God, this terrible. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1515.8799999999999s)]
*  Should we tell this guy? [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1517.6399999999999s)]
*  And then they're like, I don't know. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1518.8799999999999s)]
*  Why don't we tell the family first? [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1520.8s)]
*  And then they're like, yeah, I really want to know. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1522.08s)]
*  I got to tell you, I think this all really highlights an opening in the [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1525.08s)]
*  greeting card market. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1528.32s)]
*  We don't have enough cards that swing wildly from sympathy to accusation. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1530.16s)]
*  When is he going to fucking rip more into? [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1536.6s)]
*  I thought he was going to rip more into like Brandon to like, who gives a fuck [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1538.72s)]
*  to hear about? [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1543.16s)]
*  If this weren't you raising money for cancer last week or something, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1546.08s)]
*  what did you know exactly? [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1548.76s)]
*  I knew I knew Brandon. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1550.08s)]
*  OK, you want to know something? [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1552.04s)]
*  I'll come out and I'll admit it. OK, listen, listen. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1554.2s)]
*  Two weeks ago, I found out that Joseph, Robin and Brandon [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1558.48s)]
*  had a debilitating version of cancer, also commonly known as prostate cancer. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1563.48s)]
*  And when I found out that this was happening, I contacted Idubs, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1570.48s)]
*  who I knew was raising money for cancer. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1574.52s)]
*  I told them, Idubs, let's do a fundraiser for cancer this way. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1577.36s)]
*  I knew that as soon as I started fundraising for cancer, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1583.28s)]
*  my podcaster co-host, former podcast co-host, Ethan Klein, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1586.48s)]
*  would inevitably position himself against cancer. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1590.48s)]
*  He would join the side of cancer on the war against cancer. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1593.48s)]
*  This way, knowing full well that once the news would hit mainstream media, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1597.48s)]
*  that Biden had prostate cancer. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1603.0s)]
*  And I started talking about how I don't care that he has cancer, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1604.6s)]
*  especially considering that he's a war criminal responsible for many cancer [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1607.72s)]
*  wards being destroyed in the Gaza Strip. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1611.52s)]
*  He was destroyed in the Gaza Strip in the hands of Israel [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1614.84s)]
*  as he continued his death and destruction campaign gladly and willingly [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1617.84s)]
*  and wanted it to continue so bad that he actually gave up the administration [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1622.84s)]
*  to Donald Trump, a fascist that would continue Israel's genocide on the Gaza Strip. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1626.84s)]
*  I knew that Ethan Klein would turn around and now, all of a sudden, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1631.84s)]
*  take an inconsistent position after only two weeks prior, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1636.84s)]
*  taking a position that was objectively pro-cancer. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amHNozNhW8o&t=1641.84s)]
