# Recap Hasanabi's DebateLord | Hasanabi React
**HasanAbi:** [September 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk)
*  is so poggers. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=0.0s)]
*  I knew that was going to be awful for her because like she's also a boomer like me, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=10.56s)]
*  but even less tapped into like Twitch culture and gaming than me. And I knew that like, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=16.46s)]
*  have I hit her with some like, okay, you already know I got cream pieed like aggressively by [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=21.78s)]
*  every single person. I deserve it. I made a lot of people work. I put a lot of people [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=33.06s)]
*  to work and, and honestly, you know, they were, they were phenomenal, dude. Look, I've [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=37.260000000000005s)]
*  never put on a big show like this. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=44.38s)]
*  So obviously I was a little worried, right? Obviously I was a little worried. Like I was, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=48.1s)]
*  I was worried that people were not going to like it. I was worried that people were going [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=55.38s)]
*  to complain that there wasn't enough politics in it, that people were going to come in and [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=57.980000000000004s)]
*  be like, where's the politics you said you were going to debate. Cause there's always [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=60.980000000000004s)]
*  like those weirdos, right? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=63.980000000000004s)]
*  Not understanding that like there can be content beyond just like politics, like there is a [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=65.92s)]
*  world out there where politics is not the only form of content. Right? So I was a little [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=72.58000000000001s)]
*  worried about that for sure. And I think that ultimately it worked out really well. I was [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=78.14s)]
*  a little disappointed in Ludwig. He did apologize afterwards. Like he sent me a heartfelt apology [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=86.02000000000001s)]
*  afterwards, which was, you know, very adult of him. I was a little disappointed like what [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=91.34s)]
*  that if I hadn't asked him to send us, send me his location, like turn on his location, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=99.5s)]
*  we would not have even known that he wasn't going to make it to the show. Okay. And it [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=104.98s)]
*  was like, really it was, it was kind of because like, it's not just me, right? There are so [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=109.3s)]
*  many people who are basically putting their entire, like there, there are people who are [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=116.58s)]
*  putting their heart into this, right? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=122.26s)]
*  You have hundreds of people working on the production side when you put together a show [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=124.02s)]
*  like this. So it would have been really for them, but obviously Jason came in super clutch. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=128.1s)]
*  I, he already said like he Jason was supposed to be on the show with Ludwig, right? But [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=135.57999999999998s)]
*  he had told me that he couldn't make it right. He said he had other obligations, but then [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=142.38s)]
*  I think the day of the show, like literally that morning he hit me up and was like, Oh, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=147.7s)]
*  I can actually do it. I can actually do it. So I was like, all right, perfect. You know [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=151.78s)]
*  what? We'll figure out a way to make you be a part of the show. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=156.82s)]
*  And basically what ended up happening was, you know, I hit him up last second after Lud, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=162.38s)]
*  after Lud said, Oh, complex wrote a new article. Nice. After Lud said he wasn't, or after we [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=171.18s)]
*  found out that Lud was like literally three hours away, 30 minutes before the show, I [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=177.06s)]
*  last second and he was down to do it and it worked out perfectly. And he added a lot of [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=183.38s)]
*  humor. I think he was really funny here. I'm going to show you this while I go pee really [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=189.06s)]
*  quickly. Would you choose as your running mate and why you have 40 seconds running mates [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=193.62s)]
*  to be president? The president is the leader of the country. I know what that is. It's [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=198.7s)]
*  on, if I were to statistically calculate this in my head, sophisticatedly speaking, I'd probably [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=203.62s)]
*  pick Aaron Yeager. Let me get a point for that one. Elaborate. I mean, look at the end [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=209.9s)]
*  of the day, it's night and whenever at the end of the day, it's night climax reaches [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=216.86s)]
*  its peak. Aaron was a great leader. Some would say even the best. Okay. You're out of time, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=226.38s)]
*  Jason. That was horrible. Yeah. Jason has no public speakers. This has 108,000 likes, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=234.7s)]
*  bro. This has a million views over in like 20 hours. Yeah. Negative points. When you [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=240.54s)]
*  asked them which land he would nationalize, he said seaside would just so funny, but I [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=249.89999999999998s)]
*  don't think you got that. Yeah. I was his walkout. This walkout was amazing. Seeing [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=253.7s)]
*  for you. Oh, this was the test walkout. Wait, should I show things? Okay. I got a P I'll [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=259.94s)]
*  be back. Okay. Whoa. Wait, is there people here? Oh, this is crazy. Cinema. I don't know [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=267.86s)]
*  how that worked out so well. Cause like, right as I come out, feminine comes on. Oh, I'm [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=283.18s)]
*  like, I'm following. Wait, should I show things? Yeah. Okay. Whoa. Wait, is there people here? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=288.86s)]
*  Oh, this is crazy. I was definitely nervous. I was definitely nervous, dude. I'll be honest. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=297.3s)]
*  Like I've never done, I've never done a, like I've never, I've never done a show like this [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=314.78s)]
*  before. Like I've attended a lot of shows like this, right? I mean, I I've done it for [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=322.94s)]
*  Austin a million times over, right? But I've never done it on my own. So it was really, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=327.7s)]
*  it worried me quite a bit, but I think we got to the groove. We got into the groove [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=334.41999999999996s)]
*  things like we, we were able to figure it out, you know, here. Oh, it's right here. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=339.82s)]
*  I have it right here. And at first you could probably tell it was like a little nervous, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=346.18s)]
*  you know, but by the end of it, I was just super chill. I was, I was, you know, I was [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=351.5s)]
*  ready. I was locked in. I was cooking. I will use at the end of the day. It's night for [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=356.3s)]
*  decades in my personal life. It's brilliant. How to whose line is it anyways? Vibe. Yeah. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=360.62s)]
*  It was supposed to be like a combination. We worked a lot on all these different segments, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=365.26s)]
*  but it's good. It's good experience to have overall. I was working with people who like [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=371.53999999999996s)]
*  formerly worked with a daily show and two, by the way, like these were like legit comedy [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=374.94s)]
*  writers that were on staff putting the production side together. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=379.18s)]
*  And and you know, the Twitch rivals team that like does all of these big events. This was [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=384.34s)]
*  like a very creative thing for them to do. That wasn't like another Twitch rivals, right? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=388.42s)]
*  So they were very excited about that too. And the goal was the goal was to hopefully [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=393.78s)]
*  try and get you guys to laugh. And I think bro, seeing you do that content on Twitch [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=400.02s)]
*  with fans stream for, I never thought Twitch would allow you to do something like this. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=405.05999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, it was sick. It was definitely sick. I was, I was very, you know, I was very happy [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=407.73999999999995s)]
*  with the, I was very happy with the outcome. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=412.7s)]
*  Sear was hilarious. Caroline was hilarious. Nick was great. Bebe no money. Like all things [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=415.65999999999997s)]
*  considered. I mean, this is like, he was dropped into this, you know, he was parachuted into [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=423.06s)]
*  this content and he did a great job overall. Jason, obviously incredible. And you know, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=426.78s)]
*  the PowerPoint stuff, I hope you guys liked that. It was supposed to be hard. It was supposed [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=433.9s)]
*  to get them like, it was, I think, like, I think I'll say it like this. I think it got [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=438.62s)]
*  like funny when we opened up, like things opened up a lot when I did the cracker line. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=445.62s)]
*  And then from that, from that point on, I think it was like smooth sailing. Nondre was [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=452.1s)]
*  hilarious. Everything now show was great too. But yeah, this was, this was one of the highlights [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=456.58000000000004s)]
*  of the night. Yeah. Yeah. They, they also put him off like his auto tune, be no money's [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=462.62s)]
*  auto tune was like deliberately busted for the record. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=469.62s)]
*  Just so you guys know, that's why it sounded like that. And then Jason's was not busted. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=472.98s)]
*  So that's why he sounded the way he did. But I, but so this was supposed to be Ludwig [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=479.1s)]
*  versus a BB no money early on. Okay. This was supposed to be Ludwig versus BB no money. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=483.94s)]
*  And because Ludwig wasn't there, I had to like make a last second swap out. And I was [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=490.3s)]
*  like, I think Jason will do a great job because he's the depth guy guy, right? He was the, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=493.34000000000003s)]
*  he was Mr. Depth guy. So I was like, I'm going to make him sing. So I asked him in one of [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=497.86s)]
*  the breaks, I was like, bro, are you ready? Can you do this? And he was like, yeah, I'll [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=502.14000000000004s)]
*  do it. Why not? And he did. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=505.38s)]
*  Jason, the wean everybody. Number one artist on Spotify depth guy. Yeah. Are you trying [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=535.38s)]
*  to say depth guy or depth try? No, I'm saying depth guy. That's his song. He has a song. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=564.74s)]
*  I think I forget what it's called, but it's not got that guy. That was like number one [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=570.22s)]
*  in Spotify in Vietnam. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=574.94s)]
*  Real question. How long, what were you trying to do here? I'm a song piker at Twitch con [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=578.34s)]
*  and this is Paul. I was trying to draw a POG, the POG emo. I don't know. They, that's what [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=583.46s)]
*  I, I could not, I was not taking that seriously in that moment. Cause honestly, in my mind, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=590.78s)]
*  I was like, very stressed out trying to put the show together. You know what I mean? Like [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=596.18s)]
*  in my mind, I was not interested in that. I'll be, I'll be real. I was trying to do [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=601.78s)]
*  my very best, but what is the better cracker? Good. Can I hear it using a sentence, please? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=607.22s)]

*  Twitch con, by the way, that was preauthorized too. Like I asked, I was like, are you guys [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=631.02s)]
*  sure I can do this? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=636.06s)]
*  Like I can go with this because like you banned me for it before and they were like, yeah, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=637.06s)]
*  you can. That got me scared for a second. Yeah. No, they did. Sears from Ohio, by the [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=643.1800000000001s)]
*  way. Yeah. I know. Yeah. Twitch gave me the pass. They recognize my, they recognize my [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=648.3000000000001s)]
*  whiteness. This is what it looked like. Oh, the thing I drew. Oh my God. Here I'm a song [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=653.7800000000001s)]

*  Oh yeah. Why? I'll tell you one thing. Now, if our boy Nick over here throws it back on this country [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=815.54s)]
*  in the same way as mom throws it back, then I think we're going to be in good hands because [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=823.0600000000001s)]

*  Twitch. You try and become an actor, but you fail. You run out of money. Eventually. And one day you [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=848.66s)]
*  get into a car accident dance. You end up in a vegetative state life support. Eventually you [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=855.06s)]
*  watched all your loved ones give up on you. You eventually come out of it, resent society, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=862.5799999999999s)]
*  resent yourself, resent the healthcare system and you overdose on ketamine. And guess what? [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=868.5s)]
*  I'll be at your funeral drinking a martini. Yeah. Your points here. Good job. That's what happens [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=874.3399999999999s)]

*  else up. Yeah. I was, I didn't really fully know if like everybody appreciated or not. You know what [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=890.66s)]
*  I mean? I couldn't, I couldn't tell if like people were enjoying it, but you know, I looked at the [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=896.9s)]
*  reviews overall, try to get a better snapshot. And I think like the one thing that always happens [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=902.26s)]
*  in these, in these sorts of like big productions is like, I think it's like half an hour too long. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=908.98s)]
*  Like usually a lot of these shows go on for two hours. And I always feel like when I'm, you know, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=915.4599999999999s)]
*  name your price too. Like I always feel like it's like 30 minutes too long. If it's like [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=921.9399999999999s)]

*  it has to be a wee bit longer. Yeah. We raised $50,000 at the end of it, which was incredible. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=930.98s)]
*  I think for an impromptu show like this, where it's not like directed towards one singular cause [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=939.86s)]
*  that I'm speaking to, you know, having a, being able to raise like $50,000 like that. Fantastic. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=945.9399999999999s)]
*  You know, fantastic. And why I'll tell you one thing now, if our boy Nick, the live audience was [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=955.14s)]
*  so dead for most of it, which I was loving it. No, the audience. No, I don't think the audience was [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=963.3s)]

*  assumption because you could probably couldn't hear it because the audience wasn't miked up, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=974.5s)]
*  but no, they were going nuts, dude. But he throws it back on this country in the same way as mom [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=978.4200000000001s)]
*  throws it back. Then I think we're going to be in good hands because she's got good hands. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=984.0200000000001s)]
*  See her next mom actually watches me anyway. Yeah. I got them collapsed at the end of it. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=989.7s)]

*  He way better. I like it. Nick, you're describing slavery. Yes, I am. Oh, wow. I don't like it. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ea4dJ4dCk&t=1161.46s)]
