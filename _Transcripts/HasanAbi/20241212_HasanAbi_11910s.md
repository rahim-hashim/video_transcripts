*  I've worked in games for the best part of 20 years [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=301.2s)]
*  PlayStation, Disney, us two games, Square Enix [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=303.2s)]
*  I loved working there, I loved working on such massive games [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=307.2s)]
*  But I actually had a sense of guilt [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=310.2s)]
*  In parallel with my games career [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=313.2s)]
*  I've always had a passion, or I actually don't like to call it a passion [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=315.2s)]
*  I like to think it was a good purpose [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=319.2s)]
*  Woman and caring about the environment [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=321.2s)]
*  Nice tree, it's comfy [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=322.2s)]
*  We're less than 20 years away from climate collapse [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=325.2s)]
*  And for me that's incredibly scary [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=327.2s)]
*  Literal tree hugger, that's crazy [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=330.2s)]
*  But for my children's future [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=332.2s)]
*  It struck me that there was such an opportunity to use these games [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=335.2s)]

*  About what's happening in the world [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=342.2s)]
*  So when you play Longleaf Valley [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=344.2s)]
*  You're restoring and saving a national park [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=345.2s)]
*  And then as you're playing you're actually collecting tree tokens to plant a real tree [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=348.2s)]
*  Our players together have planted over 1.6 million trees now [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=352.2s)]

*  You play as Mio and Zoe [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2823.2s)]
*  Two aspiring writers that hope to get published by a new tech company [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2826.2s)]

*  L, red flags [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2849.2s)]
*  I need a strong and muscular guy [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2851.2s)]
*  Through the very worlds that they created [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2854.2s)]
*  Hands above your heads [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2857.2s)]
*  But the thing is, they're strangers [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2859.2s)]
*  And Mio writes sci-fi [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2861.2s)]
*  While Zoe writes fantasy [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2862.2s)]
*  So you will for every level in the game [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2864.2s)]
*  Jump between a sci-fi world [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2866.2s)]
*  And a fantasy world [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2868.2s)]
*  They're losing it! [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2869.2s)]
*  We at Hazelight love variation [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2875.2s)]
*  They're a unique mechanic for every level [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2877.2s)]
*  Let me give you some examples [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2879.2s)]
*  In this level, you start out by finding dragon eggs that hatch [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2881.2s)]
*  Hey! Stop licking [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2885.2s)]
*  And then they become a little bit bigger dragons with new abilities [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2887.2s)]
*  I don't know how to pop out chat [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2891.2s)]
*  But in the end, they grow up to be full ass dragons [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2892.2s)]
*  And now, you can fly around and kick ass [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2895.2s)]
*  In another level, you play these ball droids that can magnetize and shift to different forms [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2898.2s)]
*  It's gonna be awesome [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2902.2s)]
*  And then, the droids become your exosuits [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2904.2s)]
*  And you can now attack and hack different objects [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2907.2s)]
*  Here's another one [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2910.2s)]
*  You play as pigs [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2911.2s)]
*  And they later become... [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2912.2s)]
*  Anyway, let's not talk about that level for now [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2913.2s)]
*  And as always, with the friend's pass [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2916.2s)]
*  You only need to buy one coffee of the game to play it with your friend online [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2918.2s)]
*  That's what Hazelight is about [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2922.2s)]
*  No loot boxes, no microtransactions and no bullsh** [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2924.2s)]
*  You just get the game plan [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2927.2s)]
*  I'm paying parking tickets, time to die [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2929.2s)]
*  Excuse me? [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2931.2s)]
*  What? [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2932.2s)]
*  This is gonna be f**king dope [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2934.2s)]
*  It's gonna be dope [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2936.2s)]
*  Oh, they're all back [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2937.2s)]
*  They're saying WBass because no microtransactions [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2938.2s)]
*  Look, look, look, wait [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2940.2s)]
*  The good part with this, this game is coming out March 6 [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2941.2s)]
*  So you will be playing it in two months [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2944.2s)]

*  I love everybody, goodbye! [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2975.2s)]
*  Joseph, what a guy [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2977.2s)]
*  I spent some time with him in Sweden this summer [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2978.2s)]
*  And played a few hours of Flip Fiction [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2980.2s)]
*  It really is everything you'd want it to be [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2982.2s)]
*  A great follow-up to It Takes Two that Joseph won for Game of the Year [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2984.2s)]
*  It's been so amazing to have so many Game of the Year winners [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2987.2s)]
*  Back with us again tonight, revealing new projects [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2989.2s)]
*  Alright, we have much more Game Awards to come [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2992.2s)]
*  During the show, those of you in the US can head to TGLegion.com [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2994.2s)]
*  For a chance to win one of 20 Glacier White Lenovo Legion 7i laptops [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=2998.2s)]
*  Which have the power to handle the latest games [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3003.2s)]
*  This Lenovo Legion 7i has the power we need to finally beat the impossible level [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3006.2s)]
*  The screens are so high, I can see every NPC [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3011.2s)]
*  Except that one! [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3015.2s)]
*  Reach your husband, Lenovo Legion [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3017.2s)]
*  I missed it! Were they being woked? [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3022.2s)]
*  I need me that one [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3052.2s)]
*  No, not this one! No! [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3082.2s)]
*  No! No! [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3084.2s)]

*  Let's start the party! [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3159.2s)]
*  Alright, we're back here at the Game Awards and we have so much more to share with you [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3174.2s)]
*  Now when we created the TGA in 2014, I wanted to celebrate the people who devote their lives to entertaining [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3178.2s)]
*  And sometimes comforting or affecting us through video games [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3184.2s)]
*  In fact, 25 years ago back in college, I started writing a series of articles [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3187.2s)]
*  Called Behind the Games, Chronicle of the Game [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3191.2s)]
*  Which is a series of articles that are about the game's story [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3194.2s)]
*  And the story of the game's story [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3197.2s)]
*  25 years ago back in college, I started writing a series of articles [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3199.2s)]
*  Called Behind the Games, Chronicle of the Development of Games like Half-Life and Metal Gear Solid 2 [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3202.2s)]
*  Because I knew games were nothing without the people behind them [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3208.2s)]
*  Now the sad reality is that over the past few years, the gaming industry has suffered [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3211.2s)]
*  Significant and unprecedented industry-wide layoffs [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3216.2s)]
*  Those affect the games we get to play and even more importantly, the people who make the games we love [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3219.2s)]
*  We can debate and certainly disagree with the reasons why [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3225.2s)]
*  And honestly as a show, we kind of struggle with how to address these topics in a constructive way [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3229.2s)]
*  But this year, inside of these challenges, we found greatness [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3234.2s)]
*  I'm proud to share with you the story of a single individual who saw developers in need [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3239.2s)]
*  And did something truly extraordinary [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3245.2s)]
*  Meet TGA's first ever Game Changer [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3248.2s)]
*  Starting in early 2023, significant waves of layoffs started in the games industry [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3251.2s)]
*  It strikes you, it hurts, right? It's like a ton of bricks [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3260.2s)]
*  What am I supposed to do? [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3264.2s)]
*  Tens of thousands of gamers have been laid off at a level that is unprecedented in the industry's history [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3266.2s)]
*  I love this brand, I love this company, oh my goodness what am I going to do? [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3273.2s)]
*  I actually started in games relatively late [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3278.2s)]
*  Even though I've loved the industry ever since I was a little child [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3281.2s)]
*  Because there weren't games jobs around here [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3284.2s)]
*  This makes it so much more entertaining [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3287.2s)]
*  I stayed passionate about it and broke through in basically my late 30s [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3289.2s)]
*  I had seen a few friends get laid off before Thanksgiving [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3292.2s)]
*  And I said to my wife Jess like this is unacceptable [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3295.2s)]
*  Hi everybody, it's Amir and I'm here to help support you as you look for your next opportunity in video games [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3298.2s)]
*  I can't imagine what it must feel like for someone to have to go to their family around the holidays [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3305.2s)]
*  And say I don't have a job, I don't know what's going to happen [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3310.2s)]
*  I had a robust background in things like data analysis [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3313.2s)]
*  And I said well I can do something with this [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3316.2s)]
*  I started a community with one resource [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3318.2s)]
*  We just started putting together a list of all the job openings out there [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3321.2s)]
*  And over iteration after iteration it ended up becoming a suite of several different resources [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3325.2s)]
*  We have 2300 coaching volunteers who have given people over 50,000 community coaching conversations for free [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3331.2s)]
*  He's pure pro bono Amir [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3338.2s)]
*  There is no payment, he doesn't take anything back from the community [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3341.2s)]
*  I'm proud to say we've helped place nearly 3000 people in jobs [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3345.2s)]
*  It's funny to hate bald people while being an Asmongold fan [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3350.2s)]
*  It's like Amir Santa Claus [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3353.2s)]
*  If it worked for Amir and for this community I wouldn't have even known this job was here [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3355.2s)]
*  He has created this beacon of light [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3360.2s)]
*  Please join me in welcoming a man who has the well-being of the game developer community in his heart [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3367.2s)]
*  On behalf of the Game Awards I'm honored to present the first ever TGA Game Changer Amir Satpat [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3372.2s)]
*  Thank you [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3390.2s)]
*  Thank you so much [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3416.2s)]
*  No, you're breathtaking [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3420.2s)]
*  Thank you Jeff and the Game Awards for this extraordinary honor [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3425.2s)]
*  I can't help but say that I love video games with all my heart [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3429.2s)]
*  To all game makers everywhere [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3434.2s)]
*  You are seen and treasured and our community will always be there to help you [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3438.2s)]
*  Over the last three years we've lost more than 34,000 jobs [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3444.2s)]
*  A staggering amount of games experience eliminated [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3449.2s)]
*  This has consequences, you can't make great games without great people [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3453.2s)]
*  He's right [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3459.2s)]
*  But games don't understand that because they're fucking stupid [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3465.2s)]
*  I'm proud of so many of you who have already joined the game [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3468.2s)]
*  I really have to thank everyone in our community who gave all their time and commitment to build it [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3471.2s)]
*  As we gather here tonight for this amazing celebration [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3477.2s)]
*  I challenge everyone to ask themselves what more can we each do to make our industry better [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3481.2s)]
*  Unionize [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3487.2s)]
*  I dedicate this to my grandparents in heaven and to our Game Awards watch party back home [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3489.2s)]
*  My wife and I [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3495.2s)]
*  And to our Game Awards watch party back home [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3497.2s)]
*  My wife, our three sons [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3500.2s)]
*  And my parents [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3504.2s)]
*  Really devoted their lives to me and taught me that my value lies in how I treat other people [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3510.2s)]
*  Growing up, all I ever wanted was to be a part of the video game industry [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3518.2s)]
*  As a kid from Farmington, Connecticut it felt a world away [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3523.2s)]
*  Not anymore, thank you very very much [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3527.2s)]
*  Thank you [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3530.2s)]
*  Thank you [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3532.2s)]
*  It's so funny because like [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3535.2s)]
*  The industry is slammed with people that are unimaginably talented [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3537.2s)]
*  And they just get fired after making good games [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3543.2s)]
*  In record profit years over and over again [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3547.2s)]
*  Because that increases the profit margins [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3551.2s)]
*  And then they only hyper focus on live service garbage [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3554.2s)]
*  DLCs and loot boxes because they want to make money [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3559.2s)]
*  But gamers don't understand that it's capitalism that's at fault here [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3564.2s)]
*  So they yell at fucking developers who look exactly like the sweaty fucking gamers themselves [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3567.2s)]
*  But then all this like sweet baby ink shit [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3581.2s)]
*  Makes, it's like a Psyop, it makes gamers fucking hyper focus on the dumbest shit for no reason [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3584.2s)]
*  How are you gonna shit on Titanfall? [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3599.2s)]
*  No, Titanfall is great, you're wrong [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3602.2s)]
*  I'm gonna destroy you [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3610.2s)]
*  You will face a new power and devastating [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3623.2s)]
*  But this is your time [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3631.2s)]
*  Unleash the hunter within [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3636.2s)]
*  Unleash the hunter within [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3640.2s)]
*  That was the announcement of Steel Hunters which you can play test tonight [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3652.2s)]
*  I played that back in the summer and it plays as good as it looks [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3655.2s)]
*  Definitely has a Transformers vibe to it as you can see [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3658.2s)]
*  Really fun game [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3660.2s)]
*  Alright and now I'm proud to reveal one of the most beautiful games I've seen in a long time [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=3662.2s)]

*  It's a modern oracle, so they made me sign an nda [[03:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11070.359999999999s)]
*  But I trust all of you. I know you can keep a secret. You will never leak it [[03:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11074.119999999999s)]

*  Who found the formula to make it up here on stage? [[03:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11083.4s)]
*  It's stupidly simple, but somehow it keeps on getting lost [[03:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11087.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a gaza's inspire pin because they wanted to make a game that they wanted to play themselves [[03:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11091.64s)]
*  They created it because it hadn't been created before they didn't make it to increase market share [[03:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11095.96s)]
*  They didn't make it to serve as a brand [[03:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11101.48s)]
*  They didn't have to meet arbitrary sales targets or fear being laid off if they mean it didn't meet those targets [[03:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11104.08s)]
*  And furthermore the people in charge [[03:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11111.0s)]
*  Forbade them from cramming the game with anything whose only purpose was to increase revenue and didn't serve the game design [[03:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11113.679999999998s)]
*  They didn't treat their developers like numbers on a spreadsheet [[03:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11120.88s)]
*  They didn't treat their players as users to exploit [[03:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11124.119999999999s)]
*  And they didn't make decisions. They knew were short-sighted in function of a bonus or politics [[03:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11127.96s)]
*  They knew that if you put the game and the team first the revenue will follow [[03:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11134.439999999999s)]
*  They were driven by idealism and wanted players to have fun, and they realized that if the developers didn't have fun [[03:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11139.0s)]
*  Nobody was going to have any fun [[03:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11144.88s)]
*  They understood the value of respect that if they treated their developers and players well [[03:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11146.599999999999s)]
*  Those same developers and players would forgive them when things didn't go as planned [[03:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11151.92s)]
*  But above all they cared about their game because they loved games [[03:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11156.44s)]
*  It's really that simple set the oracle winning game of the year [[03:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11161.32s)]

*  I just don't understand it. [[03:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11494.6s)]
*  Like, there were people when it first came out, [[03:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11496.6s)]
*  there were people in my chat that were like, [[03:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11498.6s)]
*  you got on my Astrobot, but I did, like... [[03:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11500.6s)]

*  Thank you. [[03:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11515.6s)]
*  It's you guys' work. [[03:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11521.6s)]
*  You know, when I thought about, you know, why this game, you know, [[03:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11524.6s)]
*  give people joy and smiles on their faces, [[03:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11528.6s)]
*  I think it came down to the people every day making the game, [[03:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11530.6s)]
*  and it's doing exactly that. [[03:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11532.6s)]
*  I think, you know, when I think of the team, [[03:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11534.6s)]
*  it's the amount of generosity they gave. [[03:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11536.6s)]
*  They put the user first always, you know, [[03:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11538.6s)]
*  never thought about any calculation. [[03:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11540.6s)]
*  It was just about the kids especially, [[03:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11543.6s)]
*  because we had this huge, huge privilege to be potentially the first game to be in the hands of children, [[03:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11545.6s)]
*  and we know what it means very much. [[03:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11552.6s)]
*  So, team AstroBee, really, from the bottom of our heart, [[03:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11554.6s)]
*  you know, well done and thank you so much. [[03:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11558.6s)]
*  Now, thank you. [[03:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11560.6s)]
*  The whole industry thinks it's great. [[03:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11563.6s)]
*  Some people just think it's a big ad. [[03:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11564.6s)]
*  Everybody likes it. [[03:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11565.6s)]
*  I have to thank a few more people, [[03:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11567.6s)]
*  because a lot of people contributed to this game, of course, [[03:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11568.6s)]
*  in SAE, PlayStation or 5 Mini. [[03:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11570.6s)]
*  You know, Herman, who gave, you know, the studio a chance and... [[03:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11573.6s)]
*  I bet people were mentioning it, yeah, because I was playing Wukong [[03:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11577.6s)]
*  and people were being annoying. [[03:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11579.6s)]
*  Ken Chan on marketing and many, many other people that I'm not mentioning. [[03:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11583.6s)]
*  You know, AstroBot is full of 30 years of PlayStation history, [[03:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11587.6s)]
*  and actually a lot of people in this room tonight [[03:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11590.6s)]
*  gave their characters, their IP, without asking anything in return, [[03:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11592.6s)]
*  just because they cared about celebrating 30 years. [[03:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11596.6s)]
*  So to them as well, you know, from the bottom of our heart, [[03:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11600.6s)]
*  thank you so much. [[03:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11602.6s)]
*  And then last and not least, and you want to stay for this one, [[03:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11607.6s)]
*  because I didn't plan to say it, but I'm going to say it anyway. [[03:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11610.6s)]
*  You know, platformers, you know, PlayStation 30 years, [[03:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11615.6s)]
*  and we made a platformer, which is great. [[03:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11619.6s)]
*  It's very nostalgic and fresh at the same time. [[03:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11621.6s)]
*  They had to give it to the fucking Sony game, dude. [[03:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11623.6s)]
*  Let's not forget that even before PlayStation, [[03:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11625.6s)]
*  there were people making platformers. [[03:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11627.6s)]
*  I remember I was a kid in 1989, Christmas, and I got a gray box. [[03:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11629.6s)]
*  It was a game packed in. [[03:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11633.6s)]
*  It was called Super Mario Bros. and it was really, really great. [[03:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11635.6s)]
*  So we are in Japan, we're in Tokyo, they are in Kyoto, [[03:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11638.6s)]
*  but I want to pay tribute to the company who really put, like, platformers [[03:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11644.6s)]
*  and showed us innovation and quality consistently. [[03:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11649.6s)]
*  I am a Sony fanboy, but Wukong is a fucking awesome game. [[03:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11653.6s)]
*  I wanted not to mention them, have you noticed? [[03:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11657.6s)]
*  But you all know who they are, [[03:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11659.6s)]
*  and many other companies have been inspired over the years. [[03:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11661.6s)]
*  And Elden Ring, I mean, Elden Ring was a DLC, so it's unacceptable. [[03:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11663.6s)]
*  I want to pay tribute to them tonight. [[03:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11666.6s)]
*  So from the bottom of our heart, thank you so much. [[03:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11668.6s)]
*  It's amazing, and we'll see you again. [[03:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11670.6s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[03:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11673.6s)]
*  The DLC couldn't have won. [[03:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11679.6s)]
*  That would have been unacceptable. [[03:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11684.6s)]
*  But, like, is Wukong Game of the Year material just another Souls-like clone? [[03:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11686.6s)]
*  Congratulations, Astrobot, and that is going to do it for our 10th anniversary of the Game of Wards. [[03:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11691.6s)]
*  Bro, it had a lot of... [[03:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11695.6s)]

*  Yeah, but Blackman Wukong was on all platforms. [[03:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11724.6s)]
*  Astrobot was a PlayStation exclusive. [[03:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11726.6s)]
*  Have a good night. [[03:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11728.6s)]
*  Is Astrobot just a tutorial on how to use a PlayStation controller? [[03:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11730.6s)]
*  It was. [[03:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11734.6s)]
*  It actually wasn't bat... That's the same game, right? [[03:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11736.6s)]
*  I think Wukong sold that mostly in China. [[03:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11766.6s)]
*  They didn't vote on this. [[03:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQNbDpALLDM&t=11768.6s)]
