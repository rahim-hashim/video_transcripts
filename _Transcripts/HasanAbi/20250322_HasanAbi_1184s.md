# U.S.–Houthi Tensions Escalate | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [March 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk)
*  There's no more outside elements that are even involved in trying to dismantle the current leadership. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=0.0s)]
*  And virtually every single group that engaged in armed combat backed by the UAE or backed by Saudi Arabia, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=8.0s)]
*  or even Al Qaeda itself, has basically dropped their arms and either directly support... [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  Anyway, top Houthi official says, we are at war with America as the US resumes strikes. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=21.84s)]
*  Overnight Houthi rebels fired another missile at Israel. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=32.88s)]
*  Osmanlı gold. Osmanlı. Osmanoğlu gold. Osmanoğlu. Altın Osmanoğlu. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=36.32s)]
*  Not Reis, now he is Sultan. Yeah. Sultan olmuş adam. Reis değil artık. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=41.84s)]
*  How can Turkey cut off power to Israel? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=46.559999999999995s)]
*  More than 20% of the entire electricity grid from Israel comes by way of Turkey from Azerbaijan. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  If Turkey wanted to shut off Israel's power, they literally could. Or more than 20%. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  I'm getting the percentages wrong, I think. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=62.72s)]
*  ...from their base in Yemen. The Houthis are labeled by the United States as a foreign organization, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=64.88s)]
*  supported by Iran. And yesterday, President Trump once again demanded Iran cease its support [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=71.36s)]
*  and wrote of the Houthis, they will be completely annihilated. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=77.36s)]
*  Nick Schifrin speaks to a top Houthi official and reports how the Trump [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=80.88s)]
*  administration hopes its new airstrike campaign will succeed where previous ones have failed. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=84.88s)]
*  In the Red Sea once again, the U.S. Navy is at war. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=94.24s)]
*  Say bye-bye, Americans. Bye-bye to free college. Every time you watch one of these videos, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=101.36s)]
*  remember, bye-bye to free healthcare. Let's wave away. Bye-bye. Trump acting like he hates, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=107.84s)]
*  hates Brandon. So much war, so much war caused by Brandon. Thank God he's doing something very [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=116.72s)]
*  different than Brandon. Oh, that's right. He's doing the exact same thing that Brandon did. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=125.92s)]
*  Operation Save Amazon Prime 2 Electric Boogaloo, baby. Donald Trump saved Gaza in one day, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=130.48000000000002s)]
*  saved Ukraine in one day. The great peacekeeper. Bless him. Every time the secular right sabotages [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=136.4s)]
*  the elections, they blame it on the left, claiming we didn't go hard enough to change the minds of [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=143.20000000000002s)]
*  hawks from Qaiz. It's the same thing the centrals do in the U.S. Only difference is that we get [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=146.0s)]
*  jailed and tortured in Turkey. Yeah. For six days, the U.S. has launched dozens of strikes [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=148.96s)]
*  against the U.S. and sorties attacking Houthi targets in Yemen, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=155.36s)]
*  including for the first time, Houthi leadership. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=163.04000000000002s)]
*  At the end of the day, we are at war with America. And of course there will be. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=170.16000000000003s)]
*  Is bro Roggen a Herman Miller? Because respect, if that's the case. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=173.84s)]
*  But these casualties do not include senior leadership. Jamal Amer is the Houthi foreign [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=178.16000000000003s)]
*  minister. We spoke to him from the Houthi controlled Yemeni capital, Sanaa. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=182.72s)]
*  Civilians in Sanaa were. It's so funny because they will be like, oh, the Houthi controlled [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=189.04s)]
*  capitals and first of all, I can't believe PBS is platforming a terrorist. OK, I'm sure all of the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  liberal slop tubers who claim that they're apolitical centrist, but also love American violence [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=201.76s)]
*  will will turn around and get real mad about this shit. That's number one. Of course they want number [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=208.96s)]
*  two. Yeah, the snark slop tubers whose only understanding of worldviews is a worldview. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  Global events is a is basically what does Hassan think? OK, I'm against that. So. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=219.76000000000002s)]
*  The other thing I was going to say is like when these guys say like a Houthi controlled Sanaa, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=228.08s)]
*  that's a stupid way to approach this. Ansa Allah is the current administration in control of Yemen. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=232.24s)]
*  OK, the civil war is done. There's no more outside elements that are even involved in [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=239.04000000000002s)]
*  trying to dismantle the current leadership. And virtually every single group that engaged [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=246.0s)]
*  in armed combat backed by the UAE or backed by Saudi Arabia or even Al Qaeda itself has basically [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=252.72s)]
*  dropped their arms and either directly support either directly support the onslaught a lot [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=259.04s)]
*  movement and its blockade and the implementation of the blockade as long as then Gaza continues [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=264.8s)]
*  or they're just not saying anything. Yeah. It's crazy. Oh, my God. Trump and White House [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=271.28000000000003s)]
*  officials claim that their aggression on Yemen is killing our children and peoples to protect [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=278.40000000000003s)]
*  the American people. Well, just look at Jackson Hinkle, see how we torture him and put him at [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=280.96000000000004s)]
*  risk in a traditional Yemeni outfit. Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm not going to say nothing. OK, I I'm [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=284.24s)]
*  not saying nothing. OK, Jackson Hinkle literally is one pro Trump like openly and two is pro Tulsi [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=290.8s)]
*  Gabbard openly like what are you? Yeah, whatever. Hey, listen, I'm not saying nothing. All right. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=303.44s)]
*  I'm not saying nothing. I'm sure he's not a I'm sure he's a real you're saying something. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=310.56s)]
*  Yeah, people get really mad at me when I point out how interesting it is that that you got [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=318.56s)]
*  in the United States of America, dudes like Mahmoud Khalil being deported and arrested. OK, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=324.88s)]
*  legal permanent residence for the crime of protesting Israel and being a student activist [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=331.44s)]
*  leader. And Jackson Hinkle just doing whatever he wants, OK, doing whatever he wants all around [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=336.71999999999997s)]
*  the world. It's just odd that he's, you know, pro Trump and openly a mega communist. And he's still, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=344.0s)]
*  you know, he found a unique avenue where he's just both pro Trump and also [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=354.4s)]
*  armed because the Capitol was targeted with the authorities say the strikes have wounded or killed [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=361.36s)]
*  dozens, including children. The U.S. denies any civilian casualties and instead blames the Houthis [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=366.40000000000003s)]
*  for bringing it on themselves. Beginning in November, twenty twenty three Houthi rebels targeted, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=372.96000000000004s)]
*  seized commercial vessels and kidnapped and killed foreign sailors. The Houthis [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=379.68s)]
*  claim to target ships linked to Israel and solid. All they killed foreign sailors. Maybe I'm wrong. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=384.64000000000004s)]
*  But I don't remember them. I don't remember them killing foreign sailors. Did they? Maybe they did. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=390.96000000000004s)]
*  I don't know. Let's see. Maybe they did. These commercials kidnapped. Who do they kill? Oh, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=396.24s)]
*  they did. This was their first fatal attack. Who they claim missile attack on Greek operated [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=402.40000000000003s)]
*  Barbados flat commercial ship kills three sailors off the coast of Yemen. They did. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=407.04s)]
*  Correcting the record here. Yeah, they were showing the galaxy leader apprehension that did not. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=410.56s)]
*  There were no casualties in that one. These claim responsible for the attack on Wednesday was set [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=416.8s)]
*  the Liberian on Barbados flagship true confidence of blades approximately 50 nautical miles off the [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=420.96000000000004s)]
*  coast of Yemen's port of Aden. The U.S. military central command reported three fatalities, at least [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=425.04s)]
*  four injuries of three are in critical condition as well as significant damage to the ship. Two [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=428.8s)]
*  earlier photos released by U.S. military show the ship's bridging cargo on board a blaze. These [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=432.24s)]
*  reckless attacks by the Houthis have disrupted global trade and taking the lives of international [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=436.56s)]
*  seafarers simply doing their jobs are some of the hardest jobs in the world. Earlier on Wednesday, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=439.76s)]
*  the United Kingdom's maritime trade operations agency and the vessel was no longer under the [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=443.52s)]
*  command of the crew. They had abandoned it. Brigadier General Yahya Sadi, a Houthi military [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=447.2s)]
*  spokesman, claimed the attack in a pre-recorded message saying its missile set fired set the blaze. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=451.44s)]
*  He said the rebels attack would only stop when the siege on the Palestinian people in Gaza is [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=457.59999999999997s)]
*  lifted. After the missile hit, the crew abandoned the ship and deployed lifeboats. The U.S. warship [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=460.64s)]
*  and the Indian Navy were on board the scene trying to assist the rescue efforts. The jaric said the [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=463.76s)]
*  attacks are causing risk to property, life and ecology in the area. Houthi fighters in Yemen [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=468.47999999999996s)]
*  repeatedly launched drones and missiles against international commercial shipping since mid [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=471.68s)]
*  November. Houthi attacks have disrupted global shipping, forcing firms to reroute [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=475.28000000000003s)]
*  to the longer and more expensive journey around southern Africa. Breaking a blockade is dangerous, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=478.88s)]
*  but it's still it's still fucked up. Come on, dude. What are you talking about? Unless you're [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=485.28000000000003s)]
*  Israel, when you can kill international global charity organizations and their members and you [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=489.2s)]
*  can totally get away with that because you were doing a genocide. If you are against the genocide [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=495.12s)]
*  and trying to implement a blockade and in the in the in that instance, you end up killing seafarers. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=500.72s)]
*  Of course, that's the I mean, I personally do think it's unacceptable for the record. I just [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=507.84000000000003s)]
*  want to make sure you understand. Like these are random fucking sailors, you know, implementing a [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=512.08s)]
*  blockade is one thing, but blowing up a ship that blowing a ship and then killing sailors is not [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=517.52s)]
*  oh, it is not even remotely appropriate. It was not on purpose. I know, but still smart more than [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=525.44s)]
*  a month and a half of US laid air raids on the Houthis. The Rubas remain capable of launching [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=531.84s)]
*  significant attacks. How do you enforce a blockade then overtake the ships like they did in the past? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=536.24s)]
*  Were they armed? No, I don't think they were armed. No, I don't think these were I don't think these [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=542.5600000000001s)]
*  were like this was completely this was no they didn't have got the chat. You don't have to fucking [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=546.72s)]
*  literally assume that every single action taken by the Ansar Allah movement is ultimately the [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=556.64s)]
*  correct action. There's no reason to like yes, these are not armed boats. Okay, they're international [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=564.3199999999999s)]
*  commercial shipping vessels. They don't have any arms on them. It's illegal [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=571.92s)]
*  to have any arms on them. Yeah. Who the assault on Tuesday apparently targeted the US carny. He was [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=576.88s)]
*  his carny and Arleigh Burke class destroyer that has been involved in the US campaign against the [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=582.0799999999999s)]
*  rebels. The attack on carny involved bomb carrying drones on an anti-tank ballistic missile. The US [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=585.04s)]
*  leader launched an air raid destroying three anti-ship missiles and three bomb carrying [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=588.48s)]
*  drone boats. Central Command said, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=591.1999999999999s)]
*  Oh, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=592.5600000000001s)]
*  is sent to court for arrest. As of this moment, they're sending into the court [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=595.52s)]
*  solidarity with Gaza, but their targets were much wider. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=599.9200000000001s)]
*  During the Gaza ceasefire, they paused their attacks on ships. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=604.96s)]
*  But when Israel blocked humanitarian aid to Gaza, the Houthis vowed to respond. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=610.32s)]
*  And last Saturday, President Trump ordered the new strikes that Secretary of Defense Pete [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=614.88s)]
*  Hegset told Fox News will continue until the Houthis stop. This will continue until you say, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=619.68s)]
*  we're done shooting at ships. We're done shooting at assets. Will you stop [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=626.0799999999999s)]
*  your targeting of Navy ships and commercial ships? When the siege on Gaza ends, the tension in the [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=629.92s)]
*  Red Sea will end. Therefore, when Gaza receives aid and Israel implements the agreement, everything [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwA-Kd5YDtk&t=636.8s)]
