# Trump Is Getting Impatient With Netanyahu | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4)
*  I wound up talking about you when I got back in touch with old friend people, literally [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=0.0s)]
*  just repeat points from drama, slop tubers. We'll walk them back once a reasonable person [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=3.36s)]
*  argues against them. Yes. Also the greatest fucking, the greatest antidote to those vicious [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=6.68s)]
*  smears is just showing the full context. Okay. That's it. You remember that. Okay. Hassan [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=12.24s)]
*  and detainment. Okay. Chill. That's not what it looked like. Oh my God. Oh my Lord. Oh [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=21.92s)]
*  my freaking Lord. Oh Lordy. So obviously we got the tariffs. I'm not done with this. The, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=34.800000000000004s)]
*  the, like the U S Israel decoupling a little bit, but one more thing to talk about with [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=42.0s)]
*  Biden, because a lot of people are asking me, Hey, what do you think? What do you think about [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=47.84s)]
*  like Kamala Harris now? And the reality of the matter is I've said the same thing that I said [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  last time around, which is that yes, Donald Trump being a brash filmmaker and his love for like deals [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=61.2s)]
*  that make him look good is unironically playing a role in, in him taking decisions that the Biden [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=70.56s)]
*  administration never took on purpose. And if the Kamala administration was going to continue along [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=78.4s)]
*  as she signaled with the Biden administration's agenda on Israel, on the, that Israel was doing, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=84.56s)]
*  then so far, depending on what Donald Trump does going forward in the next week or so, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=90.4s)]
*  I can confidently say that it might even be better. It could be significantly worse still, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=96.08s)]
*  because as I've said over and over again, that Donald Trump is very malleable. He's endlessly [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=101.52s)]
*  persuadable and also doesn't give a single shit about the Palestinians, but neither did Kamala [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=108.8s)]
*  Harris. And it's more so a matter of like, who is willing to buck the trend of unconditional loyalty [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=115.92s)]
*  to Israel? And Donald Trump's personal character flaws might have actually played a formative role [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=123.91999999999999s)]
*  in him bucking said trend in a way that I don't think Kamala Harris or any reasonable statesman [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=133.12s)]
*  ever would. Does that make sense? Didn't he get fooled after the ceasefire in January? He let it [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=138.88s)]
*  fall apart. He didn't get fooled necessarily. I thought, I said, I was very cynical while I was, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=142.95999999999998s)]
*  of course, complimentary and excited at the prospect of a ceasefire, regardless of how it [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=148.0s)]
*  was being conducted. I still maintain the position that, you know, it was most likely [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=152.08s)]
*  for a sinister purpose of re-upping, re-arming, and then potentially potentially going, moving [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=157.68s)]
*  into the West bank in a more significant fashion. There are, there are, there are a lot of factors [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=165.12s)]
*  here. There are a lot of factors here at play. Okay. There are a lot of factors here at play [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=171.68s)]
*  that, that I think changed the calculation for Donald Trump and caused Donald Trump to, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=178.4s)]
*  what the fuck? Anyway, cause Donald Trump to do something that I don't think Kamala Harris [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=187.04s)]
*  or Joe Biden ever did. Joe Biden never did this. And Kamala Harris never signaled that she would [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=192.64s)]
*  do anything different than Joe Biden. Moin Rabbani, let's hear what his analysis is, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=198.72s)]
*  says it has been a day of dramatic developments in the middle East, although their significance [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=203.6s)]
*  remains to be determined. Most importantly, we learned that Washington and Hamas are once again [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=206.72s)]
*  negotiating. The available reports suggest that these talks were conducted indirectly via Qatar [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=210.4s)]
*  and Egypt. And according to some reports, Turkey as well, we're at the table, shuts out rather [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=214.64s)]
*  than consisting of renewed face-to-face meetings. It is a fair assumption that if direct U.S. Hamas [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=218.64s)]
*  meetings had taken place, these would once again have been leaked by an Israeli, by Israel in an [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=222.56s)]
*  effort to scuttle them anew. At the same time, Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu appears [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=227.12s)]
*  to have finally realized that under Trump and his secretary of state, Steve Witkoff, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=232.0s)]
*  Israel's leash, Israel's leash is considerably shorter than it was under his predecessors, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=237.2s)]
*  Biden, Blinken and Sullivan. This is 100% correct by the way. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=241.44s)]
*  Like regardless of Donald Trump's statements about like ethnically cleansing the Gaza strip and all [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=246.72s)]
*  of the ridiculous shit that he has said, you also have to pay attention to what Trump has done. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=252.88s)]
*  What Trump has done has been directly, directly undermining Benjamin Netanyahu's confidence, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=258.15999999999997s)]
*  directly undermining Benjamin Netanyahu's interests. Okay. The latter, it will be recalled, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=264.47999999999996s)]
*  left their favorite proxy free to rampage through the neighborhood without either a leash or indeed [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=270.4s)]
*  any other restraint. Witkoff's assistant deputy for DEI affairs, Marco Rubio, holds views virtually [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=275.03999999999996s)]
*  identical to Biden on Israel, but has been kept preoccupied saving the U.S. from imminent [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=282.0s)]
*  destruction by locking up college students in the swamps of Louisiana. According to both U.S. and [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=285.84s)]
*  Israeli reports, Washington wary of Israel's determination to sabotage U.S. diplomatic [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=290.32s)]
*  initiatives that prioritize U.S. over Israeli interests, didn't inform the Israeli government [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=294.4s)]
*  about these talks until after an agreement was concluded with Hamas. It seems likely that Israel's [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=298.47999999999996s)]
*  loyalists in the Trump administration were also kept out of loop as a precautionary measure. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=303.52s)]
*  Recent revelations that national security advisor, Mike Waltz was scheming with Netanyahu to unleash [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=307.52s)]
*  a war against Iran that would serve Israel's national security at the expense of that of the [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=311.76s)]
*  U.S. appears to have landed particularly badly in the White House. The specifics of the U.S. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=316.71999999999997s)]
*  Hamas agreement remains somewhat unclear. This is important to note as well. Israel keeps saying, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=321.76s)]
*  oh, they were not giving anything in this. These morons, they like gave away a hostage for no [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=327.44s)]
*  reason. We're not actually going to change anything. Isn't that literally treason? Ha, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=333.59999999999997s)]
*  cute. Why would that be considered treason if it's done at the behest of Israel? Hello? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=339.12s)]
*  It's just seen as a difference in opinion in American foreign policy. It's about how hard you [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=346.08s)]
*  dick ride Israel. Okay. Or how hard you want to bomb Iran. Mike Waltz and other other other [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=351.68s)]
*  state department loyalists actually have this attitude where they're just like, they have this [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=359.28s)]
*  open perspective where they want to run super hard. And there are some people who want to [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=364.16s)]
*  bomb Iran less hard. Okay. That's it. It's just seen as a difference in opinion. And if it's, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=369.28000000000003s)]
*  as long as it's for Israel, it's not considered to be treason anyway, because Israel is seen, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=374.8s)]
*  at least at this point, you must understand Israel is not seen as a separate entity. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=379.68s)]
*  It is seen as a part of the American design in the region. Okay. But even in that process, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=384.16s)]
*  they can get out of hand in a way where, in a way where they can actually compromise America's [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=391.6s)]
*  interests. Like America might say, Hey, you know, you want to cut this out a little bit. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=396.56s)]
*  You want to dial this back a little bit. You're up the bag for everybody. And Israel says, no, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=400.96000000000004s)]
*  I'm going to keep doing it. What can you do? We have a shit ton of influence. And then America [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=405.44s)]
*  can reign Israel back in by doing stuff like this. Okay. By saying, Hey, no, we control all the cards [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=410.24s)]
*  here. Know your place. How do you look at your Christmas entire work in Trump one and think he's [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=416.48s)]
*  on your side? I never said that. I don't think that careful react, uh, reaching nuance overload, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=420.48s)]
*  buddy. You're losing the libs. I know. I think what's really funny about this is that Trump is [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=425.6s)]
*  a malleable figure who has a hair trigger and is, is like, like gets annoyed easily. And that [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=430.24s)]
*  actually is under, uh, plays. I mean, that can harm America's foreign policy interests, but in [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=438.40000000000003s)]
*  this situation, I think it's like causing them to decouple a little bit from, uh, from the, the [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=445.36s)]
*  hand in glove approach that they've had so far with Israel, the specifics of the U S and mosque [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=452.48s)]
*  agreement remains somewhat unclear. The only confirmed details of the Hamas will release [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=456.88s)]
*  Eden Alexander and Israeli soldier who holds a U S dual citizenship. And that the secretary state [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=460.0s)]
*  Witkoff is traveling to Israel Monday to finalize the handover. I liked that Mo and Rabani jokingly [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=464.40000000000003s)]
*  calls the secretary, the real secretary of state, uh, Steve Witkoff, which is understandable that [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=468.48s)]
*  he's saying that. And he calls Marco Rubio, the deputy DEI director. They're basically, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=473.84s)]
*  they're, they're, they're basically keeping him, uh, they're giving him busy work to just like, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=480.56s)]
*  try and detain, uh, U S college students for writing articles and stuff so that, you know, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=485.2s)]
*  he stays busy with busy work like that. If matters proceed as planned, this will once [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=491.35999999999996s)]
*  again, confirm that for Israel, the release of captives from Gaza strip is a pretext for [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=496.64s)]
*  genocide rather than genuine political or military priority. It also visibly demonstrates that [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=500.08000000000004s)]
*  foreign governments are considerably more and more seriously invested in the efforts to repatriate [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=504.08000000000004s)]
*  their citizens than is Israel. This explains the subdued mood to put it mildly of the yellow ribbon [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=507.44s)]
*  crowd. Learn upon learning of the agreement to release a captive Witkoff statement. We don't, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=512.8000000000001s)]
*  we want to bring hostages home, but Israel's not willing to end the war in this regard, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=517.76s)]
*  rightfully adds insult to injury. Steve Witkoff having that honest moment and stating that we [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=522.32s)]
*  want to fluck in, we are genuinely interested in bringing the hostages home. Israel is not, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=528.88s)]
*  is significant, is significant, especially when he says that American media has to report on it [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=533.28s)]
*  for once. Jesus Christ. Neither Washington nor Hamas have confirmed any of the agreements. Other [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=538.88s)]
*  reported details apart from a limited suspension of hostility so that Hamas can safely hand over [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=543.36s)]
*  its captive Hamas's statement that is releasing Alexander as a goodwill gesture and statements [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=547.04s)]
*  by Trump, Witkoff and us hostage envoy, Adam Baylor, that the release is being conducted in [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=551.04s)]
*  good faith would appear to confirm that formally, at least the Palestinians are receiving nothing [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=554.88s)]
*  in return. What they're receiving instead is direct talks in Qatar with America. Israel was [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=558.8s)]
*  not even interested in coming to the table until recently. Once this happened, now Israel is sending [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=565.28s)]
*  an envoy to Qatar to restart the agreements, to restart ceasefire talks. Why are they doing this? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=570.8s)]
*  Because they don't want to cut, they don't want to let America cut a deal without Israel at the table. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=578.24s)]
*  They're gross pieces of shit. That's the reason why Eden Alexander was released today. Do you [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=582.4799999999999s)]
*  understand? So now the very same Netanyahu that spent yesterday crying and saying like, oh, we [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=587.2s)]
*  got to really reconsider our security cooperation. We got to sanitize our security agreement with the [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=593.2s)]
*  United States of America. We'll now turn around and try to take credit for it. Okay. Then Yahoo [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=597.84s)]
*  is claiming credit and saying, oh, we played a role in this. Meanwhile, he never actually played a [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=602.96s)]
*  role in this. He literally acts deal from happening. Don't forget May 11th source. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=607.6800000000001s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=612.8s)]
*  And I think that, I think that it showcases, because there are, like people want black and [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=732.8s)]
*  white terms on this stuff, right? They want, Oh, Trump no longer believes in Israel. He hates [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=745.4399999999999s)]
*  Israel or Trump got annoyed by Israel and like wanted to cut a side deal with Hamas directly. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=750.64s)]
*  But the reality of the matter is you have to look at the totality of the decisions and what the [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=755.92s)]
*  American government has said and done thus far. And you have to also look at the actions that [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=761.36s)]
*  they've taken place or their inaction rather. And yes, they allowed Israel to do this insane, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=767.4399999999999s)]
*  big push for the past two months, bombing Gaza relentlessly while simultaneously starving the [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=775.76s)]
*  entire Gaza population. And they didn't say a single fucking thing about that as everyone was [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=782.8s)]
*  screaming about this, this annihilationist principle that they were applying, that Israel [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=789.9200000000001s)]
*  was applying in the Gaza strip. So that's important to take note of. So perhaps maybe from the Trump [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=796.0s)]
*  perspective, this looks like the Ukrainian counteroffensive, not to say there's no more [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=802.96s)]
*  moral equivalence between Ukraine and Israel, by the way, I'm simply saying that it was, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=807.2s)]
*  it most, it might've been seen from the Trump administration as like Israel saying that they're [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=813.52s)]
*  going to achieve their war goals and failing to do so with the timeframe that was given to Israel. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=818.16s)]
*  And therefore Trump was like, all right, I'm cutting a side deal. You're fucking done. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=825.6s)]
*  What you're telling me is increasingly impossible with Trump state visit to several Gulf countries [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=831.04s)]
*  imminent, the images of a mess emaciated and dying children of Gaza strip and of many more [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=838.24s)]
*  dismembered by us supplied high explosives on a daily basis needed to be addressed. That's where [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=842.64s)]
*  the agreement with Hamas came in. In this context reports that Wicuff intends to resurrect the [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=847.76s)]
*  January agreement may well be credible. It is certainly plausible that Hamas received informal [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=852.3199999999999s)]
*  U S assurances to this effect and plausible such assurances, if indeed provided will prove to be [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=856.3199999999999s)]
*  worthless. The problem is that this could all prove a repeat of what we experienced in January, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=861.76s)]
*  February of this year. This is a real fear. This is why I'm skeptical as well, where they come back [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=866.4s)]
*  and they say, oh yeah, we want to ceasefire. Actually, we're going to get Israel to the table. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=870.72s)]
*  We're going to get Israel to do a ceasefire and then tell them, you know, all right, go, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=874.16s)]
*  go kill as many people as you want. We don't give a shit. Right. That is the, that is a real fear [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=878.8s)]
*  here. I think that's a understandable and reasonable fear to hold onto in this situation. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=884.7199999999999s)]
*  Back then Trump forced the ceasefire down Netanyahu's throat, not as a part of a [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=896.0799999999999s)]
*  diplomatic strategy to end Israel's war, but as a temporary fix to ensure smooth inauguration [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=899.6s)]
*  highlighted by a political achievement. Biden had been so too timid to secure. Once the inauguration [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=903.36s)]
*  was over, the new admin quickly lost interest. In other words, it is entirely possible. We'll be [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=908.48s)]
*  back to square one. Once Trump takes to the skies to fly back to Washington, Israel has repeatedly [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=913.12s)]
*  announced that it intends to escalate its genocidal campaign yet further. If no agreement is reached [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=918.32s)]
*  by the conclusion of Trump's visit, it will therefore be only a matter of days before we [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=923.2s)]
*  learn whether Trump and Wicca will permit Israel to make good on its intention to prevent any new [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=928.24s)]
*  agreement so that it can escalate yet further. If Washington calls the Israeli offensive off, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=932.0s)]
*  it would be a sign it's finally serious about bringing this horrific ordeal to an end. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=937.04s)]
*  So we have to sit and wait for the, the conclusion of Trump's, the conclusion of Trump's [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=941.28s)]
*  Middle Eastern trip to see if Israel will go full scale, bloody murder, final solution, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=950.48s)]
*  and ramp up its final solution, which has been doing, or whether or not they will dial it back. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=959.28s)]
*  And then, and that will mean that Donald Trump, that will mean that Donald Trump is actually [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=964.88s)]
*  serious. The Trump administration is actually serious about scaling back Israel's atrocities. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=971.52s)]
*  Trump's tea leaves are particularly difficult to read given the erratic and impulsive nature of [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=976.08s)]
*  the man. But in contrary to January, his relations with Netanyahu have clearly deteriorated and Arab [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=979.6800000000001s)]
*  States are since Trump's unveiled his hair, brain Gaza Riviera proposal more engaged than at any [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=984.24s)]
*  point since October, 2023, not much more, but enough to place it on Trump's radar. Israel's [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=989.92s)]
*  challenges that Trump's Arab host can offer Washington a panoply of benefits while Israel [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=996.0s)]
*  can do little more than to offer to pay for the many billions of freebies it receives from us on [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1000.88s)]
*  an annual, not an ideal position to be in with a proudly transactional administration. The glass [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1005.28s)]
*  is both half full and half empty while overflowing with Palestinian blood. Call me a cynic. I think [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1010.48s)]
*  he's going to get his plane, get his one hostage to try and help his ailing approval ratings. And [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1015.52s)]
*  then he's going to let Israel do whatever he wants and pick at what's left of the bones, i.e. the [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1019.6800000000001s)]
*  Riviera of the middle East, potentially. There is also the depravity of Gulf States here as well, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1024.24s)]
*  that you need to calculate that you need to, to, to remember the Gulf States and their leadership [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1029.44s)]
*  do not care about the Palestinians. They care about deal-making. The only reason why they [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1036.0s)]
*  ostensibly care about the Palestinians is because the Gulf state populations, the Arabs living in [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1041.04s)]
*  the Gulf States do care about the Palestinians. So you're actively getting clipped chimp. What, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1046.48s)]
*  what on what? And also who cares, dude, dude, dude, I'm getting clipped chimp every day. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1052.48s)]
*  And my clip chimps are actually on ironically, putting me at odds with federal agencies at this [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1058.24s)]
*  point. I don't care. Okay. Maybe I'll get fucking apprehended and detained. Who cares? [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1064.32s)]
*  Jean-Luc Melenchon just released your interview title. The most interesting American I've ever [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1069.04s)]
*  met. Oh my God. What an honor. Yeah. Breaking news, dude, breaking news. People are fucking lying [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1072.56s)]
*  and trying to, people are trying to actively dilute my perspective by misrepresenting my positions on [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1080.1599999999999s)]
*  a complex subject matter that requires nuanced thinking. Oh, well, what will, once again, as [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1091.28s)]
*  always, you need to, you need to, here's what you need to do. Okay. When you see, when you encounter [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1099.68s)]
*  someone in the wild, when you encounter someone in the fucking wild, that is like, that's been [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1106.72s)]
*  diluted by this kind of thing, just tell them to watch the stream or tell them to watch a fucking [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1112.0s)]
*  full YouTube video. They will be able to understand that they've been duped pretty easily. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1117.9199999999998s)]
*  Okay. No amount of, of clip chimp is going to cause people to like, no amount of clip [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1124.6399999999999s)]
*  chimp being in bad faith smears is going to cause people to go, Oh, I, if they watch the full video [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1133.12s)]
*  to go, Oh yeah. Okay. This guy I was duped about, you know, I was lied to about this guy. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1139.6s)]
*  This morning I was communicating with a leader within the Palestinian armed resistance and he [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1145.04s)]
*  was saying, look, Hamas is taking a gamble here by making this deal for Edan Alexander, because [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1151.36s)]
*  they're not getting anything on paper in return that we know of. None of my sources have said that [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1156.32s)]
*  the U S committed to anything. And the calculus here on their part is, it relates to what I was [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1161.2s)]
*  saying earlier. They feel that they, that their best shot right now is to try to accentuate the [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1167.04s)]
*  divisions on a tactical level between Netanyahu and Trump in the hopes that Trump then will [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1173.36s)]
*  ultimately force Netanyahu to end the war. That's the gamble that Hamas has taken. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1179.52s)]
*  Their broader position is we will not release a single Israeli captive unless there is a deal [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1184.24s)]
*  that leads to a permanent ceasefire and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces. I spoke to a senior [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1189.92s)]
*  Hamas official last week about these aid plans that you're talking about. And he said, no one [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1195.44s)]
*  has consulted with us about this. We're not involved with this. And the, you know, the [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1200.4s)]
*  dime's worth of difference between the Israeli position and Trump's position on how aid should [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1204.3200000000002s)]
*  be administered ultimately plays to Israel's agenda. Now there's also discussion that there [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1208.64s)]
*  may be a summit involving the Palestinian authority president Mahmoud Abbas, who's 89 years old, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1214.0s)]
*  incredibly unpopular, is viewed by Hamas. And in fact, many Palestinians as a collaborator with [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1219.76s)]
*  Israel, it's possible that Trump is going to try to make some deal that circumvents both Israel and [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1225.2s)]
*  Hamas and Islamic Jihad and try to say, well, we're going to make a deal with Mahmoud Abbas. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1232.56s)]
*  There's a lot of complicated politics behind that. So I would say, Crystal, that what Trump is [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1237.8400000000001s)]
*  trying to do with his proposal for having a so-called NGO, which really isn't an NGO, it seems, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1244.24s)]
*  as you indicated, it's more like a Paul Bremmer coalition provisional authority type Iraq 2.0. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1249.92s)]
*  What Trump is sort of trying to do is get enough aid to say, I'm doing something into the country, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1255.68s)]
*  but not really linking it to an end to the war. Are we finishing the context puke fundraiser chatter? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1260.96s)]
*  Do you think I have time to do that today? No, not today. Maybe tomorrow if there is less news, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1265.8400000000001s)]
*  okay. Sometime this week, potentially ultimately is what Netanyahu wants. So, you know, let's see. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1271.92s)]
*  And yes, I will have Jeremy scale on again. I talked to him this morning. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1278.0800000000002s)]
*  Hamas, I think has shown an ability to really hold out despite the massive human consequences. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1281.76s)]
*  And I don't see them just folding because Donald Trump wants photo ops in the middle East. I think [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1288.5600000000002s)]
*  we're still in for quite a battle, both diplomatically and potentially militarily on [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1293.3600000000001s)]
*  the ground. Look, Netanyahu has responded to all of this in public, you know, all of these reports [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1298.24s)]
*  about Trump and Hamas Trump and Ansar, all Allah, I'm sorry. Allah in Yemen as, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1304.3999999999999s)]
*  Speaker 0.(1h 1m 2s): I wound up talking about you. When I got back in touch with the old friend [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1310.56s)]
*  people, literally just repeat points from drama, slop tubers. We'll walk them back. Once a reasonable [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1313.28s)]
*  person argues against them. Yes. Also the greatest fucking, the greatest antidote to those vicious [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1316.8s)]
*  smears is just showing the full context. Okay. That's it. You remember that. Okay. Hassan [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1322.7199999999998s)]
*  detainment. Okay. Chill. That's not what it looked like as sort of saying, well, we're going to go [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1332.48s)]
*  in and conquer all of Gaza. We're going to take all of Gaza. We're going to force the Palestinians [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1338.64s)]
*  into the South and then we're going to have to try to figure out what third countries are going [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1343.6s)]
*  to take them. So he's really telegraphing. I want to continue this genocide. The question is, is Trump [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1347.04s)]
*  willing to actually rein him in, in a, in a serious way, or is Trump going to try to have it both ways? [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1353.04s)]
*  Let it be a little bit calmer for some months. And then it all blows up again, which is basically [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1359.36s)]
*  what happened with the January ceasefire deal. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1363.36s)]
*  Speaker 1 [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1365.28s)]
*  As far as my analysis on like, what would be under the, the Harris administration? I don't know. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1386.48s)]
*  I mean, in terms of like a lot of the domestic affairs, yes, the Harris administration would [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1393.8400000000001s)]
*  not be as fucking belligerent as the Trump administration is. I don't think the Harris [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1397.76s)]
*  administration would be utilizing ice in the way that like, like, I don't think I'd be detained. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1401.68s)]
*  Actually, I don't know. I don't know if I'd be detained under the Harris administration, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1407.3600000000001s)]
*  but then again, I don't know. Right? Because if you look at what data Nestle was doing, [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1411.44s)]
*  she actually prosecuted American citizens in Michigan, student campus protesters and activists [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1416.08s)]
*  in Michigan, which is a blue state under a blue rulership of a blue fucking governor. Okay. And, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1423.84s)]
*  and the reality of the matter is Harris never actively said that she would take a different [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1430.32s)]
*  role and, and, uh, change trajectory from Biden on this issue. Okay. So even if she were to do so, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1437.52s)]
*  it is a major mistake that she never revealed that she would. Right. It was costly. It cost her the [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1448.0s)]
*  election straight up. So yeah, well, Biden earned the cynical take my sense is he wanted to ceasefire [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1455.52s)]
*  after may 20, 24, far too late to his outdated ideological hide bound view of the politics of [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1461.76s)]
*  the region kept them from imposing necessary pressure on any how to get it. Like Matt does [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1466.16s)]
*  is being far too nice to the Biden admin here. I don't think he fucking ever was serious about [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1469.76s)]
*  this. Okay. Never forget that the Democrats actively handed the keys to the fucking castle [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1473.92s)]
*  to this like incompetent fascist administration because how, because of how much they wanted [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1479.2s)]
*  Israel to keep doing death and destruction. Do you get deported now? No, dude. I'm an American [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1485.76s)]
*  citizen. The fuck do you mean? Where am I going to get deported to New Jersey? Yeah. They actively [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1491.6000000000001s)]
*  lied to the American population to make it seem like they were working tirelessly around the clock [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1495.92s)]
*  for a fucking ceasefire. When in fact, new reporting on the matter from Israeli, from the [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1500.72s)]
*  Israeli side shows that that wasn't the case. Okay. So yeah, this is directly from the mouth [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1504.88s)]
*  of Hamas. This step comes after important context in which Hamas demonstrated positivity and high [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1511.92s)]
*  flexibility. We affirm that serious and responsible negotiations as she results in the release of [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1516.4s)]
*  prisoners. However, continuing the aggression prolongs their suffering and may kill them. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1521.76s)]
*  We affirm the movement's readiness to immediately begin negotiations to reach a comprehensive and [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1525.44s)]
*  sustainable ceasefire agreement, including the withdrawal of the occupation army and the end [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1529.04s)]
*  of the siege, a prisoner exchange and the reconstruction of the Gaza strip. We urge the [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1533.76s)]
*  Trump administration to continue its efforts to end this brutal war waged by the war criminal [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1537.52s)]
*  Netanyahu against children, women, and the defensive civilians in the Gaza strip, Islamic [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1541.68s)]
*  resistance movement Hamas. So their statement was basically that we did this, we did this in, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1545.76s)]
*  in good faith. We did a good faith hostage release because America kickstarted the, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1552.24s)]
*  the negotiations. So, you know, who knows, but I do like that. E.L. Yakoby is pissed. The people [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1557.44s)]
*  who obsess over AIPAC every day are suddenly silent on this. I support president Trump, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1565.36s)]
*  but if his report, if this report is true, I'm deeply disappointed. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1569.2s)]
*  Cutter isn't an ally. They're jihadist and designer suits who helped nine 11 masterminds evade us [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1572.0s)]
*  justice. Bro. Here's what I don't understand. Like Saudi Arabia is a valuable ally to Israel. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1576.72s)]
*  Like they literally did nine 11. You know what I mean? I don't see you having this kind of smoke [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1583.92s)]
*  for Saudi Arabia for some fucking weird reason. You know, also whenever people try to play fast [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1588.72s)]
*  and lose with Farah designations, remind them that the reason why the, the Israeli foreign [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1595.28s)]
*  contributions do not show up in the same way that foreign lobbying money shows up for cutter, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1601.92s)]
*  for example, is because Israel doesn't have that Farah designation. Pro Israel groups can operate [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1607.2s)]
*  inside of us boundaries without registering as foreign agents. That is the reality. Okay. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1614.96s)]
*  Whereas Saudi Arabia cutter and every other country has to register as foreign agents. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1621.44s)]
*  Now, some people play fast and loose that designation. It's common practice in DC to [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1626.48s)]
*  not register as a foreign agent while still working at the behest of foreign governments. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1632.4s)]
*  They do it all the fucking time. And, and, you know, sometimes they even get popped for it, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1635.68s)]
*  but you know, please don't pick up the soap in El Salvador. Do you get deported now? If you [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1640.88s)]
*  get deported, you could reenact one piece in Somalia. Don't give Tyrone the opportunity. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1645.28s)]
*  Dude, why are my fucking haters such insanely racist people? Please don't pick up the soap in [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1650.88s)]
*  El Salvador. Don't give Tyrone an opportunity. Like, why are you fantasizing about rape? [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1656.64s)]
*  Like, why is that in your mind? Why is that like, you're such a fucking weirdo, dude. God damn. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1662.8s)]
*  Anyway, the first, the first of, for a U S the first for us in recent memory, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1669.68s)]
*  one Trump advisor described Trump's treatment of Netanyahu is one notch above his white house [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1676.48s)]
*  meeting with Zelensky and said influential mega voices have worked throughout the spring [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1681.68s)]
*  to resist efforts by pro Israel lobbying groups and neo conservative Republicans to install [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1685.3600000000001s)]
*  Iran Hawks and others seen as overly sympathetic to Netanyahu in key national security posts [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1689.6s)]
*  from the Washington post. Trump repeatedly bypasses Netanyahu stoking display among Israelis. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1695.2s)]
*  Yeah. Anyone who speaks about color this way should also sign with things to be [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1700.8s)]
*  calling for the United States. They immediately begin the process of shutting down its military [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1703.76s)]
*  base in Qatar, the largest U S military base in the Middle East. Why should the United States have [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1706.48s)]
*  over 10,000 personnel in Qatar, along with some of his most sensitive and valuable military equipment? [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1710.4s)]
*  If cutter is such an untrustworthy country, harsh critics of cutter rarely call for this anyway. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1714.8s)]
*  All right, let's move on to our big, beautiful deal maker. Once again, making big, beautiful deals. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1720.64s)]
*  Let's talk about China. Donald Trump, as I told you, he would have [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1726.08s)]
*  done big deal. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfq0d0DoG4&t=1733.76s)]
