# Israel Continues To Target Hospitals | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug)
*  Today it's called tomorrow. It'll be called something else at the end of the day as long as the occupation continues people will resist against it [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=0.0s)]
*  So if you truly want [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=7.88s)]
*  But we're back to channel for [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=14.32s)]
*  This is the the story that hour ago [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=18.22s)]
*  About the last round of bullying that Israel has conducted [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=22.16s)]
*  Almost 700 people Israel says it targeted the surgery ward at the NASA hospital in order to [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=26.84s)]
*  Senior official Ishmael Bartholomew. Yes, I covered this already [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=34.36s)]
*  He was the only person of course [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=38.16s)]
*  It was said the Israelis a precision strike, but this was a busy hospital [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=40.44s)]
*  Busy treating those injured by Israeli strikes the day before and the day before that [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  Many stuff are scared and some of them want to leave the place [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=51.74s)]
*  Because they are very scared [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=57.019999999999996s)]
*  They are in doubt that Israel will target another department soon. So a lot a lot of terror here [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=59.46s)]
*  Attacking a hospital is a unless it's being used for military purposes. For example as a firing position [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=68.1s)]
*  As Bartholomew was being treated in the hospital for injuries sustained in a previous strike [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=75.14s)]
*  Israel also destroyed several family homes in Gaza City [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=83.78s)]
*  It's not clear why and what does why mean if you've lost all your toys and books as well as your home [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=87.98s)]
*  many Palestinians believe that Israel's real aim in [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=95.42s)]
*  Restarting the war is to force them to leave Gaza as President Trump has suggested [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=99.5s)]
*  To make them go to Egypt or Jordan or Sudan or Somalia somewhere anywhere [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=105.54s)]
*  We don't need food or drink or anything we just want a safe life we want security [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=114.58000000000001s)]
*  We want a dignified life to live like other Arab people [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=120.42000000000002s)]
*  At the morgue nine-year-old Nora Nalsafi was weeping for her father in one of the houses [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=124.94s)]
*  Her grief is maybe collateral damage an unfortunate byproduct of Israel's zeal to destroy Hamas [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=135.54s)]
*  Or maybe it's the point to force the people into such despair and terror that they will go and leave [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=143.74s)]
*  Gaza to Israel's new generation of settlers [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=151.18s)]
*  And Trump with his fantasy when did they start admitting that they would target hospitals? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=154.34s)]
*  El Shifa when they claimed that there were [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=159.58s)]
*  There was like a massive test base under El Shifa [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=164.14000000000001s)]
*  the biggest hospital in in the Gaza Strip and then no one ever questioned it or [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=167.86s)]
*  rather people questioning it or just like considered completely [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=174.34s)]
*  Inconsequential and then they bombed every other hospital in the process and sieged every other hospital in the process [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=179.34s)]
*  Israel only does counter propaganda [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=186.62s)]
*  Israel only does counter propaganda when Western when the Western world actually pays attention to [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=189.5s)]
*  one of the many different unique [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=196.5s)]
*  I guess not so unique Israel only does counter propaganda when the Western world pays attention to one of the they see no reason to even [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=199.3s)]
*  Do propaganda when they blow up like the Turkish hospital for example, and then there's not enough coverage on it [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=205.94s)]
*  So just because you haven't heard about a hospital that they blew up doesn't mean that they didn't blow that hospital up [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=213.42000000000002s)]
*  It just means that there wasn't enough [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=220.06s)]
*  Attention and interest from the Western world on that issue [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=222.58s)]
*  Specifically so they didn't shoot they they didn't even see a reason to cover it [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=226.06s)]
*  That's the thing that many people don't understand about Israel's modus operandi [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=235.9s)]
*  Is that when you're hearing them even make up like make up a reason when you're hearing them make up a reason that's because [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=241.78s)]
*  there's a lot of attention on it and [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=248.98000000000002s)]
*  people are yelling them about it and they have to maintain this idea that like [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=251.38s)]
*  You know, they were that they didn't mean to do it. Yeah, like the world central kitchen situation Israel [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=256.74s)]
*  300 aid workers [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=263.46s)]
*  But the world [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=265.46s)]
*  But the world central kitchen aid workers were Westerners [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=267.46s)]
*  So a lot of people got mad about that [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=269.85999999999996s)]
*  So then they had to do a counter narrative operation on it and just basically lie [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=271.85999999999996s)]
*  This is a new Mar-a-Lago rising from the ruins [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=277.46s)]
*  Today outside Prime Minister Netanyahu's house in Jerusalem a small group of Israelis was protesting against Israel's [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=283.53999999999996s)]
*  Was protesting against his decision to restart the war and to sack officials who disagree with him [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=292.46000000000004s)]
*  It's all an attempt to slow down his corruption trial. They say [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=298.82s)]
*  The man himself did have to appear in a Tel Aviv courtroom [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=303.90000000000003s)]
*  But his testimony ended early because the doctor said he needed his eyes checked [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=308.3s)]
*  In northern Israel an attacker rammed people at a bus stop one in what Israeli police described [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=314.86s)]
*  As an attack he was seen shooting wildly before being shot himself [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=322.06s)]
*  It's the kind of incident that makes Israelis feel unsafe. So many do continue to support the assault on Gaza [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=327.54s)]
*  In Gaza they prayed for the dead Israel has people since restarting the war last week including children [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=338.90000000000003s)]
*  They show no sign of stopping [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=346.66s)]
*  Well earlier I spoke to dr. Froz Sidwer and dr. Mark Palmutter two American surgeons who are volunteering in Gaza hospitals [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=349.26000000000005s)]
*  They were both in NASA hospital last night and I began by asking them what the situation is there [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=357.06s)]
*  We know on the 18th bomb started dropping again Israel started by Gaza again. That's led to a big flood influx of [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=362.98s)]
*  Traumatically injured people and then yesterday the Israelis the Israelis actually bombed the second floor of the hospital directly [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=370.3s)]
*  They were apparently trying to somebody who does the finances for the political wing of Hamas or something [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=377.94s)]
*  They also have a 16 year old patient of mine [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=383.22s)]
*  Who I just operated on a few days before and who actually would have gone home today [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=385.94s)]
*  I was actually on my way down to the second floor ward to change that guy's dressing [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=389.78000000000003s)]
*  So I would have been standing next day and when that bomb exploded if somebody pulled me into the ICU and just asked for my [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=394.16s)]
*  Help, that's the only reason I wasn't standing there. What effect does it have on people like you are there working? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=398.70000000000005s)]
*  Well, I mean there were 25 plus hospitals in Gaza last year now [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=404.41999999999996s)]
*  There's three functioning hospitals now all the health care workers and why you see so much commotion behind us is there were [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=409.5s)]
*  less than a dozen here yesterday [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=417.38s)]
*  Israel commanded all the health care workers in the north [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=420.73999999999995s)]
*  Above the corridor to come south and so they were all evacuated. So there's no health, you know foreign health care services available [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=424.02s)]
*  In the north now so and we anticipate they'll be evacuated from Al-Aqsa, right just came from soon [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=431.5s)]
*  So but that pales in comparison to the to the reimplementation of the blockade of medical supplies [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=440.46s)]
*  Al-Aqsa is almost a functionless hospital and [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=448.38s)]
*  And that and that remaining small hospital in the north received as many casualties on the 18th spotting as this hospital [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=452.14s)]
*  What were you missing at Al-Aqsa? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=459.34s)]
*  We were missing soap. I would wash my hands in tap water [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=461.58s)]
*  before surgery [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=466.85999999999996s)]
*  We would wash the patient in tap water before surgery and even when we had beta-dine the infection rate is insane [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=468.85999999999996s)]
*  But you know because the conditions are so hard [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=477.58s)]
*  But we really have a paucity of [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=481.9s)]
*  Supplies that would make any surgery safe. We were showing people together with sutures that expired in 2017 [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=484.94s)]
*  Yeah, we are too here. So now that they have bombed the hospital in this latest round [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=491.2s)]
*  I mean, are you are you treating people wondering when the next nail is going to hit? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=496.38s)]
*  Always we came here with the intent of doing reconstructive surgery to fix the problems that [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=503.26s)]
*  The year's worth of by near of my country's bombs had done to this [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=509.34000000000003s)]
*  This population that turned around quickly last Tuesday with the severe [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=514.38s)]
*  It was mass casual the events that that froze can address better than I [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=519.9s)]
*  Mass casual events started all over again, just like last year now [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=526.38s)]
*  Before the bumping on the before the resumption of widespread on the 18th [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=530.46s)]
*  Now before the bumping on the before the resumption of widespread on the 18th [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=534.14s)]
*  We were mostly like mark said we were trying to make up for the past 15 months of injuries that needed some [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=539.58s)]
*  Reconstructive work and also just catching up on medical problems. I have colon cancer. I have gallbladder disease, whatever [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=545.16s)]
*  But obviously wasn't able to get taken care of for for so long because of the displacement in the war and the strut the starvation [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=550.78s)]
*  All the whole the whole thing now now they're back. We're back in mass casualty mode again [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=556.62s)]
*  You know, I I looked at the numbers the other day just because I was a resident during the boss a surgical resident during the boston [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=560.62s)]
*  Marathon bombing the nassar medical complex just this one hospital that we're at that has about 450 beds has about six surgeons and has three [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=565.9s)]
*  Internationals volunteering here right now [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=575.0s)]
*  We saw the same number of patients as the entire city of boston saw on the day of the marathon bombing [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=577.18s)]
*  We performed about 20. I think it was 20 or 25 operations and furthermore half of them were in kids [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=583.74s)]
*  That that was not the case in boston [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=590.46s)]
*  It's way harder to operate on children than it is on adults [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=592.0600000000001s)]
*  So the claim that the hospital is is being used by hamas. I mean you're there [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=594.54s)]
*  You know, are they there are they using the hospital as a base? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=599.5s)]
*  No, I I have gone literally everywhere at any time that I like every door is open unlocked [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=602.94s)]
*  Okay, i've been in every building. This is a three [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=607.66s)]
*  It's so insane for the record that journalist is not an asshole for asking that question. He has to ask that question [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=610.62s)]
*  He knows the answer to that question [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=617.74s)]
*  Stop chatters [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=620.78s)]
*  The reason why he's asking that question is so that they answer [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=622.78s)]
*  that question [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=626.62s)]
*  Rebuilding complex. Um, i've been in every building on literally in every room in every floor [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=628.0600000000001s)]
*  First of all again like like, you know, you can see here [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=632.7s)]
*  It's impossible to be by yourself in a room in the gaza strip anywhere, let alone in this hospital [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=634.86s)]
*  There's no way to keep secrets here. There's no way to do there's there's no way to hide anything like that [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=639.4200000000001s)]
*  That that's the the hospital is not a military a military venue in any of any sort [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=643.9s)]
*  Israel has stopped all humanitarian aid and medical supplies coming in to gaza now [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=649.3399999999999s)]
*  So what are you running out of or what are you going to run out of and what's going to be the impact of that? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFCHfraV-ug&t=654.06s)]
