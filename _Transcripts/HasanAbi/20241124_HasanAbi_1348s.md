# Why Is Everyone So Mean? | Hasanabi Reacts to Elliot Sang
**HasanAbi:** [November 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8)

*  so I'm seeing a lot of posts lately [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=20.84s)]
*  Asmongold sends his regards like this guy is like an assassin [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=23.580000000000002s)]
*  you know what I mean? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=27.0s)]
*  and it was just f**k you [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=28.36s)]
*  That's all that's all he did. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=29.72s)]
*  He said you to me. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=32.48s)]
*  Oh, no, bro. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=33.68s)]
*  Little bro thinks he's hit man. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=35.24s)]
*  Little bro assassin. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=37.0s)]
*  You know, I've been I've been sent here by the Shogunate. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=38.48s)]
*  Gay, gay, gay. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=42.04s)]
*  I think he's 12, probably. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=43.76s)]
*  But it's weird. The 12 year old watches as mingle. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=46.2s)]
*  I don't even know if this is a real as mingle fan. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=49.04s)]
*  It's kind of funny how they know you slash what you do so little. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=51.64s)]
*  Do they think this is offensive to you and not hilarious? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=54.32s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, no. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=56.84s)]
*  You said gay, gay, gay. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=58.96s)]
*  Oh, oh, no. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=61.8s)]
*  I'm I'm going to perish. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=65.12s)]
*  You could say gay twice, but not three times, dude. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=66.92s)]
*  That's crazy. I'm so fucking owned. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=70.0s)]
*  Lee about people getting meaner. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=73.24000000000001s)]
*  Like it seems like a lot of y'all have lost your manners. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  I don't know if it's just me, but I feel like in the past year or two, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=80.6s)]
*  people have just gotten like so much more shamelessly mean online. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  Like I made a video where it was just like a second a day. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=87.36s)]
*  It was a bunch of different like how I looked that day. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=89.44s)]
*  So then people were commenting and tagging their friends and just being like, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=91.36s)]
*  oh, you're the first one. Oh, my God. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  The makeup in the first one. Hell, OMG. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=95.4s)]
*  Why is no one talking about the first one? Oh, my God. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=97.8s)]
*  And so I like responded to them. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=100.48s)]
*  And I'm just like, what do you mean? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=101.76s)]
*  Or like, are you making fun of me? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=102.76s)]
*  But then they responded and they're just like, no, my God. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=103.92s)]
*  No, you're so pretty. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=105.92s)]
*  No, I just like it looks like 2021 makeup. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=107.0s)]
*  Oh, well, or like it's an inside joke with friends. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=109.64s)]
*  First and foremost, let's narrow this down. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=111.92s)]
*  Let's make this a little neater as an observation, because [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=113.68s)]
*  over the past thousands of years, people have made the same observation [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=117.28s)]
*  over and over again. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=120.04s)]
*  A paper for Nature by Adam Mastroianni and Daniel T. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=120.76s)]
*  Gilbert begins by taking pieces of a quote. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=122.8s)]
*  Bro, every dude, every video we watch now on fun day is literally like, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=124.84s)]
*  let me bring up this academic paper about neoconfusionism. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=130.84s)]
*  OK. And how the Korean interpretation of Confucianism [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=135.76s)]
*  was considered to be rather fundamentalist [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=140.32s)]
*  in comparison to the Chinese [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=143.32s)]
*  adaptation of Confucianism. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=155.56s)]
*  I like it. I like it a lot. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=157.51999999999998s)]
*  It is pretty funny, though, where it's like, let's take this back to 750 AD. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  Some observers claim that the process of our moral decline began [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=166.88s)]
*  with the sinking of the foundations of morality and proceeded [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=169.51999999999998s)]
*  to the final collapse of the whole edifice, which brought us finally [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=172.16s)]
*  to the dark dawning of our modern day, in which we can neither [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=174.44s)]
*  bear our immoralities nor face the remedies needed to cure them. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=176.92s)]
*  Then the two authors reveal the origin of this quote [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=179.44s)]
*  from 2000 years ago from the historian Levy, who was bemoaning [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=182.04s)]
*  the declining morality of his fellow. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=184.76s)]
*  Bro, he went back even further. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=186.12s)]
*  Yeah. It's like, I need more context. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=189.92s)]
*  Give me more. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=194.6s)]
*  Whoa. I need 2000 years of context. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=196.16s)]
*  Bro, this is Elliott saying, of course, he pulls this shit. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=201.44s)]
*  I'm unfamiliar with this content, but I love it. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=203.92s)]
*  Roman citizens. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=206.51999999999998s)]
*  The paper argues that such collective observations have always been popular. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=207.48s)]
*  And I think this is a direct consequence of people with PhDs [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=210.32s)]
*  not being able to get like regular jobs, by the way, straight up. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=212.92s)]
*  Sorry. Arrest me, officer. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=217.28s)]
*  There are many of you in this community. OK. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=219.48s)]
*  I know exactly what's going on here. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=222.0s)]
*  I think workers go and they get educational attainment. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=224.35999999999999s)]
*  They go all the way. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=227.92s)]
*  They get a master's, they get a PhD and they don't get a job. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=229.92s)]
*  So because, you know, there's just nothing out there for you. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=234.39999999999998s)]
*  So then you turn around and you just like, write these very dense YouTube essays. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=238.16s)]
*  I like it. I enjoy it a lot. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=243.11999999999998s)]
*  Make no mistake. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=244.95999999999998s)]
*  Just submitting that coursework on YouTube. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=246.51999999999998s)]
*  And yet they're kind of hard to pin down and often contradictory. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=248.56s)]
*  For example, some surveys show that people will make this observation [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=251.44s)]
*  a majority of the time while also holding beliefs that racism and sexism [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=254.0s)]
*  are issues that have actually gotten more progressive, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=257.56s)]
*  that people have gotten more kind about or more open minded about. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=259.32s)]
*  One of the hard parts of all this, though, is what does it mean to be kind? Right. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=262.03999999999996s)]
*  There are all types of theories about that, about kindness and ethics and morality. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=265.2s)]
*  And a lot of the time when people make these assertions, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=268.35999999999996s)]
*  they're basing it off of anecdotal evidence, things they've experienced, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=270.67999999999995s)]
*  which are notoriously hard to base scientific conclusions off of. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=273.44s)]
*  What I'm noticing when people make this observation mainly is that people [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=276.47999999999996s)]
*  are observing it about social media. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=279.44s)]
*  And that's what I really think we should be talking about. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=281.23999999999995s)]
*  Why is it that it's seemingly so normalized to be rude online [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=283.23999999999995s)]
*  to extents that are quite dehumanizing and counterproductive? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=286.44s)]
*  We'll talk about this. But first, having a public platform [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=289.40000000000003s)]
*  always makes me concerned about my public safety. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=291.68s)]
*  People have the ability now with these really creepy websites [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=293.28000000000003s)]
*  to check out where you live. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=295.16s)]

*  So have you ever had the experience of seeing a person, meeting a person, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=347.76s)]
*  encountering them in real life and with their physical presence, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=350.8s)]
*  feeling some type of connection or obligation towards them, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=354.04s)]
*  even if you don't have a connection toward them emotionally or have talked to them at all. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=356.2s)]
*  There's a sense of this person is someone who exists [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=359.71999999999997s)]
*  and someone who is worthy of some type of respect, worthy of my own ethical responsibility. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=361.71999999999997s)]
*  This is something that Emanuel Levinas is kind of hinting at or getting at [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=366.0s)]
*  when it comes to his theory about the other and the face to face interaction, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=368.96s)]
*  with which he finds that ethical responsibility lays its foundation. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=371.44s)]
*  In our philosophical approach to life, it finds its basis in for Levinas, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=374.96s)]
*  the sense of corporality, is that the word, the physical element [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=378.0s)]
*  of being face to face or being in close contact with somebody. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=382.08s)]
*  But that has an effect on us ethically. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=385.28s)]
*  And this is really interesting when applied to the Internet age [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=386.48s)]
*  and the fact that we are supposedly... [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=388.88s)]
*  Listen, be normal, dog. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=390.2s)]
*  What the f**k you mean? Kindness needs to be measured scientifically. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=391.15999999999997s)]
*  I am a nerd and an over thinker, but it's too far. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=393.36s)]
*  I think he's just trying to explain [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=396.52s)]
*  through, I guess, like ethics, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=399.2s)]
*  why people don't behave the same way online as they do in the real world. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=402.32s)]
*  As connected as ever, more connected than ever, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=409.08s)]
*  and have many varieties of tools with which we can connect with each other. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=411.24s)]
*  And yet something about the anonymity, something about speaking behind a username, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=413.68s)]
*  something about not having to see a person in real life, judge them [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=417.40000000000003s)]
*  based off of either what you visually see or even if it's not something [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=420.08s)]
*  that's in your ability, being able to sort of feel the vibrations of their voice, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=422.48s)]
*  having a sense of that person's presence and their humanity. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=425.96000000000004s)]
*  Something about losing that on the Internet seems to be what motivates people to act [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=428.04s)]
*  in more dehumanizing ways. I don't know if that's true, but that does seem to be how it feels. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=431.64s)]
*  Bro, f**king calm down, dude. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=436.03999999999996s)]
*  Jesus Christ, the real Jesus Christ for 2069. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=438.0s)]
*  Shut the f**k up. I'm going to Riz Grand and I'm going to Riz your grandma later, too. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=440.96s)]
*  More than that, though, when I really think about why everybody is so mean these days, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=445.91999999999996s)]
*  I have to think about the conditions that make people's lives what they are. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=450.64s)]
*  Have you heard the phrase, nobody owes you anything any time recently? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=453.44s)]
*  How many times? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=455.91999999999996s)]
*  Ola Samvia, a YouTuber who is a friend of the channel, has a video from a few months back [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=456.8s)]
*  in which she discusses this rise of very self-centered self-help advice [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=459.64s)]
*  and the nobody owes you anything phrase, the motto, which is becoming its credo, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=462.64s)]
*  becoming something that people use to base their own self-help decisions off of. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=466.2s)]
*  And when I think about sometimes the more oddly inhumane or dehumanizing [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=469.36s)]
*  takes that we see on Twitter and TikTok about how you shouldn't date a person [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=473.2s)]
*  if they don't cover your bill or if you are in friendship with somebody [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=476.56s)]
*  and they rely on you to pick them up from the airport, that that's them being a bad friend [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=481.15999999999997s)]
*  or people who trauma dump too much or people you should just not talk to [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=484.56s)]
*  or how you should just ghost people if you don't like them anymore. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=487.15999999999997s)]
*  All these different kinds of new conceptions, seemingly of how to deal with people that make you uncomfortable. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=489.28s)]
*  I feel like it goes back to that. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=493.0s)]
*  It goes back to a sense that we don't owe anybody anything. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=494.15999999999997s)]
*  And therefore we've got to do what's in our best interest, what works best for us, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=496.15999999999997s)]
*  even if it imperils other people, even if it makes other people very sad [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=499.23999999999995s)]
*  or it makes their lives worse in some tangible way. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=502.44s)]
*  But I think we would be remiss to observe that and not think about the context [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=504.44s)]
*  of why people might be more and more engineered towards ignoring everybody else's humanity and needs. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=507.2s)]
*  And that is the fact that everybody seems to be fighting harder and harder [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=512.28s)]
*  for their own needs or desires. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=514.76s)]
*  Everybody is constantly being conditioned to try to get their attention in a place that is beneficial for themselves, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=516.52s)]
*  to try to move up the career ladder, to try to figure out the perfect work-life balance [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=521.04s)]
*  and engineer their body the right way. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=524.48s)]
*  And in a lot of cases, everybody's trying to survive or survive easily [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=525.92s)]
*  without having to think about how they're working for their survival. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=529.72s)]
*  And since the election, of course, we have seen all types of meanness online. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=531.52s)]
*  It's not a surprise when far right chuds make tweets about how your body is his choice or whatever the fuck. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=534.52s)]
*  But it's especially jarring to see the kind of switch that a lot of liberals have made [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=538.9599999999999s)]
*  in terms of how they express themselves, despite how not only rude, but dehumanizing and violence [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=542.16s)]
*  they can come off towards other people. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=546.7199999999999s)]
*  And this is where we have to talk about the post-Trump election liberal reaction from many, but not all at all, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=548.3199999999999s)]
*  to shed solidarity with Palestinian resistance, solidarity with Palestinian people, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=553.0799999999999s)]
*  solidarity with other groups of marginalized people in the United States [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=556.4399999999999s)]
*  for the purpose of maintaining their own peace. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=559.4s)]
*  I think a lot of this can be broken down at first in the Levinas other face-to-face concept, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=561.24s)]
*  because a lot of y'all talk about marginalized people and people that really exist in the real world [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=564.9599999999999s)]
*  as if they are characters in a game with whom you can simply speak flippantly, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=568.96s)]
*  of whom you can simply disregard. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=572.48s)]
*  This reaction of people wanting to go back to Starbucks and celebrate it in front of everybody [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=574.0400000000001s)]
*  and shade Arab people because they didn't vote the way that they should have voted is, frankly, it's baffling. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=577.2s)]
*  Starbucks is a company that has done so much bad for so many people, including being quite anti-union, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=584.2s)]
*  which is the source of the pro-Palestinian protests of... [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=588.88s)]
*  Okay, I think that might be Hasan Abyhead. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=590.9200000000001s)]
*  He's very good, though. This is correct. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=593.6800000000001s)]
*  Starbucks in the past year or two, because they're stomping out of their union's expression of Palestinian solidarity [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=596.52s)]
*  is what caused them to be lumped into the BDS, pro-Palestinian protests, boycotts in the first place. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=601.36s)]
*  But it's not as if that precludes them from having negative impact on other marginalized people, namely black people. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=605.12s)]
*  There are definitely incidents in which Starbucks workers have been engineered to be racist towards black customers. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=610.32s)]
*  And yet you still have certain black content creators. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=614.8000000000001s)]
*  And please mind that I'm speaking about a community that I'm not a part of and I want to be careful about that. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=617.32s)]
*  But we have certain black content creators who are using even terms from liberation struggle [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=621.48s)]
*  of radical self-care and things of that nature to dispel this notion that they should care at all for Palestinians, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=625.04s)]
*  that they should care at all for boycotting a brand such as Starbucks, that they should put their comfort [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=629.84s)]
*  and their enjoyment of Starbucks first when it comes to, I don't know, how they engage in the world. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=634.16s)]
*  Yeah. The best, the best antidote to this was basically Americans. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=655.0s)]
*  The only way Americans actually do protests in any direction is by just consuming more product. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=678.48s)]
*  Like it's literally like, Oh yeah, this is my radical act of protest against, I guess the, the, the people that I've imagined [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=684.2s)]
*  have wronged me somehow by, you know, imaginary people not voting for Kamala Harris after Kamala Harris openly said like, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=692.0s)]
*  you know, that she doesn't want their vote with the campaign. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=700.76s)]
*  I'm going to now do a radical act of protest by chugging this Frappuccino explain protesting in terms of burger. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=705.08s)]
*  That's all it is. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=711.56s)]
*  Left out addressing the overwhelming majority of folks who voted for him, which includes white men and white women. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=713.0s)]
*  Between that or between the jokes slash not jokes of people calling ICE to deport Latinos who... [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=717.16s)]
*  I hate, oh God, I hated that so much. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=723.2s)]
*  ...they perceive have voted for Trump. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=725.32s)]
*  It's not giving. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=726.76s)]
*  Folks have become indoctrinated and infatuated by a concept of self-help that means writ large, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=727.6s)]
*  helping the self at the expense of perceived inferior others. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=731.5600000000001s)]
*  And if you ask me, this is what explains the rise of self-help content all over the political spectrum. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=734.08s)]
*  From your Andrew Tate's to your Hamza's to your Gary V's to your West Four V's to your Wizard Liz's and the like, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=738.36s)]
*  which is not to say that all self-help content is bad or can be compared equally, right? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=742.96s)]
*  Obviously, the Wizard Liz isn't as bad as Andrew Tate. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=746.48s)]
*  But I do think much of this content and let's think about the contents, the messages rather than just ideas of the people. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=748.1600000000001s)]
*  Much of the content shares that ideological similarity. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=752.6400000000001s)]
*  Put yourself first. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=755.0400000000001s)]
*  Stop caring so much about other people. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=756.12s)]
*  Stop trying to help other people. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=757.72s)]
*  Stop trying to fit that mold of what a moral person should do as society has deemed it to you. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=759.0s)]
*  Instead, take care of yourself. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=763.1600000000001s)]
*  Now, of course, self-care about self-care is something we should care about. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=764.32s)]
*  But what does Starbucks have to do with self-care? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=766.44s)]
*  Does it really count as a huge sacrifice that we can make in our own lives to boycott a particular corporate coffee brand? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=768.08s)]
*  Not even all of them? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=773.6s)]
*  Redbill content, something that we can all agree is bad, right? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=774.32s)]
*  For those of you who don't, I'm sure you're going to let me know in the comments. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=777.36s)]
*  But for the many of us who agree that Redbill content is by and large quite bad, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=779.72s)]
*  we know that this is the case because it celebrates turning people into worse people, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=782.36s)]
*  turning young men, perceivably, into worse people who care less about women, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=785.2s)]
*  who care less about the men around them, who have more hateful ideas about what a superior person is, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=788.32s)]
*  which in itself is quite linked to fascist ideologies. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=791.5600000000001s)]
*  Why are we welcoming of those same logics when it comes to thinking about marginalized people being free? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=793.5600000000001s)]
*  Liberation movements, social justice. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=798.0s)]
*  Moreover, can we really say that this world... [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=799.68s)]
*  It is the comfortable bosom of reactionary thinking. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=802.28s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=806.92s)]
*  It's just like, it's far easier to have someone tell you everything you know is right [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=808.4s)]
*  and all of your naysayers are just simple fucking haters that don't know any better, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=813.28s)]
*  or at least have some other cynical reason as to why, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=817.68s)]
*  some cynical reason as to why they're maintaining this position, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=821.24s)]
*  than it is to re-examine the way that you understand the world at all. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=823.76s)]
*  The comfortable bosom of your mom fucking got them. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=829.12s)]
*  It's like a security blanket. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=831.4s)]
*  Right-wing thinking that causes you to leave societal wrongs, societal harms, unaddressed, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=833.0400000000001s)]
*  and instead focus your attention, redirect your anger at those who are somehow even less, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=840.4s)]
*  you know, less privileged than you, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=847.5600000000001s)]
*  somehow even have a worse go at it than you, are the real villains. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=849.4s)]
*  It's so dog-eat-dog that in reality, you do have to take care of yourself first [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=854.92s)]
*  at the expense of others and shouldn't feel bad about it. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=858.52s)]
*  Is it true that if you simply shut the rest of the world out [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=860.5600000000001s)]
*  and put yourself in the cage that you enjoy being in, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=862.96s)]
*  that this will be better for your mental health in the long run? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=865.16s)]
*  Is it true that rejection of participating in everyday community and communism [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=866.84s)]
*  is something that is going to make you somehow happier, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=871.08s)]
*  that by more and more conceiving of the rest of the world and the people around you [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=874.08s)]
*  as isolating and dark-sided and wrong, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=877.04s)]
*  that that's going to make you feel more like you belong, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=879.28s)]
*  that's going to make you feel more fulfilled socially or as a human in general? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=881.12s)]
*  Does it really feel better to immerse yourself in these niche spaces online [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=884.04s)]
*  where everybody is essentially admitting that they are going to sell each other out [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=887.12s)]
*  down the river to help their bottom line? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=890.16s)]
*  People who willingly proclaim that a sacrifice of the magnitude of giving up [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=891.88s)]
*  on a particular brand of coffee is so large that they simply will not do it [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=894.68s)]
*  no matter what kind of benefits and morals that entails. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=898.32s)]
*  A lot of what we've discussed as self-care are really not self-care. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=900.44s)]
*  What we describe as self-care is actually convenience. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=903.88s)]
*  Your life isn't meaningfully better because you go to Starbucks instead of a local coffee shop. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=906.08s)]
*  It isn't meaningfully better because you stopped donating and spent $100 on a massage instead. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=909.32s)]
*  You're covering up your own melange of self-hate and hopelessness with trinkets and pleasantries, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=913.36s)]
*  but those things only seem to ease your experience for a few hours at a time, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=916.72s)]
*  a moment of enjoyment that gets sucked in hours later when you're doom-scrolling your FYP [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=919.24s)]
*  and reposting content affirming for the 500th time that you need to put yourself first. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=922.24s)]
*  Who are you trying to convince? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=925.96s)]
*  We can all tell you're unhappy. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=927.44s)]
*  This is ultimately the logic of neoliberalism. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=928.6s)]
*  It's Margaret Thatcher saying there is no such thing as society, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=930.6400000000001s)]
*  only individual men and women and families. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=932.88s)]
*  There's no one else to worry about except yourself. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=935.12s)]
*  And the true hallmark of what means to be strong is not your moral backbone, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=936.64s)]
*  your fortitude, your determination in the face of difficulty, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=939.36s)]
*  but your ability to be self-reliant. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=941.6s)]
*  And yet, self-reliance is a myth. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=943.44s)]
*  It's obviously not a thing that really exists, especially for those of us in the West. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=944.8s)]
*  Everything that we own, everything that we eat, consume, everything that we walk on top of, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=947.44s)]
*  the houses in which we live, are all constructed by the hands of people who are deeply and devilishly exploited. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=951.2s)]
*  And yet, helping them, those people that build everything that we are self-reliant on, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=956.32s)]
*  is somehow seen as something that holds us back, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=959.96s)]
*  that we are being held back just by being asked to do something. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=961.64s)]
*  Not everything, but just something. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=964.0s)]
*  Let alone the people around us who take care of us in everyday actions. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=965.6s)]
*  As covered in Claire Montaigne's The Capital Order, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=968.72s)]
*  austerity measures are passed by supposedly liberal governments in order to discipline the workforce, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=970.32s)]
*  to violently push back against people working to benefit their communities, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=973.76s)]
*  so as to encourage them to give up and only focus on themselves. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=976.4s)]
*  And when they do so, their lives still only get worse and worse. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=979.12s)]
*  It's not as if the government will give you more and more stuff just because you care less and less. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=981.36s)]
*  They'll take stuff away from you either way. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=984.64s)]
*  But you get that false sense of security in your head, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=986.88s)]
*  because you're the only person that you need to worry about. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=988.96s)]
*  And that makes it easier. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=990.96s)]
*  If the question is, why is everyone so mean now? [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=991.92s)]
*  And we are to disregard the moral panic aspect of such a question, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=993.68s)]
*  as well as to discard the fact that people have been asking this more and more, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=996.4s)]
*  as state apparatuses have grown more and more over the past thousands of years. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=999.1999999999999s)]
*  The answer at this current moment is austerity and liberalism. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1002.0s)]
*  Austerity creates the conditions which make us miserable and concerned with our survival. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1005.04s)]
*  And liberalism gives us the ideology that tells us that only worrying about ourselves [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1008.8s)]
*  in such a landscape is not only expedient, but morally good. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1012.56s)]
*  And thus you have these- [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1015.8399999999999s)]
*  What do you think all the YouTubers that talk like this are men? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1016.7199999999999s)]
*  Like I get the man is for your space, but even essays are largely men. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1018.56s)]
*  Gabby Bell, chat chat are largely comedic in pop culture. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1021.04s)]
*  There's YouTubers that are female that talk like this? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1023.68s)]
*  Swaz of working class people, and immigrants, and women across the United States, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1026.24s)]
*  that vote for a party which actively oppresses them on behalf of how they're born, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1029.52s)]
*  out of the conviction that it will benefit them as the outstanding individual. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1032.48s)]
*  And that's wrong not only because it's not likely to happen, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1035.6799999999998s)]
*  but because even if it did, it wouldn't be enough. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1037.52s)]
*  Meanwhile, middle and upper classes celebrate detaching themselves from the everyday communism [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1039.6799999999998s)]
*  that makes life bearable, and detach themselves from solidarity out of the conviction that it [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1043.04s)]
*  will make their individual lives easier, and that such a cause is just as noble as social justice. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1046.24s)]
*  We can analyze this materially even further by looking at the online spaces that we occupy. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1050.48s)]
*  Which are not neutral places, they're not life, they're corporations, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1053.6s)]
*  owned by far right people who are trying to exploit people more and more. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1056.1599999999999s)]
*  And on these websites, they set up logics that reinforce this liberal ideology, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1059.12s)]
*  this idea that simply having the best tweets will get you the best responses. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1062.7199999999998s)]
*  And so no wonder there's such a disconnect between the interactions of everyday life, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1065.6s)]
*  and the interactions of everyday social media, in that there's an attention economy, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1068.08s)]
*  which incentivizes people to write the most incendiary things to get as much popularity out [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1071.6799999999998s)]
*  of it as possible. Because we know that engaging people in rage bait, and in debate, and in [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1076.0s)]
*  inflammatory comments, gets a lot more attention than just being chill and nice. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1080.0s)]
*  And so someone like Anthony Fantano, who does seem to have a passion for the arts, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1083.68s)]
*  and espouses leftist ideals quite often, ultimately makes more money by putting a red flannel on, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1086.88s)]
*  and completely shitting on the work of artists whose work is bad enough to dismiss. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1091.1200000000001s)]
*  And we're supposed to think that he's going to exercise perfect discretion every time that he [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1093.68s)]
*  does that. I never expected to be talking about modern pop singer Halsey on this channel. Again, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1096.88s)]
*  I am a classic rock critic, I am not a fan of Halsey, I've made fun of her singing before, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1101.44s)]
*  and I know Fantano isn't really a fan either, so when I saw this new review in my subscription [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1105.1200000000001s)]
*  box, I wasn't expecting it to be positive by any means, but I was well and truly appalled by what [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1108.88s)]
*  I heard. The Great Impersonator is this grand tribute to all of Halsey's icons, because Halsey [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1114.0s)]
*  thought she was dying. They've had a terrible last couple years, diagnosed with a rare blood disorder [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1118.24s)]
*  on top of already battling endometriosis, Halsey is very sick. She made The Great Impersonator to [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1122.5600000000002s)]
*  exercise all these demons, and to leave her son something to remember her by in the event she [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1126.72s)]
*  succumbed to her illness. Once again, you're allowed to not like Halsey's writing style, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1130.96s)]
*  I'm not a fan of their music personally, but Fantano took it too far. As a music critic, I- [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1134.4s)]
*  Fantano was so fucking mean, oh he did? He cook Halsey? I don't know. Uh oh, you're getting into [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1138.8000000000002s)]
*  melon drama? Yeah, for me, I don't know anything about this, because guess what? I don't listen [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1143.6000000000001s)]
*  to music. I believe there's some courtesy you have to execute as a writer critiquing someone's life's [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1150.4s)]
*  work, and there's stuff you just don't say, like accusing a person facing their own mortality as [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1156.0s)]
*  having, quote, main character syndrome, or calling these unfathomable crushing fears of leaving your [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1160.4s)]
*  child behind, quote, childish angst. But such a system that rewards such a thing is obviously [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1165.04s)]
*  going to lead to more of that thing, even if it doesn't make any sense outside of that context. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1169.04s)]
*  Halsey makes 1010 music because of this tweet? Oh my god. She also used to date a Turkish man, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1173.36s)]
*  she's married to a different guy now, but she used to, so respect. Context. And then there's [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1179.44s)]
*  the waffles and pancakes nature of social media discourse, in which everyday people are trained [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1184.48s)]

*  we are from one another, the easier it becomes to be a fucking weirdo, a malicious, vindictive [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1286.48s)]
*  loser, desperately trying to cling onto a sense of community. What is this? [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1294.0800000000002s)]
*  And then you have this, you know? Just people touching grass and touching one another. Yeah, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1308.96s)]
*  crazy tone shift. To invest it? I'm not. I'm done. I'm done. I'm not invested in this. I don't care. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1314.72s)]

*  Gotcha drama in the Korean gender war part two we watched yesterday. I'm not going to finish that. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KosfpU5oV8&t=1334.3200000000002s)]
