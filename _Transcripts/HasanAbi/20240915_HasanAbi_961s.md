**HasanAbi:** [September 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI)
*  It's become sort of an iconic video and photo present. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=0.0s)]
*  It was an iconic video and photo. Nobody cares about it. Ah, it's like, yeah, man, maybe maybe that should have been your first indication [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=3.36s)]

*  So invested in some other does brace know this man. This man is like bizarro brace dude. He's like reverse brace [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=30.08s)]
*  He's if brace was just bad and insane [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=36.0s)]
*  Okay, attempt again this afternoon. This happened apparently over at his florida [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=39.44s)]
*  Is ryan ruth trans knows what the hard conservatives saying he's trans now. Is that what they're doing? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=45.6s)]
*  I mean, it's not this happened a little bit earlier sunday afternoon sometime before the 2 p.m [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=50.08s)]
*  Eastern hour apparently trump is fine trump's in good spirits according to senator lindsey graham [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=55.199999999999996s)]
*  He released an email saying that he is safe and well quote there was in my vicinity [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=60.0s)]
*  But before rumors start spiraling out of control, I want you to hear this first [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=63.44s)]
*  I am safe and well according to the email. Nothing will slow me down. I will never surrender [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=66.72s)]
*  I always love you for supporting me [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=70.8s)]
*  Apparently a suspect this is according to cnn who authorities believe is connected to sunday's incident at trump international golf course has been taken [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=73.5s)]
*  into custody at this point [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  A vehicle was stopped [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=83.04s)]
*  In intersection a section of interstate 95 near state route 714 in martin county is shut down apparently [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=84.80000000000001s)]
*  The allegation was that somebody actually climbed over the wall at the golf club and along was recovered [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=92.80000000000001s)]
*  At the scene secret service apparently did return fire [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=99.76s)]
*  The secret service said it was working with the palm beef. Yeah, they they they uh nuked his account by the way for the record [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  Because the american government is afraid that you're gonna you're gonna find out the truth about him, okay [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=109.92s)]
*  Yeah, account palm beach county sheriff's office to investigate a protective incident [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=116.0s)]
*  Involving former president donald trump again. The campaign has said that he is safe [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=120.69999999999999s)]
*  So that's all we know at this point. We don't know the identity of the shooter [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=125.44s)]
*  We don't know exactly what was used. We don't know anything like that [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  There are a lot of rumors floating around and until all that is confirmed [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=131.28s)]
*  I really don't want to actually say what it was that that happened [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=134.56s)]
*  The one thing that we do know apparently is that the shooter was targeting president trump [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=139.04s)]
*  This makes the second an attempt against the former president of the united states and republican nominee for president [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=143.84s)]
*  In about eight weeks, which is insane [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=149.28s)]
*  Obviously is unprecedented in modern american history this many attempts on a candidate for higher office this close together [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=152.78s)]
*  And that does say something about the environment in which we now live first of all [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=160.56s)]
*  it says does anyone even remember the first attempt I mean those of us who are on the right to because [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=165.12s)]
*  Does anyone even [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=170.4s)]
*  Stop spreading misinformation your stream says he was that oh, yeah, that's true as early [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=171.92s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of question marks. It's become sort of an iconic video and photo present [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=177.6s)]
*  It was an iconic video and photo nobody cares about it [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=182.56s)]
*  Ah, it's like yeah, man, maybe maybe that should have been your first indication [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=186.08s)]
*  Uh to to recognize that you know people hate him dude people hate him people hate him [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=190.96s)]
*  you can't like [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=197.68s)]
*  You can't keep pumping a narrative when people are just not even remotely interested in it [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=199.44s)]
*  You know president trump nearly being hit in the head by a bullet somebody behind him being leftists are the real haters [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=204.08s)]
*  I mean, yeah him getting up and shaking his fist and saying fight that became an iconic photo of president trump [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=209.76s)]
*  But it's been largely memory hold by the media in the debate between donald trump and kamala harris [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=215.2s)]
*  Who's not even mentioned once by the moderators anytime in that debate? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=219.51999999999998s)]
*  It's basically been treated as though it never happened now. We all know that if somebody had [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=223.92s)]
*  What could be what could be a a mention of the trump attempted from the moderators like what could they say? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=228.79999999999998s)]
*  Um, madam vice president. Do you consider the trump attempted photo to be iconic? Yes or no? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=236.48s)]
*  Madam president madam vice president. This is a yes or no question like like what are you saying? Like what? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=243.52s)]
*  How could that he's just so oh god. He's given up dude ben you've given up. Okay [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=250.08s)]
*  You've given up dog [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=257.28000000000003s)]
*  What kind of argument are you making in here? Like what what are you saying? Like he's not even thinking this through. Okay? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=258.88s)]
*  At least back in the day. He put a little bit more goddamn effort into these stupid ass videos [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=266.16s)]
*  Attempted to shoot joe biden in the head that would have been not only the biggest story in america that day [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=270.72s)]
*  But for all the other days because january 6th has now lasted for four [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=275.52s)]
*  It could have easily been said by the moderators. No when you are when you're conducting a presidential debate [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=279.76s)]
*  You have a bunch of obvious issues that you're going to get to [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=285.92s)]
*  explain to me [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=290.48s)]
*  how you would have brought up the trump attempted as a [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=292.0s)]
*  Moderator for abc as a journalist as a political commentator as a as a news anchor [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=296.32s)]
*  How would you bring that up like? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=302.48s)]
*  Why would you bring that up number one? And how would you bring that up? It's not even a thing trump talks about like [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=305.03999999999996s)]
*  The eye due to the attempted reform of president's life. What does this say about the political climate? We live in now [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=312.4s)]
*  Okay, but that's not even that's not about trump being from the ear [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=317.76s)]
*  You know that right and also the counter to that is not favoring donald trump because the story doesn't favor donald trump [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=320.72s)]
*  Because immediately kamala harris goes it's completely unacceptable as i've said time and time again [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=326.96000000000004s)]
*  And you know what's also unacceptable the fact that americans can just purchase it with ease without any background checks. Boom. It's over [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=333.20000000000005s)]
*  That's not a good question to ask in a debate when you got [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=340.24s)]
*  Environmental issues you got abortion you got immigration [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=344.86s)]
*  You got the economy do you understand [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=348.90000000000003s)]
*  There is a finite amount of time to ask questions and in that finite amount of time [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=352.26000000000005s)]
*  They're not gonna waste it. They're not gonna waste it with them at all [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=357.06s)]
*  What do you think about trump getting us almost is a stupid question? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=359.46000000000004s)]
*  For long years if somebody had actually come within millimeters [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=363.3s)]
*  Then presumably that would have been the biggest story in america for months on end it would have [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=367.3s)]
*  Deeply and dramatically shaped control issues are very important to be fair [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=371.86s)]
*  Wait, what do you mean? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=375.78s)]
*  They did bring up control. There was a school shooting that happened right before the debate [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=377.21999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, they brought up control a huge issue [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=382.26s)]
*  Aped the 2024 election the same thing holds true if god forbid somebody had attempted to shoot say kamala harris [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=384.97999999999996s)]
*  This would be the second time in eight weeks that somebody tried to shoot donald trump [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=391.06s)]
*  And again, this will be buried by wednesday [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=396.34s)]
*  How long do you think the story is actually going to last now? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=398.82s)]
*  They say we still don't know the motive of the original shooter [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=401.14000000000004s)]
*  It seems to me the motive was pretty clear that he wanted to shoot donald trump in the head [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=404.18s)]
*  But there's all sorts of mysterious circumstances surrounding the original shooter. Who was he we we know his identity [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=408.42s)]
*  We don't know much about his motive [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=414.1s)]
*  He apparently had encrypted phones and all the rest it's all very mysterious and all very weird [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=415.70000000000005s)]
*  We don't know anything about this shooter as of yet. We do know that there were foreign sources attempting to [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=419.54s)]
*  Create the conditions for the president trump, particularly iran [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=426.5s)]
*  There were open reports by the fbi and [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=429.38000000000005s)]
*  Ben you saw the fucking shooter dog like you think he was an iranian agent like honestly [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=432.42s)]
*  You saw the former shooter not this one [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=438.1s)]
*  But this one is really stupid, too [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=441.46000000000004s)]
*  You think the registered republican from butler was a iranian agent? Like what are you stupid? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=443.54s)]
*  Yeah, the white registered republican who was 20 years old was an iranian dude [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=450.1s)]
*  And now this time around the former trump republican who voted for him in 2016 is a registered iranian agent [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=455.78000000000003s)]
*  And the cia that the iranians were attempting to facilitate the of president trump [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=464.02s)]
*  So it wouldn't be a total tremendous shock if it turns out that somebody had taken them up on that offer again [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=468.58s)]
*  This is all speculative. There's no way to know at this point [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=473.46s)]
*  The one thing that we do know again is that if the situation were reversed it would be the center of the news [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=476.5s)]
*  They did bring out control. That's why kamala says she's gatted up. You don't remember [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=481.46s)]
*  Kamala harris was like I stay strapped, baby [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=485.21999999999997s)]
*  I always keep that thing on me. That's what she said for the foreseeable future [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=488.26s)]
*  Why because the entire narrative would be that the right had polarized american politics to the extent that it was now considered [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=491.62s)]
*  Within the norm to take a shit at a president of the united states or a presidential candidate from the other party [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=498.1s)]
*  Can we please just blow up the entire middle east off the face of the planet? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=504.18s)]
*  Please like imagine how many issues would be solved like seriously think about it. Not even in a mean way like really think about it [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=507.3s)]
*  I can't believe john bolton has a sock account, dude. That's crazy like dog. Go shave your mustache [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=514.02s)]
*  Like what are you doing? Like what the fuck are you doing in here, dude? Why is john bolton in here? That's weird [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=520.6600000000001s)]
*  This makes no sense [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=526.26s)]
*  Followings is 911 to be fair. That could be literally any state department employee. It's like [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=527.7800000000001s)]
*  The welcome back georgie welcome back george hw bush. Welcome back george w bush [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=532.74s)]
*  Welcome back henry kissinger any number of different neocons could be cheney's burner [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=538.26s)]
*  So the shoe is on the other foot now [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=543.5400000000001s)]
*  How is it that the entire democratic party can censor on the idea that donald trump is orrin chitler that he's the worst person [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=545.38s)]
*  Who has ever lived? He's the worst person in the universe a danger a threat to american democracy [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=550.74s)]
*  Two separate people attempt to shoot him two separate times within eight weeks [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=555.38s)]
*  And that has nothing to do with the climate in the country again [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=560.58s)]
*  I'm not blaming any of the people who say these sorts of things for the actual shooting the person who's responsible [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=562.6600000000001s)]
*  Is the shooter it also happens to be the case. However that in a really volatile climate [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=567.22s)]
*  If you continue to increase the temperature if you continue over and over to increase that temperature you are going to get worse and worse [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=573.3000000000001s)]
*  It's pretty funny that they have this kind of smoke for donald trump [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=580.1s)]
*  But then they like don't think about it as far as like haitian immigrants that they are regularly [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=583.14s)]
*  Uh trying to by making up about them. That's really interesting words are [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=589.0600000000001s)]
*  Words are violence you say and it like doesn't make sense for trump because the democrats never talk about trump with the actual terms [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=594.1s)]
*  That he deserves like donald trump [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=601.06s)]
*  has [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=603.6199999999999s)]
*  100 advocated for violence against his political enemies he has okay [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=605.04s)]
*  He has he's done it. He's done it time and time again donald trump has also gone beyond that [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=610.5799999999999s)]
*  In terms of like advocating for violence against like migrants advocating for violence against like different [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=615.8599999999999s)]
*  subsects of the american population [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=621.6199999999999s)]
*  He does it all the time [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=624.5s)]
*  He's motivated multiple mass shooters who have named him by name [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=626.5s)]
*  multiple mass shooters [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=630.9799999999999s)]
*  During his presidency said that they love donald trump or they used to love donald trump and now they are even more radical than donald trump [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=632.42s)]
*  Like the synagogue shooter and it's really interesting that we just don't think about that at all in this equation [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=639.78s)]
*  and that the real violence actually is saying trump is a meanie bobini if I [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=645.86s)]
*  had [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=650.8199999999999s)]
*  A fan, okay if I had as a political commentator a fan of mine [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=652.0999999999999s)]
*  Go out [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=656.8199999999999s)]
*  and actively do an act of terrorism in canada [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=658.02s)]
*  and then [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=662.34s)]
*  Mention me by name to the authority as my point of radicalization [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=663.9399999999999s)]
*  I'd be very careful about the words or violence narrative [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=668.74s)]
*  Now, of course this didn't happen to me. This happened to ben shapiro ben shapiro had a fan [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=672.8199999999999s)]
*  Literally do this. Yeah, his name is alexandre [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=679.06s)]
*  alexander [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=681.88s)]
*  bisognier who named ben shapiro by name in the investigations [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=683.14s)]
*  ben is trying to turn around multiple fans of ben and tim pool have done mass shootings and stuff, but [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=688.76s)]
*  This one straight up said his name. Okay said his videos caused him to become [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=696.04s)]
*  like [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=702.2s)]
*  Anti-islam anti-muslim you can't really point to what the democrats say in general in terms of like advocacy for violence [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=703.0600000000001s)]
*  There was a guy who worked with bernie sanders who was a bernie sanders doorknocker. He got it and went to the congressional baseball game [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=711.1600000000001s)]
*  a bunch of [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=718.0400000000001s)]
*  congress persons at the congressional baseball game [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=719.72s)]
*  He steve skliss right in the ass and steve skliss now has to piss into a bag for the rest of his life [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=722.6800000000001s)]
*  Okay, do you understand why nobody was like bernie sanders's violent rhetoric was responsible for this? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=728.44s)]
*  Because bernie sanders has never said a goddamn thing that is violent remotely [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=734.44s)]
*  Okay [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=739.24s)]
*  That's the reason straight up. They definitely did try to launch that narrative [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=740.4399999999999s)]
*  It didn't work. My point is for ben. He says violence on a regular basis. He does blood libel on a regular basis [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=745.56s)]
*  Against marginalized communities against people that don't deserve it people that cause no harm to others and people who are oftentimes in [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=752.8399999999999s)]
*  Underserved communities with no mechanism of pushback no way to defend themselves [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=759.38s)]
*  adequately and yet [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=764.5s)]
*  When those guys are victim to hate led by ben shapiro's fan base led by people who are directly in ben shapiro's audience [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=766.66s)]
*  Okay, then words are not violence. What are you talking about? I'm just doing political commentary anybody could do that [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=774.74s)]
*  But when democrats turn around and say trump is a bad person. He's a meanie bobini [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=779.86s)]
*  And he's a dictator. He said it himself. He wants to be a dictator for one day [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=784.9s)]
*  That's unacceptable. You can't even repeat donald trump's words back [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=789.94s)]
*  Because that might cause people to shoot him that's crazy [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=793.6199999999999s)]
*  You can't make this argument at quebec city mosque shooter scoured twitter for trump right wing figures before attack [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=798.18s)]
*  Bissonette also appears to have obsessively visited twitter accounts took a cross and laura ingraham fox's person as david duke [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=803.8599999999999s)]
*  The former leader of the kkk alex jones conspiracy theorist mike cernovich richard spencer white nationalist and senior white house advisor [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=809.38s)]
*  Kellyann conway bisonette checked in on the twitter account of ben shapiro the editor chief of the conservative news site daily wire [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=816.7399999999999s)]
*  93 times in the month leading up to the shooting. Yeah, I I had this tweet pulled up earlier when you're hot [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=822.1s)]
*  Low lives really shoot at you [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=829.22s)]
*  And they try hitting from every angle never let the bastards get you down [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=832.1s)]
*  He's right. Why does jd vance follow the trump shooter? He doesn't but that's really funny that you said that situations [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=837.3s)]
*  Raising that temperature does in fact become a sin when you know [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=844.26s)]
*  That things are this bad and so behoove everybody on the left side of the aisle to take down the temperature a few notches [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=848.1s)]
*  To stop pretending that donald trump is a grave [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=854.98s)]
*  Threat to the republic and by the way, they don't even believe that last wait. What the are you saying democrat? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=858.1800000000001s)]
*  Trump says that about the democrats all the time too dumb ass [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=863.1400000000001s)]
*  Like that's just politics. What are you saying? It's so funny that this guy is literally like [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=866.6600000000001s)]
*  Listen, dude [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=872.58s)]
*  It's completely unacceptable to run against the republican party, okay, like that's all he's saying [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=873.86s)]
*  Make no mistake. He is openly saying if the president gets that you can't run against him. You have to drop [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=881.54s)]
*  it is unacceptable to say you disagree with a man if he [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=888.42s)]
*  Had attempted on him last week joe biden put on a maga hat. He put on a trump 2024 hat [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=892.5s)]
*  What do you do that if he actually thought that it's not just politics. We should stop normalizing this [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=898.18s)]
*  What normalizing what two political candidates dude the extreme centrism jumped out and slapped me in the face [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=903.62s)]
*  He's like no, you're right. Both candidates should actually stop running against one another and hold hands [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=910.8199999999999s)]
*  Which low-key isn't like that far off at this point [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=916.9s)]
*  With like a couple exceptions, you know, the democrats are doing that actively [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=920.5799999999999s)]
*  So you might be a democrat trump 2024 hat were the equivalent of swastika. Of course you would not [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=924.42s)]
*  Would he really do that if you thought that donald trump was going to facilitate a tyrannical takeover of the country and end our democracy [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=929.7s)]
*  Of course not. It's all nonsense. It's all been done for political gain [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=935.54s)]
*  So again, we don't have all the details at this point. We're still yeah [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=939.7s)]
*  But when trump lies about haitians eating cats and dogs, that's not for political gain [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=942.66s)]
*  And that isn't violent inherently and isn't it begging for violence upon those people? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=947.7s)]
*  It's actually good and normal and you should say it more [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=952.82s)]
*  I'm ben shapiro [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=956.1s)]
*  Speaking of lies against the haitian community dana [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na0xRytgrlI&t=957.78s)]
