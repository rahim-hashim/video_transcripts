# Alex Jones Can’t Stop Deluding Himself | HasanAbi Archive
**HasanAbi:** [June 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI)
*  the worst information there is. So Trump says Tulsi's wrong. They're building them every [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=0.0s)]
*  time, every time he switches camera, every time he switches the camera from one hand [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=5.26s)]
*  to the other to put his hand up, to put his hand up, to go, uh, initial intelligence assessments. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=10.74s)]
*  I lose it. This is incredible. Oh yeah. This was a good take to what the are you doing [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  is Miriam paying your debts. This is such a waste. There are like 500,000 fat guys in [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=27.78s)]
*  America who make videos about the molas hate our country and Israel for free. Why the people [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=32.1s)]
*  watch you do it. You're based fed hating skit. So, sir, Israel says they're two weeks away [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=37.06s)]
*  from having him, but I'm lying. Alex Jones is a fed. He is a federal agent. Okay. All [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  of the conspiratorial nut jobs who thought this dude was not a government asset are probably [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=52.78s)]
*  still churning the same foundation for defending democracies. Talking points as Adam Johnson [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=60.96s)]
*  correctly points out when Alex Jones was in his truck reciting FDD points, talking points [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=67.38s)]
*  FDD for the record is now you're fed posting Alex Jones was in his truck reciting foundation [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=73.38s)]
*  for defensive democracy talking points. That's when I knew for certain the die was cast. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=79.46s)]
*  That's bullshit. Alex Jones is not a fed. Why does he sound like one here? Let's hear. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=84.17999999999999s)]
*  I've had enough of the ignorance. How many times have I broken news before anybody else? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=88.3s)]
*  How many times have I been right? I told you 15 years ago. I love that. He's also driving [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=92.69999999999999s)]
*  and holding his phone directly from the people that saw the evidence. He's literally holding [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  his phone using his other hand to, to, you know, speak. There's no hand on the wheel [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=104.62s)]
*  and he's driving in sent com that sensors. Let's just leave it at that that are in Iran [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=113.62s)]
*  that can drive around and fly around and scoop up everything in the air and know what level [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=121.18s)]
*  of uranium enrichment and other. He switched hands. He switched hands. He's like, yeah, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=129.1s)]
*  let me put it on my good side. Let me put it on my good side. Hold on. No way, dude. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=135.66s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. Things are enriching other radioactive compounds, fissile material. And then I make [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=141.94s)]
*  calls and talk to people over the years and they're like, yeah. Oh, he's swishing hands [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=150.34s)]
*  again. Dog, you're driving. What is going on? He just keeps no hands on the steering [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=154.98s)]
*  wheel at all. No hands, no hands on the steering wheel. My man has let Jesus hold the wheel, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=164.01999999999998s)]
*  bro. This is crazy. Yeah. How do you know that? You're not supposed to know that. No, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=172.22s)]
*  see, he put his one hand on the wheel now and no, it's not a self-driving car. He's [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=176.62s)]
*  on the highway. Every car is passing him by. He's on the highway doing like 25. Okay. Cars [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=181.38s)]
*  keep steadily passing him by and he's just, he's literally, he just keeps switching hands, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=188.82s)]
*  dude. Not even looking at the road, getting past on both sides. He's not even on the last [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=196.26s)]
*  lane for four minutes. Oh, dude. That's hilarious. So you got Netanyahu 25 years ago saying they're [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=203.42s)]
*  two weeks away. They weren't really two weeks away, but within 15 years ago, they got it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=212.77999999999997s)]
*  And now you see the CIA going, Oh, Mr. President, if you go to full war with them, they'll go ahead [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=218.7s)]
*  and finish their. Then Massad said today they're two weeks again out. So the Iranians didn't go [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=222.61999999999998s)]
*  the route of North Korea bragging. They got nukes. Dude, I hate to defend him, but forward camera [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=229.1s)]
*  mirrors the image dog. Why is his arm on the steering wheel then showing off? They've had [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=235.26s)]
*  them for a long time and people go, well, wait, you're now saying Israel should strike them or [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=241.57999999999998s)]
*  they got to know. That's why they shouldn't. The same reason we don't attack North Korea, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=246.29999999999998s)]
*  we can beat them in a nuclear war. But everybody. Yeah. Oh, I guess, I guess the mirrored camera [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=250.06s)]
*  also made the driver invisible chatter. No, he's literally driving. He's driving on the highway. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=255.82s)]
*  He's getting past on both sides by cars because he's driving slow. He's driving, not looking at [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=264.38s)]
*  the road and he's using both of his hands to switch the camera angle. And he does not have [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=272.06s)]
*  his hands on the wheel at all. He's also possibly drunk. He loses and it creates a chain reaction. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=278.94s)]
*  Tulsi's great. She's doing off the official assessment. She's got, he's only been in there, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=286.86s)]
*  you know, like 80, 90 days or whatever. And she's going off official assessment. She has [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=291.1s)]
*  not off all the hidden Intel official assessments of the worst information there is. So Trump says [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=297.42s)]
*  Tulsi's wrong. They're building them every time, every time he switches camera, every time he [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=302.7s)]
*  switches the camera from one hand to the other to put his hand up, to put his hand up, to go, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=309.18s)]
*  initial intelligence assessments. I lose it. This is incredible. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=317.09999999999997s)]
*  Speaker 2nd, 1st, and they're about to have it. No, they got it. When they demonstrated last year, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=320.46s)]
*  they can hit Israel and get through their defenses with those blitz. It means they can hit them with [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=325.9s)]
*  Israel's argument is take them out. Then, no, you don't do that because if you put them against [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=330.62s)]
*  the wall, they'll launch their atomic weapons and the Israel will obliterate them with better, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=335.90000000000003s)]
*  more high tech systems. They've had since the sixties, but it won't matter. It's like the war [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=339.82s)]
*  games movie from the eighties, a strange game. Only way to play. Only way to win is not to play. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=344.62s)]
*  Only way to win is not to play. So that's where we are. And again, this is out of control. I'm glad [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=349.42s)]
*  Trump put a two week moratorium on striking Iran. Iran's very belligerent because they can block [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=357.74s)]
*  the Shroud or Amoos and drive up oil prices massively and tank the world economy and kill [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=364.46000000000004s)]
*  Trump's recovery. So I don't know what we specifically do, but everybody should take a deep [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=369.5s)]
*  breath here that's got war fever. I just understand this is dangerous. Bannon literally doesn't brag [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=375.1s)]
*  about it, but it's admitted from sources that's what happened. He went in there and talked Trump [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=380.86s)]
*  down yesterday from striking him basically today. So we need more of what Bannon did and less of [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=385.26s)]
*  what he did. I don't want Israel to be blown off the map. I don't have some existential hatred of [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=390.46s)]
*  Israel. This is all interconnected, but I do not like the leadership of Israel in that Yahoo's in [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=394.46s)]
*  political trouble and wants to continue to use crisis to stay in power. Same thing with Zelensky [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=400.21999999999997s)]
*  and NATO and the EU is collapsed. If they want to war with Russia, the problem solves up. I don't [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=405.34s)]
*  hate the people of Europe, but I don't like their leadership. So I've been vindicated again. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=410.14s)]
*  Hopefully we got a reprieve at least a week or so, but more aircraft carriers are showing up. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=415.97999999999996s)]
*  It's crazy how people from the US get mad at Iran for being able to sway world politics. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=424.14s)]
*  Dude, this man should be worried about a different sway. How his vehicle is swaying from lane to [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=428.78s)]
*  lane on the Texas interstate. Okay. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=435.98s)]
*  Cuomo's biggest donors are cheering Trump on. These are the mega warmongers who would have his [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=445.18s)]
*  ear in city hall. When you use the wrong method, but getting the right answer anyway. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh-hseDgbLI&t=449.74s)]
