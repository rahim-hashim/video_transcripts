# Israel Just Targeted Civilian Airports Again | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs)
*  But that's how Israel operates all the time. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=0.0s)]
*  Anyway, here is a here's what's left of this and I airport after [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=4.32s)]
*  target Israeli airstrikes this afternoon, the civilian terminal [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=8.44s)]
*  was blown apart with planes burning on the tarmac. We are so [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=10.72s)]
*  used to the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=15.24s)]
*  Alright, let's get into it. Israel strikes Yemen Airport, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  but Trump says the US will stop the Houthis on the left. Yeah, I [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  mean, that is the case. Well, this is a crazy, crazy lineup. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=28.28s)]
*  Congratulations to some of the biggest weirdos online. United [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=33.44s)]
*  United front. Okay, so I yeah, yeah, yeah, it's alleged here, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=38.44s)]
*  but you provide material support to Hamas must be fact, right? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=42.92s)]
*  Yeah, of course, always. All right. All right. All right. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=45.92s)]
*  All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Let's [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=48.88s)]
*  continue. Let's continue. Let's continue. Let's continue. Let's [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=51.0s)]
*  continue. Okay, so as you guys know, I'm going to do a little [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=53.32s)]
*  bit of news, I'm going to cover a little bit of news. And then [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=58.12s)]
*  I'm going to get to the actual context nuke, which I was [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  supposed to do. Wait, hold on. Hold on one second, like a real [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=65.0s)]
*  time the dollar is raised because I need to make a graphic [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=69.56s)]
*  for this. Okay, so the Houthis the onslaught Allah movement, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=73.52s)]
*  that is the government of Yemen. All right. Right. has been [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=77.88s)]
*  militarily trying to penalize Israel for its ongoing genocide [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=83.8s)]
*  in Gaza, we will be talking about I suspect this exact thing [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=89.16s)]
*  later in the context nuke as well. But they've been doing [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=94.76s)]
*  that they've been implementing a blockade on ships crossing the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  Red Sea, seizing ships that are owned by Israelis or commercial [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=104.12s)]
*  vessels that have links to Israel or going to Israeli [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=108.92s)]
*  ports. And, and they very successfully actually shut down [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=111.88s)]
*  one of the two major ports in Israel, right. So they've been [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=117.8s)]
*  doing that. But then outside of that, they've also been testing [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=121.36s)]
*  like loiter munitions, and also hypersonic missiles, and [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=124.36s)]
*  numerous other that they have been launching in the direction [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=128.66s)]
*  of Israel as well. Because Israel is of course shown every [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=133.0s)]
*  single state actor and every single non state actor in the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=137.07999999999998s)]
*  region, that they only back away when they are met with [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=141.76s)]
*  force. Okay, this in and of itself has been demonstrated [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=145.48s)]
*  with the way that Israel is retaliated back in an incredibly [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=152.16s)]
*  restrained manner, when it comes to a country like Iran, as [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=155.6s)]
*  opposed to how Israel has retaliated to Lebanon, southern [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=159.64s)]
*  Lebanon, which has been incredibly violent, an [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  incredibly bloody affair. And of course, Gaza, Gaza, the Gaza [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=166.8s)]
*  ship that Israel is the belligerent occupier of has been [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=172.48000000000002s)]
*  completely reduced to rubble, because they are the most [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=175.12s)]
*  vulnerable, they have the least amount of power and military [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=178.68s)]
*  capability to resist against Israeli campaigns. And that is [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  precisely the reason why they get punished the worse. So the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=188.32000000000002s)]
*  Houthis, who have been struck by Israel, by the way, on their [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=191.68s)]
*  civilian airport in Zana in the past, returned the favor [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=197.12s)]
*  yesterday, or two days ago, they struck the Tel Aviv airport, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=204.28s)]
*  the Ben Gurion airport in Tel Aviv. Now, that airport, just [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=210.28s)]
*  like the Zana airport is a civilian airport, but it of [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=214.52s)]
*  course has military cargo as well. Most of these airports are [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=218.24s)]
*  dual use in that regard. But the reason why the Ansar Allah [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=222.2s)]
*  movement did this, or at least their statements as to why they [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=227.88s)]
*  were doing this is because for two, for two whole months now, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=230.44s)]
*  Israel has denied humanitarian aid into Gaza. Gaza is at the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=235.39999999999998s)]
*  precipice of famine, there are children, I believe 52 is the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=241.56s)]
*  number of children that have died so far due to famine [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=245.2s)]
*  directly. Okay, it's been more than two months at this point. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=248.2s)]
*  And it's gruesome. It's it's barbaric. It's very obviously, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=251.92s)]
*  it is a so the Ansar Allah movement came out and said, the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=256.2s)]
*  Ansar Allah movement came out and said, we are going to make [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=260.84s)]
*  it so that Israel cannot maintain, we're shutting off [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=265.24s)]
*  the the Israeli airspace, like civilian airspace. Okay, that's [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=271.15999999999997s)]
*  what they said, because Israel has been shutting off [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=277.84s)]
*  humanitarian aid into Gaza, we are going to shut off the [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=280.0s)]
*  Israeli airspace. And it worked. It actually worked in terms of [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=282.71999999999997s)]
*  like civilian and commercial airliners not coming into [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=287.76s)]
*  Ben Gurion Airport, at least for the next week. A lot of the [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=291.08s)]
*  commercial flights that were going into the Ben Gurion [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=295.71999999999997s)]
*  Airport have canceled the flights, and they are no longer [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=297.88s)]
*  flying in. Hold on, let me let me also show you the Ansar Allah [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=302.4s)]
*  statement really quickly. I think Ryan Grim had posted about [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=307.44s)]
*  it. Yeah, here it is. Yemen's military announces that in [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=311.12s)]
*  response to Israel's plans to expand its operations in Gaza, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=315.32s)]
*  the Yemenis will work to impose a comprehensive air blockade on [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=317.76s)]
*  Israel by targeting the country's airports and ask that [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=320.2s)]
*  all airlines stop flying to Israel for its own safety. Ryan [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=322.56s)]
*  Grim said, according to Israel, as quoted in the New York Times [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=327.0s)]
*  today, it is legal to block food from a population and bar them [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=331.44s)]
*  from traveling. It's not by the way, but Israel says it is. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=334.12s)]
*  Yemen now says it will shut down all air traffic in Israel in [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=336.64s)]
*  response to Israel shutting off all ground air and sea traffic [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=339.68s)]
*  into Gaza. So this is their retaliation. If you believe, as [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=342.56s)]
*  does every single humanitarian rights organization as the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=349.32s)]
*  members of the UN, as most of the planet with a with a heart, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=352.4s)]
*  mind and soul that Israel is doing a j***** side that is [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=358.08s)]
*  understandable that there would be military resistance against [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=360.92s)]
*  it, right? That's what has happened historically in the [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=363.4s)]
*  past, no matter how brown or scary or Muslim they might be. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=365.36s)]
*  These are the guys that are trying to do anything they can [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=370.48s)]
*  to stop Israel from continuously killing Palestinian children. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=374.04s)]
*  Okay, Israel, of course, returned the favor by doing what [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=379.88s)]
*  Israel does the Dahi doctrine, which is to punish population [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=383.84000000000003s)]
*  with a severe escalation of force of military force. They [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=388.40000000000003s)]
*  pummeled according to my on the ground sources, I don't know [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=393.2s)]
*  what channel four's coverage looks like, but I was talking to [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=396.92s)]
*  some people that I got direct feedback from. They there's an [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=399.12s)]
*  airport was targeted, seemingly rendered inoperable. There's not [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=404.84s)]
*  a confirmation for that yet. The Amran cement factory north of [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=410.24s)]
*  Zana was also targeted, which is a clear patent pattern forming. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=414.52s)]
*  Since they also struck the basal cement factory in Hodeidah, the [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=419.12s)]
*  country's largest cement factory. So they're basically [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=422.28s)]
*  hitting civilian infrastructure deliberately, with the hopes of [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=426.52s)]
*  destroying the country's capabilities of rebuilding. You [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=431.71999999999997s)]
*  would not hit a cement factory for any other reason. Right. And [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=436.03999999999996s)]
*  the reality of the matter is Israel doesn't even need to give [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=441.67999999999995s)]
*  a reason they could just they don't even need to say that they [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=444.11999999999995s)]
*  have weapons there, right? Like they don't even need to say like, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=446.47999999999996s)]
*  Oh, it's actually a weapons depot that we struck accidentally or [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=449.35999999999996s)]
*  anything like that. Right. They're just deliberately [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=452.08s)]
*  targeting. They are deliberately targeting areas that are of [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=454.96s)]
*  commercial importance and areas that are segments of industry [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=460.24s)]
*  that are important for for everyday existence for the [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=464.15999999999997s)]
*  civilians. It's like, it's but that's how Israel operates all [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=466.2s)]
*  the time. Anyway, here is a here's what's left of the Zana [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=469.96s)]
*  airport after target is really air strikes this afternoon, the [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=475.88s)]
*  civilian terminal was blown apart with planes burning on the [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=478.0s)]
*  tarmac. We are so used to the brought about by Israel that [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=481.0s)]
*  these kinds of images, if returned for the record, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=485.08s)]
*  considering that there is now military capability in the [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=488.04s)]
*  region to do this to Israel, I need you to think I need you to [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=491.44s)]
*  think how you would feel or how Israel would behave if this [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=495.76s)]
*  image was coming directly out of the Ben Gurion airport, not the [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=500.64s)]
*  first time Israel has struck the knock. If you recall a couple [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=504.8s)]
*  months prior, Israel actually struck Zana, the Zana airport, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=508.16s)]
*  when the World Health Organization's president was in [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=513.52s)]
*  the airport, okay, they struck the civilian airport with the [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=518.12s)]
*  fucking World Health Organization leader in the [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=522.8000000000001s)]
*  airport. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=525.0s)]
*  Anyway, maybe there were who the command centers below? Yeah, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCnx90JRRzs&t=525.56s)]
