# Trump Is Embarrassing Himself With This Parade | Hasan Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [June 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI)
*  This shit is so saucy. Look at how empty it is. He knows how empty that crowd is. He said, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=0.0s)]
*  he said, you can tell he said, Oh, that's awesome. Oh, that's awesome. Pack. Watch RIP bozo [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=5.2s)]
*  millions of people on the streets of the United States protesting Trump all around the nation. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=13.6s)]
*  Meanwhile, no one is attending his birthday party. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=17.44s)]
*  The deploy the Marines. It's time. It's time to deploy the Marines. Also Fox news. Everyone [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=21.2s)]
*  has dropped their coverage basically of everything else that's going on. It's time for Trump's DC [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  military parade to kick off. It's supposed to start in five minutes. I think I'll watch a little bit [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=40.0s)]
*  of this and then afterwards I'll head out to the protest. My town's counter protest was for [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=46.56s)]
*  church leaves a mega make America godly again flag and most of the town actively flipping them [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=50.88s)]
*  off rural Texas. Oh, it got pushed back easy to pray for the wolves of the state need to encircle [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=56.08s)]
*  them like elephants do with their babies. The boomer generation was awful. World War II ended [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=60.88s)]
*  and they didn't do anything. And now the world is in flames. Every generation after World War II [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=65.04s)]
*  has been lackluster. A military expert said that the strike on the oil depots are propaganda strike [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=68.16s)]
*  for domestic consumption. Israeli because those depots are extremely easy to repair and can be [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=72.08s)]
*  filled up again and be up and running in like two days. It's not a refinery test, but we haven't [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=75.2s)]
*  seen anything like that. They've had a, you know, a great experience here in the city. Everyone [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=80.16s)]
*  they've talked to has been very kind. And, you know, of course the U S army is a non-partisan [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=84.8s)]
*  organization. So today, June 14th, it's a U S army's birthday. That's why 7,000 of us are here. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=91.36s)]
*  Cope cope. Oh, what, what funny cope about an hour until the parade started time in DC. And there [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=97.76s)]
*  are plenty of prime viewing spots wide open, particularly towards the beginning of the route [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=104.72s)]
*  along constitution Avenue. Oh my God, no one is there. Not even the protest, not even the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=107.84s)]
*  protest. Oh, that's so funny. Oh no. When you throw a birthday party and the only people that [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=117.92s)]
*  attend are paid to be there. That's this is kind of awesome. This I'm not going to lie. This low key [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=124.56s)]
*  is the best possible thing that could have happened. Like maybe some like incredibly [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=132.4s)]
*  limited number of people. And then like some obviously anti-Trump protesters, but like overall [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=139.04000000000002s)]
*  just limited involvement is hilarious. Is it's funnier. Like having no one show up is funnier [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=146.24s)]
*  than having even only counter protestors show up to the can't even margin sink. It's so bad. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=153.44s)]
*  North Korea clear. God, we're so ass fake news. And the Pryker broadcasting service is the biggest [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=158.56s)]
*  military parade in military history. Yeah. Definitely. Piker broadcasting service does [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=174.32s)]
*  not engage or entertain any fake news whatsoever. I do not want to hear it. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=181.52s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, folks, the biker broadcasting service is brought to you by the viewers and for [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=189.52s)]
*  you, the viewers and is funded by you, the viewers, the Piker broadcasting service maintains [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=196.0s)]
*  editorial independence by your voluntary contributions in the form of subscriptions. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=201.84s)]
*  That can be $6 a month in the form of a regular Twitch subscription or a free one in the form of [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=208.0s)]
*  a Twitch prime. I have PBS logos that are meant to go on stream. Damn. This is kind of fire [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=213.52s)]
*  transparent gift. Why doesn't it show up like a gift? It's not moving. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=218.88s)]
*  Why did I just get a go army ad? Are you running ads again? No, the Piker broadcasting service [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=227.76s)]
*  does not run any ads and is funded entirely by you, the viewers for you, the viewers. Thank you. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=231.92s)]
*  Stop the fake news. This is DC today. Ignore the season. The real, this is what DC looks like [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=240.48s)]
*  right now. They're all, and I'm, I'm hearing my sources on the ground are saying that they're [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=245.2s)]
*  incredibly stoked. Oh my God, bro. This sucks so much. Oh, this sucks so much for Trump. Oh, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=250.56s)]
*  that's awesome. This is exactly the kind of petty shit that he hates too. All around the country, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=259.12s)]
*  there are millions of people on the streets from different walks of life, from different [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=266.32s)]
*  demographic backgrounds marching against Donald Trump. Meanwhile, Donald Trump himself can't even [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=272.24s)]
*  fucking get enough of his supporters to come watch his birthday party army parade. Oh, that's so good. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=279.52s)]
*  Oh my God. Oh my God. This is so perfect. I'm sorry. I know this is like kind of libed up, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=286.15999999999997s)]
*  but this is exactly the type of shit that Donald Trump cares about. And, and this is hilarious. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=292.4s)]
*  Update on the crowds from 16 minutes ago. Nowhere near nowhere near the 200,000 expected. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=298.24s)]
*  Oh my God. Millions of people on the streets, all around the nation out in protest. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=308.15999999999997s)]
*  Against Trump. Meanwhile, no one is attending his birthday party. Dude, this is, this is why I love [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=316.24s)]
*  protests. This is why I love like the liberal protest as well. This right here. Remember this [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=326.32s)]
*  right here is a direct shot at the notion that like Republicans are super popular. They're all around [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=332.32s)]
*  and that their movement is popular and everybody loves them. People think that this is the case [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=339.12s)]
*  because of what they see online, what they see on Twitter. And it ends up changing the way that [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=345.36s)]
*  they see the world. I promise you. I always say this. If you go on Twitter, you think Elon Musk [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=351.28000000000003s)]
*  is the most popular guy on the planet, right? Like, holy shit. So many glazers. I mean, there's [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=358.0s)]
*  even still plenty of haters of Elon on Twitter as well. But like, if your only assessment is [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=362.48s)]
*  conducted online, if your only assessment of the world is conducted by who you consume online, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=368.64s)]
*  if you see the giant numbers that people like Asmongold have in terms of audiences, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=374.64s)]
*  and you look at Twitter, and you see all of the half bodied, half popular support for neo-Nazi [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=381.91999999999996s)]
*  sentiment, you will genuinely develop a false sense of what the world looks like. The irony is, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=388.56s)]
*  these guys used to say, oh, we're the silent majority. The silent majority is the liberals. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=400.0s)]
*  Liberalism is monoculture. The silent majority has been, especially with the increasingly [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=405.68s)]
*  unleashed right wing sentiment, algorithm-boosted right wing sentiment that you see everywhere, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=411.6s)]
*  that's like bought into oblivion with fake likes and all this shit. You think that the actual [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=416.32s)]
*  majority population's attitude is like super pro Donald Trump. Meanwhile, the actual silent [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=421.36s)]
*  majority is the fucking liberals and progressives and the combination movement that is anti-Trump. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=427.44s)]
*  It's just that the online majority sentiment is very loud. The online sentiment is very loud and [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=436.71999999999997s)]
*  it makes you falsely believe that there's like a majority opinion there. I've been trying to explain [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=443.04s)]
*  this to people for quite a while. I think because of how aggressive right wing sentiment is generally [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=447.44s)]
*  and how aggressive right wingers are both in the real world and also specifically online with [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=455.6s)]
*  constant harassment campaigns, constant people have developed a false sense of political parody, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=461.84000000000003s)]
*  political ideological parody in this country where they actually think that the world is, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=467.76000000000005s)]
*  especially America, is way, way, way more right wing than it actually is. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=474.8s)]
*  Even people that voted for Donald Trump voted for him because they got duped into voting for him. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=480.08000000000004s)]
*  There are still a shit ton of people who thought legitimately that Donald Trump was only going to [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=484.64s)]
*  deport these like supposedly criminal migrants that are a massive problem, it seems, when no such [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=491.28s)]
*  problem really existed. This is why I kept saying this was a major gap in information from the [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=497.03999999999996s)]
*  democratic side. It was a major mistake from the Democrats that allowed public sentiment and public [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=505.44s)]
*  discourse to shift in this incredibly right wing direction and it has snapped back to reality very [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=512.4s)]
*  quickly once I started doing these idiotic and dangerous and scary operations in people's [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=518.3199999999999s)]
*  backyards and in people's neighborhoods. Open presence, thank you for the 50 big ones. Holy moly. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=524.24s)]
*  Oh my God, the protest is, or not protest, the parade has started. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=530.9599999999999s)]
*  Please welcome the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Dan Cain. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=535.04s)]
*  It's so funny and it's so ass, no one cares. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=539.44s)]
*  Joining us, the secretary of the army, please welcome the honorable Daniel P. Driscoll. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=556.6400000000001s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the secretary of defense, the honorable Pete Hegsel. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=569.6800000000001s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, the vice president of the United States, J.D. Vance, accompanied by the second [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=578.8000000000001s)]
*  lady of the United States, Ushua Vance and their three children, Dr. Dan Cain. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=584.32s)]
*  Please welcome the secretary of defense, the secretary of defense, the vice president of the United States, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=589.9200000000001s)]
*  Dr. Dan Cain. Please welcome the secretary of defense, the secretary of defense, Dr. Dan Cain. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=595.36s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the secretary of defense, J.D. Vance, accompanied by the second lady of the United States, Ushua Vance and their three children. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=602.32s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the president of the United States, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=663.0400000000001s)]
*  Donald J. Trump and first lady, Melania Trump. This shit is so saucy, look at how empty it is. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=669.2800000000001s)]
*  He knows how empty that crowd is. He's sad. He's sad. You can tell he's sad. Oh, that's awesome. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=676.24s)]
*  Oh, that's awesome. Pack watch, R.I.P. Bozo. Millions of people on the streets of the United States [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=683.0400000000001s)]
*  protesting Trump all around the nation. Meanwhile, no one is attending his [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=689.36s)]
*  fuck-ass birthday party. This is proof, once again, that the repulsive far-right hug box [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=693.44s)]
*  that Twitter and online spaces have become is not representative of real-world support [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=701.2s)]
*  for MAGA and right-wing policies. Do not be deluded. Do not be discouraged. Become undeniable. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=708.5600000000001s)]
*  Become unavoidable. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=717.28s)]
*  You will rarely see crowd shots unless it's like Trump moving into the stage, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=733.68s)]
*  and at which point you see that there is no one behind them. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=739.8399999999999s)]
*  Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=747.28s)]
*  What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=768.24s)]
*  Whose broad stripes and bright stars... Republicans are gonna be like, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=783.52s)]
*  This is DEI. This is DEI singer. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=789.6800000000001s)]
*  He looks like shit. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=808.08s)]
*  I've proved through my lies that I'm like a star. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=819.6s)]
*  Oh, say does that star... [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=829.9200000000001s)]
*  Why is he saluting? He's the commander in chief. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=834.16s)]
*  Oh, she came back twice. That's crazy. She double-tap. She hit a double-tap. Home of the Brave double-tap. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=867.44s)]
*  Wow, very tight shots of the crowd. Very tight shots of the crowd. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=882.88s)]
*  Before we even had a country, we had an army. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=887.2800000000001s)]
*  They started as a small, unorganized group of shop owners and farmers, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=891.84s)]
*  but they fought the most powerful army in the entire world to a standstill in Concord, Lexington, and Bunker Hill. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=895.84s)]
*  Then our Continental Congress chose George Washington as general of our Continental Army. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=905.84s)]
*  But it wasn't until one year later, on July 4th, 1776, that New's Iraq declaration of independence. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=911.12s)]
*  Now we had a new army and a new nation. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=918.08s)]
*  It's like probably the worst time to try to instill patriotic feelings in this country [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=921.04s)]
*  when there's so much discontent and anger, where people are like, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=925.76s)]
*  why can't we go back to the glory days? Because like right now, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=930.16s)]
*  we're in the middle of a war, and we're in the middle of a war, and we're in the middle of a war. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=933.76s)]
*  Because like right now, you're talking about the glorious past, you know? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=939.0400000000001s)]
*  Revolutionary war, taking out a monarch, like removing a monarch's grip of power. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=946.32s)]
*  Meanwhile, now all the army does is just brutalize like brown 14-year-old children, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=957.84s)]
*  so that a bunch of rich assholes can make money stealing the natural resources of said country, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=963.12s)]
*  and failing to do so in the process anyway. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=972.0s)]
*  It just sucks. What is happening with this stream? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=975.68s)]
*  What is going on right now? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=983.28s)]
*  Now. Oh, Newsom's revenge. It's not even, no, no, no, it's not. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=984.4s)]
*  It's not the, the broadcast is, I'm not experiencing outages. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=993.92s)]
*  Like the Reuters broadcast is having a hard time showcasing the parade. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=998.9599999999999s)]
*  Here, let's look at Fox News. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1002.56s)]
*  And took on the British fleet. Washington decided to make his move. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1003.84s)]
*  Our men began digging to get close to the family. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1008.64s)]
*  Families with soldiers. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1012.32s)]
*  Getting within rifle and cannon range. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1013.36s)]
*  Served in the army at the time when George Washington was the president. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1015.6800000000001s)]
*  And how for them they would have the opportunity, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1021.2s)]
*  something this kid would have never had otherwise, to see what that looks like back in the day. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1022.8000000000001s)]
*  And we see it as they progress through here. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1026.56s)]
*  This is the start of the era of what would have been, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1028.3200000000002s)]
*  what soldiers would have looked like and how they would have worn. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1032.3200000000002s)]
*  By the way, straight up Trump is so zesty with it because, Loki, this is kind of cool. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1034.48s)]
*  And this is exactly the type of shit that a zesty ass man would come up with. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1039.6s)]
*  Like they, they actually hired a bunch of like professional costume designers for the record. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1045.04s)]
*  So that they could showcase the, the costume, like the, the uniforms of every single era. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1051.4399999999998s)]
*  And I'm sorry, I like that. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1058.6399999999999s)]
*  I will admit, I like that. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1061.84s)]
*  I think it's cool. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1064.32s)]
*  But that is something that a very zesty man with a pen shot for, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1066.24s)]
*  with a pen shot for art who has an artistic vision would come up with. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1075.12s)]
*  Okay. This is where we're at clearly. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1079.92s)]
*  And of the parade really taking off here, you see some army soldiers [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1083.44s)]
*  carrying the colors of the United States and the army. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1089.36s)]
*  Also remember parades, always gay. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1092.08s)]
*  It is pride month. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1095.28s)]
*  It is pride month. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1097.04s)]
*  Parades automatically gay. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1098.24s)]
*  There is no way to make a parade straight. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1100.16s)]
*  Okay. It's always a queer experience. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1102.3999999999999s)]
*  And therefore this is technically a pride parade. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1106.72s)]
*  These are ceremonial uniforms. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1112.48s)]
*  In some cases, there are the, the, the camos of desert war time. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1114.24s)]
*  And you also get a sense of how generation by generation, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1120.72s)]
*  the army has changed. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1125.2s)]
*  It's mission of course is different in different parts of the world. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1127.2s)]
*  Hence the desert camos for certain combat that reflected that as a way of blending in. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1130.88s)]
*  And then of course the dress uniforms, all of this quite stirring to see [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1137.28s)]
*  if you're there in person and a real way to say we all appreciate the service of members. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1141.2s)]
*  7,000 soldiers are here. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1146.16s)]
*  Participating across the parade today. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1147.76s)]
*  And I think what we're seeing and I'm going to hope that the [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1149.76s)]
*  video is sort of playing in the, in a order that we were anticipating. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1152.8000000000002s)]
*  This is what you saw a moment ago, I believe was the U.S. Army Band Pershing's own as it's [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1156.5600000000002s)]
*  been become to be come to be known founded in 1922 and was something that was created [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1162.24s)]
*  under the orders of general John Pershing who commanded the U.S. Expeditionary Forces [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1168.88s)]
*  in World War I because he felt like the United States needed a band like he had seen in Europe [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1174.96s)]
*  to celebrate the work of its soldiers. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1180.8s)]
*  And that tradition has been so powerful and generals and presidents have used it to stir [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1183.92s)]
*  the emotions, to bring patriotic music to the forefront, to give soldiers a chance to be a part [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1189.68s)]
*  of important rituals that are part of civilian life. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1197.04s)]
*  All of that very important. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1200.16s)]
*  There's a combination of things happening here today too. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1201.52s)]
*  Some of the images you will see are from independent news cameras [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1203.84s)]
*  and some of them are from a production company related to America 250. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1208.16s)]
*  You see that in the upper left hand corner. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1213.3600000000001s)]
*  So there is a certain movie making quality today and then there's a news event quality [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1215.92s)]
*  to what is happening. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1221.0400000000002s)]
*  There's more people here than there. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1221.8400000000001s)]
*  Oh for sure. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1223.0400000000002s)]
*  We're taking advantage of both of those perspectives. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1223.68s)]
*  We're going to sort of listen in at different moments throughout this presentation this evening. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1226.48s)]
*  So we'll sort of stop down here for a second and let you hear a little bit of what people [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1231.44s)]
*  on the parade route are hearing as these soldiers work their way past the reviewing stand. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1235.76s)]
*  Listen for a few minutes here. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1240.72s)]
*  The 3rd Infantry Regiment is the oldest active duty unit in the U.S. Army. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1242.64s)]
*  Established back in 1784, the unit was dubbed the Old Guard by Major General Winfield Scott [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1247.6000000000001s)]
*  during a victory parade in Mexico City after the Mexican War. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1253.44s)]
*  It is the U.S. Army's official ceremonial unit and presidential escort conducting year-round [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1257.04s)]
*  tactical training to ensure the highest standards and utmost discipline of its soldiers. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1262.32s)]
*  The unit routinely represents the U.S. Army and our nation in official ceremonies, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1267.84s)]
*  major sporting events and their own, the U.S. Army's own, Twilight Tattoo. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1272.56s)]
*  The unit maintains 24-hour vigil of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier while also conducting [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1277.12s)]
*  funeral services honoring our fallen heroes at Arlington National Cemetery. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1282.56s)]
*  Why is this soxless? [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1286.8s)]
*  I think other countries that don't have much in terms of military conquest [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1289.04s)]
*  spend a lot more of their limited efforts on putting together sick-ass parades. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1296.96s)]
*  That's why our parade looked kind of sauce-less. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1303.1999999999998s)]
*  Like low-key, the shittiest North Korean parade is better than this. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1306.56s)]
*  Okay, straight up Chinese parades are way sicker than this. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1312.4s)]
*  North Korean parades are way sicker than this. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1318.88s)]
*  I would go so far as to say the Russian parade was kind of ass too. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1323.3600000000001s)]
*  I watched the Russian Victory Day parades. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1325.92s)]
*  Like some of them looked kind of shit too. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1328.4s)]
*  So I guess the more your military has actually put to use, the worse your parade looks. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1331.68s)]
*  Fife and Drum Corps that we've talked about a little bit here, and obviously they're wearing [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1336.8000000000002s)]
*  those Revolution-era uniforms as they do when they perform around the D.C. area and in other [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1342.3200000000002s)]
*  places as well. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1348.64s)]
*  The Army's way of paying tribute to those original soldiers, the first regiment that is now [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1351.28s)]
*  one that is recognized as the third infantry regiment, the Old Guard. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1356.72s)]
*  You just heard the announcer talking about here. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1360.0s)]
*  And these soldiers often participate in state visits. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1361.8400000000001s)]
*  So when the White House and the president invites a leader, it's the highest level [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1365.68s)]
*  of diplomatic honor. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1370.0s)]
*  And there's a big ceremony on the South Lawn. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1371.6000000000001s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1375.2s)]
*  Having, making, making Black Army soldiers dress up as [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1376.0800000000002s)]
*  And the leader of the Army during the revolution. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1389.6000000000001s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1392.0s)]
*  This is wild. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1392.64s)]
*  The American military is also obviously very diverse, especially the Army is very diverse [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1393.52s)]
*  now. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1398.32s)]
*  But it's just crazy to, you know, do that. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1399.84s)]
*  Make a Black man wear a powdered wig like that is not good, I think. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1405.04s)]
*  I'm proud of myself. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1409.92s)]
*  But it is so exciting to see things that go back and really remind us. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1411.76s)]
*  And we will be living, as you said in the opening here, about how next year is the 250th [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1416.08s)]
*  anniversary of the nation. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1422.0s)]
*  So we're sort of now building up to all of that. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1423.28s)]
*  And this is dramatic. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1426.72s)]
*  These are paratroopers. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1427.84s)]
*  The Army's Golden Knights, the parachute team that is world famous in not great weather [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1429.36s)]
*  conditions today here in Washington. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1436.24s)]
*  Very challenging. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1438.24s)]
*  Still making this jump to really thrill the crowd. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1439.28s)]
*  If you've been to an air show, you know how amazing it is to see some of these air performances [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1442.72s)]
*  and to see the Golden Knights parachute team jump in. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1449.36s)]
*  These are our expert parachute jumpers and they are soldiers. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1452.56s)]
*  Just to be clear, these are all members of the Army and this is what they do. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1458.0s)]
*  And they're putting on a show there, but that is spectacular. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1461.6s)]
*  I was with the president earlier this week. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1464.96s)]
*  Why do they have the Hezbollah colors there? [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1467.76s)]
*  What the? [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1473.9199999999998s)]
*  Bro. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1475.84s)]
*  It's not even Al Qassam, it's Hezbollah. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1483.52s)]
*  Bro. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1504.24s)]
*  What the is this? [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1507.04s)]
*  This is impressive to watch here over the National Mall here in real time. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1513.2s)]
*  You mentioned that, Kelly, over at Fort Bragg when 600 paratroopers came down, [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1519.04s)]
*  this has been a moment here for this White House to effectively show off the current active forces [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1524.8799999999999s)]
*  that are still very much engaged. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1533.12s)]
*  When we're talking about the U.S. military here today, [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1535.9199999999998s)]
*  you're talking about more than one million active National Guard and Reserve Army soldiers. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1538.96s)]
*  Sorry, we've seen. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1548.88s)]
*  U.S. men and women had served in are very much intersecting. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1569.52s)]
*  There's actually a new memorial that is going up slated open next year, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1573.1200000000001s)]
*  right next to the Lincoln Memorial to honor those that served in Desert Storm. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1576.56s)]
*  In many ways, I'm looking around the crowd here on the ground and you're seeing a lot of young people [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1582.48s)]
*  from teenagers to individuals in their 20s that have lived through a new generation of war in the [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1588.64s)]
*  Middle East. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1594.4s)]
*  More than two million U.S. men and women served in the Middle East were deployed. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1595.2s)]
*  There's a great many of them who are here today and this is what this moment is for the [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1602.4s)]
*  administration and why they wanted to have this event to honor those U.S. Army men and women here [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1607.1200000000001s)]
*  who have served through generations past. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1611.76s)]
*  And as you're watching these last of the paratroopers come down here, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1613.8400000000001s)]
*  those in the stands, they are cheering them on and they are watching this. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1617.2s)]
*  It's for folks to kind of have an idea. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1620.8s)]
*  You have the White House and then you've got there over kind of where the camera appears to be coming [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1622.8799999999999s)]
*  from. That camera is near where the Washington Monument is at and right where that viewing stage. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1628.0s)]
*  This is so ass, bro. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1632.72s)]
*  The president would actually be looking behind him. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1634.56s)]
*  This is fucking so ass. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1636.6399999999999s)]
*  That is where everybody is dropping there. There's been quite a perimeter here. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1637.44s)]
*  Wow, the Reuters coverage is dog shit. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1640.8s)]
*  No one's watching it anymore. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1643.52s)]
*  Those that were attending this event and this parade were here safely and securely. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1644.96s)]
*  A lot of question marks about whether this is going to take place today or not. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1650.1599999999999s)]
*  Guys, there was a thunderstorm 24 hours ago here in the area and the weather had the similar [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1653.1999999999998s)]
*  forecast and I know that some of the plans had to be called off but the paratroopers was a big [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1657.28s)]
*  moment here and something for everybody in Washington to watch with great pride as the U.S. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1662.8s)]
*  Army, the Golden Knights, the vast of them just came down here and finished their effort here. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1668.24s)]
*  What a view they had. Those soldiers who practice these drills and do these jumps prepared to do [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1674.0s)]
*  it anywhere in the world and as they were floating down to be able to see the White House [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1680.8s)]
*  and the ellipse and to know the president. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1684.8s)]
*  Iranian missiles over Iraq. Another barrage coming soon. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1686.48s)]
*  Obviously, we will move our attention away from this dog shit parade [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1694.08s)]
*  and back to more pressing matters in a moment. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1707.1999999999998s)]
*  But it is pretty funny to see how no motion the protests are. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1711.76s)]
*  How no motion the parade is versus how many people are participating in these protests. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1716.08s)]
*  I can't stop me just kind of give you a sense of some of what happened here today and you know [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1719.68s)]
*  everyone here is gathered it seems under for one issue and that is the immigration issue in ICE [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1725.28s)]
*  and so many of the signs that people were walking with and carrying through the streets of Manhattan [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1730.48s)]
*  are here. They've left many of these sites and it's so striking to see all these signs here in one [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1736.88s)]
*  place and if you look all around here you will see signs all across this park that many of the [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1743.04s)]
*  people who were marching have left behind. Are you fucking insane? Absolutely not. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1749.52s)]
*  The number one issue here today is immigration. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1757.44s)]
*  Turkey military bases here are deliberately interfering with Israeli plans heading to bomb [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1759.6s)]
*  targets in Iran. Bull fucking shit. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1762.72s)]
*  All across this country with how they have been detaining people, how they've been arresting [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1765.6s)]
*  people. That is the number one issue that we keep hearing from people today. So far there have been [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1770.8s)]
*  no incidents here. Things tend to change certainly as the evening goes on there's another protest [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1776.16s)]
*  that's just now gathering at Foley Square which is in lower Manhattan where I was a couple of days [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1781.44s)]
*  earlier this week where there have been some flash there's been some flash points there between the [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1787.2s)]
*  police because that is where the ICE offices are here in New York City that is where the detention [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1792.8000000000002s)]
*  center and that is where almost on a nightly basis. Turks always get to invite themselves [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1797.92s)]
*  into everything. No, this bullshit. I wish they were doing that. I wish they were fucking [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1802.16s)]
*  interfering with Israeli flights that are making their way over to bomb Tehran. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1807.3600000000001s)]
*  They would never do that. Turkey would never do that. At most you'll hear it from fucking fake [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1812.96s)]
*  news outlets and shit like that. Turkey is a NATO partner dude. Get out of here. Turkey would never [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1818.16s)]
*  in a million fucking years do something that is actually disruptive to Israel's interest in the [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1826.0s)]
*  region. Turkey's actions in Syria were literally in line. What is this? I do want to point out for [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1832.24s)]
*  our viewers. We seem to be moving pretty quickly here through the the eras of the US. Time flies [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1840.16s)]
*  as they say it does especially on Constitution Avenue here in Washington. We're now in the World [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1846.72s)]
*  War I era looking at some of the vehicles that were used by the army. Bro he looks sad. Bro looks [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1851.76s)]
*  sad. I believe what you're looking at there is we see some soldiers in period uniforms as well. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1859.36s)]
*  And as we say in Washington a point of personal privilege. Two Israelis arrested on suspicion [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1866.8s)]
*  for spying for Iran. Wait really? And was honored with the purple heart there so that one tugs at [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1871.36s)]
*  my heart to see those uniforms from that era. And I believe these are members of the [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1878.64s)]
*  wait they got the gay they got gay stuff on the which was at the time this is literally a pride [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1883.92s)]
*  parade. Okay abort abort abort this is literally a pride parade. Bro they got the DEI ban they got [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1889.8400000000001s)]
*  some gay shit on their on their bro this is what is happening they got rainbow drums this is [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1894.96s)]
*  literally what is what's going on this is woke the army is woke abort a. A couple of years ago [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1901.76s)]
*  where one of the major battles involving U.S. soldiers happened was able to look out over [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1908.4s)]
*  what is still untouched field. And that is where my grandfather served so that really touches me. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1913.28s)]
*  Yeah it was the great war until we had a second world war and then they became enumerated but [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1918.24s)]
*  important important history and it is true that when President Trump was in France I was on that [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1923.36s)]
*  trip with him as Douglas was referencing when they honored the 100th anniversary of the end of the [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1929.36s)]
*  first world war that pageantry done as the French can do it certainly inspired President Trump and [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1936.32s)]
*  it has been a part of his desire to see this kind of day happen in the United States even though [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1943.6s)]
*  it has not been our tradition except as Douglas indicated when a war concludes having that kind [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1948.8s)]
*  of ticker tape moment this is something different and and it is certainly taking us through history [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1955.1200000000001s)]
*  and it's also challenging some of our current thoughts about the place of the military in [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1961.52s)]
*  American life. Absolutely I believe we have Lieutenant General Steph Twitty with us in this [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1966.6399999999999s)]
*  moment he is an NBC News military analyst a former deputy commander for U.S. European command he is [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1972.6399999999999s)]
*  retired after 36 years of service multiple combat tours in Iraq Afghanistan Kuwait I could go on [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1978.8s)]
*  and on General about the work that you've done in the United States Army over the years and the [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1986.56s)]
*  the accolades and medals that you've been presented in that time I do want to first give you though an [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1993.12s)]
*  opportunity as you watch what's happening here. Bro Libaphonics literally yesterday was talking [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=1998.56s)]
*  about how he can't attend the no libs protest the no kings protest and that was of course a lie [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=2004.08s)]
*  of course he went to the San Francisco no Kings protest there was no way there was no way that [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=2011.28s)]
*  there was going to be a liberal protest with Libaphonics not in attendance. Okay I went but [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=2017.76s)]
*  I turned off airplane mode and GPS what does that even mean what you think the government is going [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=2023.84s)]
*  to come after you for going to the protest with your grandma you turned on airplane mode yeah the [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=2028.24s)]
*  government's doing mass surveillance to target the the 75 year olds the 75 year old grandmothers [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=2034.0s)]
*  what is this can you please help decipher this person's politics I have no idea what that is [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=2041.68s)]
*  yeah airplane mode does not stop the tracking by the way. After 9-11 we close our installations we [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=2046.0s)]
*  close our bases our posts and so forth and we sort of lost that let's watch her with the American oh [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=2051.76s)]
*  we can't even watch the Chinese protest let's watch a real protest I mean a parade [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=2059.84s)]
*  let's watch a real ass parade chat you can hear a pin drop [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=2064.48s)]
*  wow wow [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=2071.36s)]
*  oh [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=2089.84s)]
*  lemon fail but if Americans did this you'd all be calling them Nazis when China does it is hilarious [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=2103.36s)]
*  first of all I am pro parade I have said this over and over again it's one of the things that [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=2108.4s)]
*  like actually my leftist community gets mad at me about is my pro parade pro military parade position [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=2115.04s)]
*  also ironically enough it's actually liberals that say this is Nazi like but I guess they are [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=2120.72s)]
*  they they do say this is Nazi like and they say the same thing about Trump as well to be fair [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=2127.92s)]
*  they're more consistent I'm consistent as well but in the opposite direction I just wish that [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=2133.84s)]
*  bit more marching discipline you know so you're saying like these guys are just walking like [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=2139.52s)]
*  they're not marching they're just walking bro like look at how organized the Chinese military is [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=2147.36s)]
*  versus this they're like oh yeah all right yeah they're schlubbing they're not fully synced up [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=2152.88s)]
*  we should mention that there's some controversy in Washington DC about the weight of the tank so [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=2159.28s)]
*  they have placed metal in various corners and and intersections to try to protect [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=2164.0s)]
*  the streets from the significant weight of those tanks but when they've also put sort of rubber [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=2170.64s)]
*  yes they've added the rubber to it and it is it is quite something to see a tank rolling [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=2175.04s)]
*  and General Twitty who again I have my great personal thanks for his time and care when I [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=2180.32s)]
*  was embedded with the third infantry division 20 years ago he really speaks to the issue of [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=2186.56s)]
*  this is also a moment that President Trump thinks could inspire future enlistment like look at this [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=2192.64s)]
*  desire to participate in the army because we are in all a look at this are you kidding me [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=2199.44s)]
*  and so it is a chance to say thank you and as the general also said look at this don't have a chance [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=2207.36s)]
*  to see in person if you don't live near a base if you're not in the capital city like this you may [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=2213.04s)]
*  not have much opportunity and this is a day to take all of this in to acknowledge their service [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=2218.16s)]
*  to be reminded of all the enduring ideals and you know we're also setting it in the current [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=2223.44s)]

*  sir and when you talk about the importance of these soldiers not wanting to get involved in [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=3081.6s)]
*  politics is that an active concern even 20 of the subs our politics spill into so many parts wait [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=3087.2s)]
*  joe rogan is there i miss them now do you think that there is any risk today of people perceiving [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=3093.12s)]
*  these soldiers as being somehow a tool of the current political climate what what i will tell [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=3099.52s)]
*  you is these soldiers don't want to be involved in politics and sometimes the lines get uh blurred [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=3106.56s)]
*  particularly when you're talking about our general officers obviously it is our general officer core [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=3114.24s)]
*  that communicates more with the politicians sometimes and the lines may get blurred occasionally [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=3120.8799999999997s)]
*  there but for the soldiers that are actually marching here and operating on the ground they [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=3128.96s)]
*  so far removed from the political pieces they're focused on a job you gotta you gotta remember we [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=3136.3199999999997s)]
*  just came out of 20 something years ago and we have all kind of conflicts around the globe now [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=3143.36s)]

*  they they're thinking about training for their mission getting ready to deploy making sure that [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=3182.96s)]
*  their families are safe before deployment and deploying just like our history of our army [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=3188.96s)]
*  and winning i do want to turn back to our historian here douglas brinkley is with us [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=3196.08s)]
*  he's been watching car of foe baby they give a 20 give this perspective the context you're able [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=3200.4s)]
*  to provide on the optics of the moment we we obviously see soldiers marching here again [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=3206.24s)]
*  something that would be familiar to americans in modern times if you've been in if you live [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=3211.7599999999998s)]
*  in a military community or near a base but then we see that tank poking out here in the shot that's [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=3216.96s)]
*  on the screen now that is something that is less familiar i'm interested in your perspective on [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=3222.4s)]
*  this through the context of history well the problem with the tank um if you're just going [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=3226.7200000000003s)]
*  to cut to that image of it um for an optical point of view reminds one in canaman square with [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=3233.12s)]
*  the great protester and the lone dissident standing in front of the tank representing democracy [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=3238.7200000000003s)]
*  that's why we often what's exciting and what get doesn't isn't part of the optics is the music [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=3245.52s)]
*  i mean after world war ii it was um general pershing great blackjack pershing in the early [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=3250.72s)]
*  20s that um you know he said we got to like may they even called it you know pershing's band [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=3256.72s)]
*  really pershing's own and we started using music regularly to keep the morale of the country and [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=3262.16s)]
*  the forces up it's kind of stunning but during world war ii we had 500 army bands uh in operation [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=3267.8399999999997s)]
*  to keep soldiers morale up so this if it was just people marching in tanks today minus the musicians [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=3276.56s)]
*  you know it'd be a different feel for the event so i'm i think you have to both see and listen [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSCiwCHyKI&t=3284.16s)]
