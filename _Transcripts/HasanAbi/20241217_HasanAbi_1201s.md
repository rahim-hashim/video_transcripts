# Luigi Mangione Indicted For First-Degree M*rder | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [December 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s)
*  The idea that like people say we don't lionize is so funny because like America absolutely does that. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=0.0s)]
*  OK, they absolutely do that. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=7.44s)]
*  That's crazy. The mainstream press has celebrated and justified the deaths of hundreds of thousands at this point over the course of the past year. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=9.76s)]
*  Certainly creates this this city and the entire country. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=25.04s)]
*  It certainly breeds hostility towards progressive positions in general as well. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=29.2s)]
*  The problem worse last year over 80 ghost and ghost gun parts were recovered in Manhattan alone. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=32.96s)]
*  The NYPD and the Manhattan DA's office have been leading in the interdiction of these ghost guns. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=39.28s)]
*  And one thing I want to make clear, they are un-serialized. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=46.160000000000004s)]
*  They can be printed out. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=50.16s)]
*  But as this case tragically makes clear, they are just as deadly as traditional firearms. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=51.36s)]
*  This is a crime of priority for us here. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=58.08s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=61.6s)]
*  Finally, I know there have been questions about the extradition process. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=62.400000000000006s)]
*  The latest that I can offer you is that 41 percent of young voters find the COA acceptable in court in Pennsylvania on Thursday morning. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=65.36s)]
*  First for preliminary hearing on his Pennsylvania charges immediately to follow that will be an extradition hearing. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=74.12s)]
*  We have indications that the defendant may in which case he brought to New York forthwith. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=84.47999999999999s)]
*  In any event, we have been preparing on parallel paths and before the hearing will [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=90.32s)]
*  send to the governor of the state of New York the paperwork that would be necessary if he does not [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  waive during that that hearing. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=100.63999999999999s)]
*  I now want to want to turn over to our great commissioner. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=102.32s)]
*  And when I do so, I wanted to thank her for her partnership, not only on this matter, but [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=105.44s)]
*  on all we do every day together. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=110.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=112.63999999999999s)]
*  Good afternoon, everyone. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=113.2s)]
*  The unsealing of today's indictment brings us one step closer to securing justice for Brian Thompson and his family [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=115.28s)]
*  and affirming the primacy of the rule of law in the city of New York. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=123.44s)]
*  NYPD detectives worked tirelessly to piece this case together. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=127.76s)]
*  And along the way, the Manhattan DA's office made sure we had every legal tool available to us. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=132.32s)]
*  Bo. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=139.12s)]
*  I'm not to wear this jacket. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=199.6s)]
*  God damn, that shit is ugly. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=201.68s)]
*  And indicted for murder. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=203.28s)]
*  And let me be perfectly clear. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=204.88s)]
*  In the nearly two weeks since Mr. Thompson's case, if you see something, say something, girl, that jacket is not it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=207.04s)]
*  Social media has erupted with praise for this cowardly. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=217.20000000000002s)]
*  People ghoulishly plastered posters threatening the CEOs, other CEOs with an [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=223.12s)]
*  X over Mr. Thompson's picture as though he was some sort of a sick trophy. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=228.72s)]
*  And yesterday, sorry, yesterday, the New York Post reported that some extreme activists were circulating a deck of cards with other most wanted CEOs to be targeted for nation. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=235.76s)]
*  These are the threats of a lawless violent mob who would trade in their own vigilanteism for the rule of law that protects us all. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=250.0s)]
*  Let me say this plainly. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=259.12s)]
*  There is no heroism in what Mangione did. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=260.88s)]
*  This was a senseless act of violence. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=264.56s)]
*  It was a cold and calculated crime that stole a life and put New Yorkers at risk. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=267.44s)]
*  We don't celebrate and we don't lionize the king of anyone. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=274.24s)]
*  And any attempt to rationalize this is a vile, reckless, and offensive to our deeply held principles of justice. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=279.12s)]
*  Now, as we await the extradition process in Pennsylvania to complete, we continue our public safety work here at home. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=288.47999999999996s)]
*  That includes our focus on the growing threat of ghost guns, one of which was used in this attack. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=295.52s)]
*  The NYPD remains committed to tracking down and removing these untraceable weapons from our streets. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=301.03999999999996s)]
*  And we will do that work hand in hand with District Attorney Bragg here in Manhattan and in every other borough to ensure that those who possess, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=307.52s)]
*  distribute, and use these weapons are held fully accountable. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=316.48s)]
*  Finally, I want to again thank every member of the NYPD, uniform and civilian, working on this case. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=321.12s)]
*  Led, of course, by our great Chief Kenny, whether in Midtown North Squad, Homicide, Crime Scene Unit, Intelligence Bureau, and everywhere else. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=329.52000000000004s)]
*  All of you contributed to today's indictment and you've brought the Thompson family one step closer to justice in this case. Thank you. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=340.15999999999997s)]
*  The idea that like people say we don't lionize killers and is so funny because like America absolutely does that. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=348.64s)]
*  Okay, they absolutely do that. That's crazy. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=356.24s)]
*  The mainstream press has celebrated and justified the deaths of [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=359.59999999999997s)]
*  hundreds of thousands at this point over the course of the past year. When it's dead children in Gaza, it's perfectly valid. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=365.12s)]
*  Republicans have lionized literally in this very moment, they're lionizing the likes of Daniel Penny. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=373.59999999999997s)]
*  Openly in the same breath, they're like how could someone kill a healthcare CEO and not a unhoused mentally ill black person? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=381.12s)]
*  Like what you should just kill them. You should kill them instead. What are you talking about? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=391.6s)]
*  Like that's it. That's [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=396.15999999999997s)]
*  of course, of course every single person is like desensitized [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=398.24s)]
*  to all of this violence. There's a school shooting that happened yesterday. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=402.56s)]
*  Clip. Okay. It's crazy. It's crazy that they act like this as though all of the justification for the endless unfettered violence [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=407.12s)]
*  is not inevitably going to change the collective [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=416.0s)]
*  psychology of Americans in general. It's going to leave them desensitized the violence. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=419.68s)]
*  So the original missing report took place back [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=425.92s)]
*  in November 18th in San Francisco. The sergeant that was involved in that case reached out to the San Francisco field office [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=429.92s)]
*  and said, hey, basically, I'm working on a missing case. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=436.96000000000004s)]
*  I saw the photograph that was distributed by the NYPD. There's their bears of resemblance. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=440.56s)]
*  That tip was forwarded to us [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=445.68s)]
*  close to 45 hours after the incident took place. It [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=447.76s)]
*  showed up to a TFO, which is a task force officer. We have NYPD officers embedded with the FBI. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=451.76s)]
*  They received that tip. It was one of four tips that they had received that day and they were vetting it. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=457.76s)]
*  Part of that vetting process was that they reached out to Mangione's mother in San Francisco very late on the 7th. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=463.28000000000003s)]
*  They had a conversation where she didn't [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=469.52s)]
*  indicate that it was her son in the photograph, but she said it might be something that she could see him doing. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=472.16s)]
*  So that information was going to be passed along to the detectors the next morning, but fortunately we apprehended it before that we could act on that. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=477.76s)]
*  The commissioner has talked about how the defendant's been lionized and celebrated. I'm wondering how concerned you are about that. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=485.44s)]
*  Yeah, how are we gonna start punishing the people who are upset about health care? Can we just kill them too? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=491.92s)]
*  Can we start arresting people who are upset about their health care? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=499.36s)]
*  Which I think we put forth beautifully. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=503.91999999999996s)]
*  We see a lot in these jobs. I meet with [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=507.12s)]
*  the families of homicide victims [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=511.59999999999997s)]
*  and I just can't wrap my head around the notion that [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=514.16s)]
*  someone is celebrating this. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=517.36s)]
*  To your specific question, you know, we're [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=519.68s)]
*  at the beginning of a litigation now with our charge. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=522.56s)]
*  We have a phenomenal [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=525.76s)]
*  trial team in place [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=528.4s)]
*  led by ADA. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=530.4s)]
*  Joel Seidman, who has, you know, been in this office for more than 40 years and handled [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=532.32s)]
*  some very challenging matters. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=538.0s)]
*  We have a wide year process in place. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=540.1600000000001s)]
*  I have faith in our jury system to select 12 people who can be fair and impartial, but we'll move forward and that's something [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=543.36s)]
*  well down the road, but we'll be ready when that time comes. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=551.0400000000001s)]
*  Two questions, if possible. One over your health problem. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=555.0400000000001s)]
*  I want to just maybe explain more to viewers how you take this as an important part of this. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=557.12s)]
*  I hope you can explain that more. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=566.9599999999999s)]
*  Sure, and I mean the statute talks about [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=573.12s)]
*  intents to influence or coerce [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=576.48s)]
*  a civilian population. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=579.12s)]
*  The statute talks about [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=581.36s)]
*  intending to influence a policy of government. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=584.32s)]
*  And it talks about seeking to put forth things sort of similar to that by law. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=587.52s)]
*  So [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=593.6800000000001s)]
*  the statute, plain language, the statute is clear. Obviously, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=595.2s)]
*  we've charged it, the grand jury has voted on it, and we intend to go forward and prove it. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=598.16s)]
*  But I think it does help to take a step back [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=602.4s)]
*  and think about the proof in the case, some of the writings. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=606.96s)]
*  I'm not going to get into too much of that, but in the actual reaction, you know, in the middle of midtown, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=610.7199999999999s)]
*  the beginning of a busy day, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=617.12s)]
*  tourists, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=619.18s)]
*  commuters, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=620.48s)]
*  business people, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=621.8399999999999s)]
*  the intent [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=623.8399999999999s)]
*  was to [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=625.68s)]
*  sow terror. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=627.04s)]
*  I don't know about all that, man. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=629.8399999999999s)]
*  I'm not going to talk about communications with a family other than to say that we... [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=640.16s)]
*  Yeah, revenge of any sort is not considered terror until the revenge is conducted against a CEO, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=650.24s)]
*  a person that is of notoriety and worth in society. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=656.88s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=661.6s)]
*  It's terrorism. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=663.6s)]
*  I [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=665.76s)]
*  echo what the commissioner said and the sentiment of your question, my heart goes out to it. This is a significant piece of what we do here [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=668.16s)]
*  is [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=676.88s)]
*  we center the trauma of survivors and victims and their families. As the CEO of my own small business, Pokemon Kart, a reselling company, I am terrified. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=678.8000000000001s)]
*  I would appropriate if they want to offer a hug. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=688.24s)]
*  We have... [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=691.04s)]
*  You're joking, but like I can see that being the next step of universalizing the fear and being like you don't understand [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=691.92s)]
*  who amongst us isn't a CEO in their own way. You know what I mean? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=699.4399999999999s)]
*  Like trying to make it seem as though the the fucking mom-and-pop shop owner in your local neighborhood [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=704.0799999999999s)]
*  is a direct target of this kind of [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=710.8s)]
*  ...just as the UnitedHealthcare CEO is. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=714.0s)]
*  Like you have to understand it's the same. It's the same actually. We're all CEOs. This is a nation of CEOs. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=717.6s)]
*  We're all CEOs one way or another. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=725.5200000000001s)]
*  Yes, absolutely and and we've [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=730.72s)]
*  seen a real [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=733.2800000000001s)]
*  increase, sustained increase since December 4th in concern [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=735.0400000000001s)]
*  not just from CEOs but from corporations broadly and so going back to the DA's intent to intimidate or coerce a civilian [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=740.16s)]
*  population which is of course at the root of our [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=747.9s)]
*  state terrorism statute. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=750.72s)]
*  Even if I wasn't convinced by the killing itself the narratives in response to it would have been pretty fucking [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=752.16s)]
*  radicalizing to me seeing that the entire governments are jumping into action to protect CEOs when no such protection has ever been afforded to anyone else. Wow. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=756.22s)]
*  Yeah, but I think you have to remember [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=762.32s)]
*  the average American in my opinion is like [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=764.4s)]
*  barely servile. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=767.76s)]
*  So when they see these instruments of justice and and all of these institutions like come out [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=769.4399999999999s)]
*  and defend the the pecking order that exists like [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=775.52s)]
*  they are I think they're infinitely more open-minded to that sort of thing. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=778.88s)]
*  Like reinforcing the pre-existing constructs like they will they will be like, oh no [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=784.4s)]
*  I um, I agree actually you're right. It is kind of fucked up, you know the milord attitude. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=789.68s)]
*  Milord must be protected. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=795.92s)]
*  All the work that we do together every day. We're quite confident that concerns and threats are going to be appropriately directed our way. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=798.48s)]
*  Do you recognize how rare it is for your office to charge the first degree murder? There has been some talk about various specific cases in the map. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=808.72s)]
*  That also leads to the statements made on the record by the suspect that informed this timeline in particular. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=818.48s)]
*  So I'll address the the the first piece. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=826.48s)]
*  The first degree murder statute has a number of subsections. They're sort of clearly delineated and they are reserved for [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=829.76s)]
*  you know the most [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=836.72s)]
*  abhorrent conduct killing a police officer. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=839.9200000000001s)]
*  Serial killing and the terrorism is one subsection of that. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=843.2s)]
*  And so I would say fortunately that's not happening a lot. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=847.68s)]
*  Taking a step back. I don't I can't think of another office that is [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=852.9599999999999s)]
*  more equipped to handle a terrorism charge. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=857.76s)]
*  We have a great terrorism unit. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=860.64s)]
*  The forefront of getting the statute passed. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=864.88s)]
*  Within the last two years we've tried [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=869.04s)]
*  two very significant [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=872.7199999999999s)]
*  terrorism cases. One involving an English-speaking operative based in Jamaica. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=874.8000000000001s)]
*  And another involving someone who was here [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=880.64s)]
*  and funding [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=884.64s)]
*  overseas terrorism by cryptocurrency. So we have the expertise and as I mentioned the [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=886.24s)]
*  expertise on this team. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=893.44s)]
*  And so we're prepared to go forward. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=895.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not going to go beyond what's in the filing. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=898.72s)]
*  All right, last question. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=901.68s)]
*  So as a matter of practice, I don't talk about sentencing outside of court as a first matter and certainly not [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=909.12s)]
*  at the initial stages of a matter. But I think you can tell the seriousness with which we take this matter [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=915.04s)]
*  by the way in which it's charged. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=921.6s)]
*  The murder in the second degree actually has a mandatory life without a parole sentence. No discretion for the judge. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=924.0s)]
*  At all. So that's the maximum there. But I'm not going to go beyond that. We will first [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=931.8399999999999s)]
*  get the defendant to the audio shit in these meetings because they have to open up the boom mic [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=936.9599999999999s)]
*  so that they can hear the random journalist and then go back to the individual. That's why it's bad equipped to do that. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=941.92s)]
*  And then [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=948.8s)]
*  we will proceed to send this in which one will make our arguments in court. Thank you all so much. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=950.0s)]
*  Someone in the chat brought forward a really interesting point, but yeah, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=956.48s)]
*  Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg hates [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=960.24s)]
*  Luigi seemingly more than he hates Donald Trump and his prosecution of Donald Trump got him an endless sea of death threats. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=963.92s)]
*  That should tell you everything you need to know about those in positions of power under liberal capitalist democracy. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=972.72s)]
*  Okay, like he literally he's just like, oh I can't wait to get this scumbag. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=979.4399999999999s)]
*  This terrorist scumbag off the streets. It's like that's it. Someone's thinking some crack in the video camera. So Joel, pardon him. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=985.12s)]
*  Yeah, no, someone needs to tell Joe that Luigi is his son. The police commissioner is the daughter of a billionaire. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=991.84s)]
*  He was the CEO of Lowe's Group. Now her brother is CEO and they have their health insurance with United Health Care. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=996.5600000000001s)]
*  I did not know that. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1001.44s)]
*  But it's not shocking to me. He would be a terrorist if he had killed civilians, but literally went out of his way to avoid harming civilians. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1003.04s)]
*  Yeah, terrorism as a political designation [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1008.72s)]
*  has no real [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1011.9200000000001s)]
*  values associated with it. It's just something that you declare [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1014.0799999999999s)]
*  specifically to to vilify whoever the fuck you're prosecuting. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1019.02s)]
*  That's why Nelson Mandela was considered a terrorist until 2008. He was on the terror watch list until 2008. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1022.8s)]
*  It just means that you're outside of the [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1029.2s)]
*  you're you're against the the preordained the preordained hierarchies that the state wants to [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1032.08s)]
*  justify that the state wants to uphold. There's a reason why you rarely ever see that designation [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1038.3200000000002s)]
*  for white supremacists. Okay, if you want to have like a universal approach to it, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1044.3200000000002s)]
*  I think the the the best possible universal approach to it would be people who go out of their way to create [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1050.0s)]
*  to go out of their way to create a sense of panic upon the public for political purpose or not [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1058.48s)]
*  by directly targeting [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1064.16s)]
*  majority civilians. Okay, like that is what [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1066.16s)]
*  the universal application of that would be, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1072.72s)]
*  which would put America as the top terrorist on the planet. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1075.6000000000001s)]
*  Israel would be a massive terrorist. Russia would be a terrorist as well. All these states would be considered most states would be considered [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1078.5600000000002s)]
*  terrorist. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1085.74s)]
*  So it doesn't really make sense that way, which is why there is no real universal application for it and rather [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1086.8000000000002s)]
*  you have these [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1093.52s)]
*  these applications on non-state actors usually, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1095.12s)]
*  right? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1098.32s)]
*  If you strap a suicide vest [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1099.6s)]
*  onto your body and blow up a hospital, you're understandably called a terrorist. If you blow up that hospital [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1102.56s)]
*  with a drone strike, you're called Barack Hussein Obama, recipient of a Nobel Peace Prize. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1109.28s)]
*  Do you understand the difference there? Bro, they are going to ban you. What are you guys saying? I'm talking about [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1116.7199999999998s)]
*  what am I not supposed to talk about like the [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1122.88s)]
*  designation of terrorism? Like what are we doing here? [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1126.5600000000002s)]
*  What this is like people always people always turn around and they're like, oh dude free speech, whatever and it's like [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1129.28s)]
*  Of course you insult the black president law. Wait, what you hate Kamala more than you hate Trump and that tells me everything [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1135.8400000000001s)]
*  I need to know about you. Oh like you another rich kid cosplaying as a leftist. Don't talk about Nelson Mandela [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1140.96s)]
*  His name shouldn't come out of your mouth. Are you okay? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1146.0s)]
*  All right, you know what? I got it [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1149.28s)]
*  Woke of the day award goes to trey jostlin runnels [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1152.08s)]
*  Congratulations chatter. You are the woke of the day [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1157.26s)]
*  Of course you insult the black president. Yeah. Yeah, my criticisms of barack obama have [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1160.96s)]
*  Have nothing to do with him being black. I don't know how you can't factor that in [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1167.04s)]
*  Well, how did blackness factor into him? Uh bombing kunduz hospital? [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1171.6s)]
*  You think you think that was a you think that was a prominent factor [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1176.56s)]
*  You think that had anything to do with my criticisms of barack obama? [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1179.9199999999998s)]
*  Do you have an answer to this or are you just here to cry? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1182.6399999999999s)]
*  You're just citing critical terrorism studies to be honest. This is an entire field of study [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1185.28s)]
*  No reason to ban you or anything people should start reading more. I know but like it doesn't really matter [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1188.7199999999998s)]
*  What happened? Why did these guys stop talking? [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdT4TtaEu_s&t=1193.12s)]
