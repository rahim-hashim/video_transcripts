# Houthis Are Just Fighting Back Against Israel | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [May 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE)
*  Like that doesn't make any sense. Like that literally doesn't make sense. You're like, okay, they're doing it, but you don't want anyone to resist against it. And you will spend a good deal of time criticizing the ways in which like the Houthis have have tried to incur penalties that try to create penalties on Israel for doing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=0.0s)]
*  Would you say your notorious shared ability has to stop before he will get you into real harm and tar communities are practically calling for your arrest while yours are just off to the latest armpit screenshot or whatever? What? No, I'm in the business of trying listen chatters. I need you to understand something. Okay, if you get in the pigsty, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=17.8s)]
*  and you wrestle with pigs, you're gonna get shit all over yourself. And the pigs gonna like it. Okay. And that in and of itself was a perfect demonstration of the back and forth that took place this past Friday. I have been relentlessly attacked in perpetuity by a political content creators liberals that don't like my foreign policy perspective liberals that don't like my criticisms of the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=47.839999999999996s)]
*  Kamala Harris campaign or the branded administration and the entirety of the right wing people who love Donald Trump. Nazis, a political people that present themselves as a political centrist even though they're very far right. I've I have had I've duked it out with every single type of content creator that has ever broached [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=77.56s)]
*  politics, right? I am seen as a I am seen as a beacon for leftism for better or for worse. It's not something that I wanted to be seen as. But it is something that I am seen as and in a world where a lot of people are hostile to leftist values leftist ideology leftist statements. They just basically try to undermine the messenger instead of tackling the message to the best of their ability. There's a lot of shit stirring that goes on. Right? That's precisely the reason why I'm saying this. I'm not saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that I [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=100.24s)]
*  know one makes the argument or no one tries to tackle the argument that I present when talking about the Houthis for for example, right? Like people will be like, okay, well, you're supporting. That's it. That's that's a that's just a way to stop the argument. I don't like when people talk about when when people defend Israel, I don't just say you're supporting. I also end up explaining to you why what Israel is doing is but for many people, they just kind [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=130.24s)]
*  of rely on pre existing biases that people have to make to not really make an argument but to hopefully stoke enough fear around the commentary that I'm engaging in. My position is very clear, especially when it comes to foreign policy, but just in general, I try to present a counter narrative and alternative narrative that you normally cannot get. Okay, you normally will not be getting this kind of narrative this perspective [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=160.24s)]
*  from any other mainstream outlet, you know, nice try terror supporter exactly just like that. So this is precisely the reason why what hiding the chat hiding what chat people are fantasizing about whatever is going on. In the like they think that they know what's happening. Yeah. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=190.24s)]
*  Honestly, all the Houthis did not kidnap those sailors that were legally detained for violating a legal embargo against Israel don't concede the framing of kidnap. I mean, even in that situation, like I think that those guys should have been released, like I don't even disagree with that. But I think that perspective is is marginal. It's like, like you're you're hyper focusing on any kind of wrongdoing that you can find in that process in the methods of the of these guys like they've also accidentally, they've they fired rockets on vessels. And I mean, there there has been a lot of [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=210.04s)]
*  There has been one like actual human casualty in the process. I think that that's also unacceptable. This is like an unfortunate byproduct of implementing a blockade. America, of course, has been incredibly incredibly violent when implementing other blockades like the one on Cuba, but it doesn't matter. Like I, I understand that. But in the grand scheme of things, I recognize that what they are doing is still on the morally correct side of the argument. And, and [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=240.04s)]
*  people don't want to entertain that even if they seemingly agree, right? There are a lot of Americans out there who have found themselves in this unique position, where on the closer post don't want that weird shit to pop up. We talk about [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=270.04s)]
*  could you get Ryan Coogler on the stream? I would love to like people, people there's a lot of people online who have not really thoroughly examine their positions, their own personal positions, their own personal convictions on this stuff. And have basically they have basically designed a world also thank me for rating with a [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=287.16s)]
*  central committee. Thank you for the raid. Hope you had a good stream. Do you see what I'm saying? Like people, a lot of people have designed the world in a way or feel as though they have this worldview, where they on the one side, say Israel's doing it okay, or Israel's bad Israel's the big bad. I can't believe Israel is doing such horrible things. But also everyone resisting against Israel is a that should be violently killed and stopped. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=307.36s)]
*  Right? Like that doesn't make any sense. Like that literally doesn't make sense. You're like, okay, they're doing it. But you don't want anyone to resist against it. And you will spend a good deal of time criticizing the ways in which like the Houthis have have tried to incur penalties that try to create penalties on Israel for doing is the worst crime of humanity. So it just doesn't make any sense. It means that they don't believe the first thing exactly. I do think that some people do actually some people do actually believe the first thing. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=337.36s)]
*  And don't believe the second thing. They don't understand it. They don't understand like that. That is the unfortunate byproduct of liberalism. It is the unfortunate byproduct of liberalism, which is that the unfortunate byproduct you posted a single frame from the meme video that shows nothing. Wait, really? Oh, I thought it actually saved it. Oops. Oh, I thought it was the video the poop sock video. The unfortunate byproduct of liberalism is Yeah, this is the actual this is what I was trying to download it up. I was gonna I should just use the crack one. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=367.36s)]
*  I will do this. Oh, also, I watched some of this video, the selective outreach video. It was very good. For the record. Very, very good. People don't care about the shit load of Anne Franks who have been murdered and forgotten about in Gaza because they don't give a fuck. Brown people. Yeah, they just don't they don't care. I mean, Nazi Germany didn't care about the Anne Franks either clearly, like the average German also didn't care even if they understood that it was happening in their own villages, you know, in like, they lived right next to a [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=397.36s)]
*  concentration camp and did not give a shit. Clearly. I'm really worried because they're going to use this to double down further on their cities unrelated to this. But I think that one part of the debate where he accidentally went you and started gaslighting into thinking he said they your [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=427.36s)]
*  response regarding that was so mature, like it's very clear you actually care about the issue of Palestine Israel and it's not just petty bullshit like Ethan. Yes. And I was also still willing to give him charitability even in that regard, even in that moment. But yeah, you want me to get Miko [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=439.0s)]
*  Pallad on the stream? Isn't that the former? He's like the former generals? I mean, he's the Israeli guy who's like anti Zionists, right? What is it? He's the story of the Holy Land Foundation five. Father Ma Tityahu Pallad who fought the [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=453.28s)]
*  1948 Arab Israeli war and serves as general in six day war became an advocate for Israeli dialogue with the Palestinian Liberation Organization after the Israeli cabinet. Miko Pallad followed his father's footsteps at first joining the Israel Special Force after high school earning the red [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=469.94s)]
*  beret but he soon grew to regret that decision. He surrendered his status as soon as he earned it becoming a medic but finally disgusted by the 82 Lebanon war buried his service pin in the dirt. One evening Pallad skipped the peace now demonstration in Jerusalem to attend a karate class and on that evening a grenade attack by right [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=480.26s)]
*  wing streamers killed one of the demonstrators. Emil Grunzweg Pallad took this as a sign according to one interview and consequently followed the path of karate a practice of non violence. That's such a funny way to that is such a funny way to adopt a political worldview. I'm not going to lie. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=493.94s)]
*  Either really thought you participate in the debate just to let him yell at you over your behavior. Yeah, I know. The daily wires things are not going well. Jose did a downfall the daily wire. I'm here for it. We'll take a look at that. Anyway, let's let's get started as a German in Gaza. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=512.1s)]
*  Gaza and also the US turned to the most eye opening case study I've ever witnessed. Yeah, I think one of the most insane parts about that is that it also kind of makes sense as to how a lot of the average German like in in German society that wasn't oblivious to these because they lived around concentration camps like Germans that moved into, you know, Poland or, or all these other like occupied territories like how they could turn a blind eye to these and how they could turn on their own fellow neighbors as a matter of fact. So I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=528.66s)]
*  fact. You get to see that in real time, because we are quite literally experiencing a live streamed, we're quite literally experiencing a live stream cost right now. And it's being done with American munitions being done with American tax dollars. And people can see it every day, people can communicate with the victims of it that are experiencing this genocide. I mean, I've directly interviewed someone who escaped Gaza like he was sitting right next to me, you know what I mean? I've directly interviewed someone who escaped Gaza like he was sitting right next to me, you know what I mean? I've [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=558.66s)]
*  particularly edited this because of all the SaudiDrца, that motherf***ers are out there. And there's probably the worst kind of people who think in [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=588.66s)]
* Zaiza. And, and even then, there are a there are a lot of people who turn a blind eye to these atrocities or try to package it in a way that makes sense in their own minds. This is what I mean, when I say like, there is an extent to liberalism where they think that they [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=599.8199999999999s)]
*  in Gaza at this point. So you know, we, I don't know. We should be trying to do everything in our [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=611.72s)]
*  power to, we should be trying to do everything in our power to stop, put a stop to all of this [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=620.28s)]
*  violence. YouTube calls up Hakim and others in Soviet atrocity denial and historical misinformation. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=625.88s)]
*  I don't care, dude. What the fuck? Okay. All right. Let's get to it. Yemezu, these had Tel Aviv [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=631.32s)]
*  airport with hypersonic missile Israel vows response. I was on your side. Most of the debate, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=637.48s)]
*  only thing I felt like you were misrepresenting why he was talking about why people fled to Israel. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=641.8000000000001s)]
*  He was just saying it wasn't because of Zionism, not that Palestine wasn't responsible for all [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=645.08s)]
*  Arab countries. I don't know who's right, but there was miscommunication there. Yes. I think [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=650.12s)]
*  we talked over one another on that front. I also admitted that, but it's a, it's a, it's a concept [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=653.96s)]
*  that is akin to the double genocide theory that came after world war two, where a lot of [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=660.04s)]
*  historians consider Holocaust revisionism as a matter of fact, to imply that the USSR has also [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=666.3599999999999s)]
*  done even more crimes against humanity than even Nazi Germany did. And that is a way to actually [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=672.5999999999999s)]
*  whitewash the, the crimes of Nazi Germany. It's called the double genocide theory, right? This [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=678.04s)]
*  is a version of genocide revisionism, historical revisionism surrounding the atrocities of the [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=684.8399999999999s)]
*  Holocaust. And this is the Israeli version of that, which is the double Nakba basically, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=690.76s)]
*  where the claim is that a direct, like a direct planned exterminationist policy that was carried [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=698.04s)]
*  out that successfully, that successfully ethnically cleansed indigenous population, 750,000 [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=707.88s)]
*  of them from their ancestral homelands is the same as other countries, different nations and their [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=716.4399999999999s)]
*  own reaction to said exterminationist campaigns during the pan-Arabic nationalist movements [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=724.52s)]
*  that happen to exist as nation states were being designed as these Arab countries that we now know, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=733.3199999999999s)]
*  these nations that we look at in the MENA region, they have not been around for that long either, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=740.6s)]
*  they have existed in one way, shape or form in the past, but they were usually under the banner of [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=745.64s)]
*  some kind of imperial power, whether it's the Ottoman Empire or whether it is the French or [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=750.6s)]
*  the British Empire colonial, these are, these were areas that the British and the French controlled, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=756.12s)]
*  right? And half of those places that Ethan was using as a comparison were not even under the [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=763.3199999999999s)]
*  rulership, they didn't have full sovereignty in Arab hands to begin with. All the way for the [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=770.92s)]
*  entire MENA region and the Levant, a lot of these places did not even have like complete sovereignty [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=778.1999999999999s)]
*  at this point. So you could attribute a lot of the violence and the lack of response from the [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=783.7199999999999s)]
*  administrators to said violence directly back to Western colonial powers, as a matter of fact, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=789.24s)]
*  you're saying that the centralized acts of violence coming from completely separate countries [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=795.0s)]
*  was what forced many Jews living in Arab countries, many Arab Jews that were a part of [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=804.36s)]
*  the fabric of these nation states that had these unique cultural heritage of living in these nation [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=813.96s)]
*  states under the Ottoman Empire that had the same language, had the same food, all of that, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=823.56s)]
*  all of a sudden is directly the fault of the Arabs being anti-Semitic across the board. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=833.8s)]
*  What are you talking about? He didn't let you speak? How else were you supposed to get your [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=841.0799999999999s)]
*  point across? You didn't speak over him and kept interrupting you because he had solid points? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=843.3199999999999s)]
*  I know, but I'm saying there was miscommunication in the back and forth that Ethan and I [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=846.28s)]
*  had on that point and that I recognize that because I feel like we talked over one another [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=853.4s)]
*  because I don't deny that there was anti-Semitic acts that took place in Morocco, Iraq, Egypt, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=859.9599999999999s)]
*  many of these places where there were Jewish people that lived. The reason why Jewish people [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=869.0s)]
*  lived in many of those places, ironically enough, was also because initially either they had moved [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=874.1999999999999s)]
*  away over the thousand year period. Libya is another one. Over the thousands of thousands [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=881.48s)]
*  of years they migrated from where Judea and Samaria is. But also a big part of the reason [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=887.56s)]
*  why there was a lot of Jewish people in these regions was because they saw the Ottoman Empire [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=893.9599999999999s)]
*  as a safe haven for Jews as opposed to Western Europe, as opposed to Europe in general, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=898.4399999999999s)]
*  where there was a shit ton of pogroms happening. But this was before World War II. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=903.0s)]
*  And that's the reason why many Jews had escaped, many Jews had fled the Inquisition, for example, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=906.76s)]
*  and came to these Arab countries. And they lived in comparison to their existence in Europe, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=911.3199999999999s)]
*  or in comparison to their existence in Russia, for example, with Ashkenazi Jews, like they had [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=920.4399999999999s)]
*  a much better life in these Arab countries under the banner of the Ottoman Empire as well. So [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=925.0799999999999s)]
*  so all of that, of course, changed in the aftermath of the Nakba, while simultaneously [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=930.04s)]
*  the sovereignty initiatives were happening in all of these Arab nations, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=936.4399999999999s)]
*  different Arab nations, like they are all unique. They all have their own, they all had their own [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=942.04s)]
*  different struggles, right, to become nation states, to claim that this was all because of [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=948.8399999999999s)]
*  like, Arab anti-Semitism, which forced Arab Jews to become Zionists is bullshit. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=959.0s)]
*  Ethan, I think one of the worst things that he did was basically undermine Avishlaim's main thesis [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=969.08s)]
*  in terms of his own personal experience in Iraq as an Iraqi Jew, and then his own personal [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=976.04s)]
*  experience, his family's experience going to Israel, because there's also the second side [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=981.64s)]
*  of the story as well of like, the racism that they experienced, the racism that Arab Jews [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=985.88s)]
*  experienced in Israel, when they first came to Israel was also horrifying. So it's like, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=992.6s)]
*  it's his main thesis that he misrepresented by focusing on the first part saying that Jews, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1000.6s)]
*  of course, suffered violence in the hands of like, pogroms or Arab resistance, right? Of course, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1009.72s)]
*  they did. This is not something that I discount at all. Claiming that he didn't respect the Jews [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1017.72s)]
*  that rose up in arms against the Nazis because they aren't pacifists is also up there in terms [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1022.6800000000001s)]
*  of disgusting statement. Yeah. We were Iraqi Jews. We were Arab Jews. And there was a long [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1025.96s)]
*  tradition of religious tolerance and coexistence between the different minorities. So we, for us- [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1034.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's why I mentioned the entirety of Europe. Like, you don't say that all of the, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1042.76s)]
*  you don't say that it was like European racism across the board that was responsible for the [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1047.16s)]
*  fucking Holocaust, right? You know that it was Nazi Germany. Muslim Jewish coexistence was not [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1053.08s)]
*  an abstract idea. It was the everyday reality. Iraq didn't have a Jewish problem. Europe had [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1062.44s)]
*  a Jewish problem. In Europe, the Jews were the other. They stood out. And anti-Semitism is a [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1071.8s)]
*  European malady. It was born in Europe in the Middle Ages. The church had a lot to do with it. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1081.96s)]
*  There was no tradition of anti-Semitism in the Arab world. It was- [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1089.4s)]
*  By the way, when I say this, people say I'm a freaking Ottoman supremacist, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1096.04s)]
*  neo-Ottoman, Ottoman supremacist, all this shit. Like, this is just a historical fact. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1102.76s)]
*  Exported from Europe to the Middle East. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1110.1200000000001s)]
*  You know, what was I talking about? Oh yeah, we got the daily wise decline. You could say that [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1116.1200000000001s)]
*  the white supremacist ideology practicing in Germany was the same as the rest of Europe, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1120.44s)]
*  just more severe. Yes. But it's important to also mention that severity because, like, there have [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1123.0s)]
*  been throughout times, throughout centuries, there have been pogroms directed by basically every [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1129.48s)]
*  single European country. Okay. But the reason why you don't say this is like, like, you don't, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1137.24s)]
*  you don't make it seem as though this was what actually contributed. Ironically enough, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1143.24s)]
*  Israel doesn't even say, like, Europe is the reason why Israel exists in a negative fashion. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1147.48s)]
*  They say it's like Arab racism and Arab anti-Semitism against Jews that is responsible [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1152.76s)]
*  for Israel. That's ridiculous. You could say that about, like, Nazi Germany more than you could say [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1157.4s)]
*  that about the Arabs. But of course, you have to say that about the Arabs. And the reason why you [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1162.2s)]
*  have to say that about the Arabs is because you have to justify what you are doing to Palestinians. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1166.76s)]
*  You have to justify what you're doing to other Arab nations as well. And that's precisely the [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1172.28s)]
*  reason why the experience of, of revenge, the, the narrative of revenge still almost always [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1176.04s)]
*  goes back to the Arab countries. There's a lot of anti-Arab racism in the process that, I mean, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1184.6s)]
*  you have to, you have to lean into that. You have to believe personally in order to at least justify [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1190.44s)]
*  the, the atrocities that take place. All right. People keep forgetting that the U S is also [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1198.04s)]
*  turned Jewish refugees away. Yeah. All right. So the hoodie is from entire studios, man. I'm [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1202.2s)]
*  fucking holy shit. And it's, it's purposely box cut. It's short. Okay. And it has a zipper that [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1207.64s)]
*  goes all the way up to your eye line. All right. God damn. Everybody always asks me. I don't even [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1213.3200000000002s)]
*  know if you'll be able to purchase it now because of the tariffs. God damn. Shortest from the [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1218.28s)]
*  Palestinian youth movement. The Merkava tank with the child on top of it, throwing up the peace sign. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1222.68s)]
*  What was I going to say? Oh yeah. I'm working on, I'm working on having Avi Schlem on the broadcast [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1228.68s)]
*  as well, specifically to address some of that misinformation. I think it's important to do that, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1234.92s)]
*  but, um, aside from that, let's do it. Let's start. So Yemen's Houthis hit the Tel Aviv airport with [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1239.72s)]
*  hypersonic missiles. Israel vows response. Can you please get Ethan in his audience to listen into [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1246.68s)]
*  that? Um, I don't think I can do that. I have no power over them. Whoa. An unprecedented scene in [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1252.92s)]
*  central. Why'd you say, Oh, Israel have done this already. They've just never struck. They've never [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1262.1200000000001s)]
*  successfully struck like, um, the airport before, but they've actually penetrated, uh, the, the [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1266.92s)]
*  Houthis have successfully penetrated the iron dome in the past with loiter munitions and hypersonic [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1273.08s)]
*  missiles as well. This is not, this is not new. This is, you know, this is something that they've [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1277.08s)]
*  been able to do. I don't even know how, I don't even know how they've been able to do it. It's [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1282.28s)]
*  fucking insane to me. They are the poorest nation on the planet. Yeah. Of course they get like [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1285.8s)]
*  support from, uh, regional actors. Of course, of course, but having said that it's still, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1290.12s)]
*  it's still incredible that they have any capacity to even survive, let alone resist [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1296.84s)]
*  one of the most powerful countries in the region. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1301.8s)]
*  By the Houthis in Yemen hits Ben Gurion airport. Oh, more military confirmed. It failed to intercept [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1305.32s)]
*  the missile and is looking into how and why it was able to bypass the country's multi-layered [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1312.6000000000001s)]
*  air defense systems. The Houthi watching as mingled Pearl coach about this is so funny. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1319.56s)]
*  Is that what you said? Well, let me tell you something. It's expected. This is the, this is [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1324.92s)]
*  the opportunity. This is the opportunity for everyone who is pro-Israel to turn around and [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1331.0s)]
*  be like, can you imagine what missiles dropping looks like? Can you imagine? And it's like, dude, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1334.6s)]
*  what are you saying? That's the past 16 months for people living in Gaza that every single day, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1340.6s)]
*  for people living in Gaza that don't have a fucking iron dome or a multi-nation coalition [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1347.4s)]
*  specifically designed to intercept all missiles coming in the direction of Israel, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1354.76s)]
*  which has the most powerful nation on the planet, the United States of America leading [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1361.0s)]
*  said multinational coalition, okay. Protecting the seas. Israel has dropped bombs and reduced [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1365.0s)]
*  their neighborhoods in Southern Lebanon. Israel is bombing Syria right now. What are we talking [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1372.28s)]
*  about? Israel bombed the airport in Yemen. Israel bombed the fucking airport in Yemen [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1379.96s)]
*  while the world health organizations leader was inside of the airport. The idea that this is not [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1388.92s)]
*  tit for tat, the idea that this is like so impossible to contend with is ridiculous. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1397.96s)]
*  The only way that you see this as a major atrocity as opposed to the relentless bombing [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1406.36s)]
*  that the Yemeni population has endured for two administrations, well, four technically, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1413.3999999999999s)]
*  but especially in the last two, it means that you just don't see them as human beings and you only [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1420.04s)]
*  think of Israelis as human beings. That's it. Israel has shown every single country in the region [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1425.8799999999999s)]
*  that the only thing that they respond to is force. Okay. I've repeated this statement time [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1432.92s)]
*  and time again throughout many initiatives that Israel has taken where they claim to be fighting [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1439.16s)]
*  a seven front war, where they claim to open new fronts in the war over and over again, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1443.88s)]
*  while they're simultaneously doing a genocide. It's so crazy. Yeah, it didn't even disrupt the [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1449.96s)]
*  operations in the airport, but it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. What matters is it actually, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1454.68s)]
*  when you have a missile all the way that goes all the way from Yemen to Israel, to the Tel Aviv [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1459.96s)]
*  airport, that actually it's not about killing someone. I'm glad that no one got killed in the [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1465.72s)]
*  process. What are you talking about? It's actually about killing the confidence that Israel has, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1472.68s)]
*  that they can get away with doing whatever the fuck they want. It's not even these guys are not [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1478.76s)]
*  in the business. Like here, a great example I will use is what Hezbollah did, right? Where Hezbollah, [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1483.48s)]
*  Aldani Marquis in the chat. If you're interested, salam alaikum, brother, just tuning in. If you're [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1492.6s)]
*  interested in the details of how the Houthis are able to do what they're doing from a technical [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1496.52s)]
*  perspective, I can recommend Tom Cooper's Hot Skies Over Yemen Volume 2 short read, very detailed. I [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1499.16s)]
*  think you'd like it. Okay. I don't know if we can get into that right now, but what I was saying is [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1504.6s)]
*  what I was saying is, fuck, I lost my train of thought. What I was saying was, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1509.72s)]
*  there is this security blanket that Israel relies on to say, you can, it's a social contract, right? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1516.52s)]
*  You can live in Israel proper, and we will do everything in our power as a mighty nation [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1527.64s)]
*  to make sure that you have your regular life. You can go, you can eat Israeli hummus, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1534.36s)]
*  Sabra hummus, you can go listen to psy-trans music all day every day, you can get your marketing job, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1541.56s)]
*  you can get a degree in a university, and you can live the experience of a normal Western nation. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1547.24s)]
*  But Israel also simultaneously is doing a fucking genocide, right? And the Iron Dome and the [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1555.08s)]
*  defense, the defense mechanism that exists in the region to protect the day-to-day experiences of [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1563.48s)]
*  regular Israeli civilians, regular Israeli citizens, that has caused Israel to be able to [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1571.08s)]
*  behave in this incredibly violent manner and shelter its population from any sort of retaliation, [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1577.56s)]
*  okay? Any sort of retaliation whatsoever. And Israel, because of that, has been able to [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1585.48s)]
*  radicalize its own countrymen and engage in these horrifying acts, these crimes against humanity, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1592.8400000000001s)]
*  and it still doesn't matter. There's no repercussions for it whatsoever, but once that [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1602.68s)]
*  security barrier, the collective consciousness surrounding Israeli security goes away, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1607.8000000000002s)]
*  once that veil is pierced, all of a sudden people start making different decisions. This is [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1616.6s)]
*  one other form of, this is yet another form of pressure, right? Like this is why BDS was [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1622.76s)]
*  incredibly important in the abolition of the apartheid in South Africa. The abolition of [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1628.84s)]
*  the apartheid in South Africa was important because it made it so that South Africans [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1633.4799999999998s)]
*  were a pariah. White South Africans were treated as a pariah everywhere they went, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1641.32s)]
*  and that created a lot of resentment internally where they were like, this is unsustainable. This [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1645.6399999999999s)]
*  structure that we exist under is completely unsustainable. It's untenable because countries [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1649.96s)]
*  are refusing to support us, and if we want to be a normal country, we can't have this apartheid [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1655.3999999999999s)]
*  structure anymore. This is part of the reason why I've stated that the Houthis' actions in terms of [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1661.56s)]
*  like the Houthis' actions in terms of resisting against Israel while imperfect still ultimately [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1668.28s)]
*  create pressure points against Israel. BDS, which is a peaceful mode of resistance, [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1675.8s)]
*  which the American government is actively trying to make illegal at the federal level tomorrow [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1683.8799999999999s)]
*  with an insane bill that they want to push, which we're going to be talking about in a little bit, [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1689.0s)]
*  where they've already at the state level made it illegal to engage in civil disobedience or any [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1693.64s)]
*  sort of like peaceful initiative to implement boycotts, implement divestments, or implement [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1699.72s)]
*  sanctions on the state of Israel, demand sanctions on the state of Israel. The entire purpose of this [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1705.5600000000002s)]
*  project is to make sure that you just simply cannot do anything against Israel whatsoever. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1711.88s)]
*  There's just not a thing that you are allowed to do. It is always going to be a multifaceted approach [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1718.28s)]
*  to try and stop America's ally, to America's greatest ally, its favorite client, a client state [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1725.08s)]
*  from, you know, doing unlimited death and destruction without any sort of, [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1734.12s)]
*  without any sort of repercussions whatsoever. It's always going to be difficult, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1741.16s)]
*  but I'm not going to sit around and constantly rail against those in the region that try to do [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=1745.0s)]

*  This spokesman for Houthi rebels who control much of Yemen said the attack was in support of the [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=2804.6000000000004s)]

*  Chatters. You're so dumb. Don't be stupid. Expanding military operation involving the [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=2844.2000000000003s)]
*  mobilization of thousands of reservists. The army says that dozens of Hamas fighters have been [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=2849.88s)]

*  But protesters in Tel Aviv accused their prime minister of being more focused on military victory [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=2872.84s)]

*  and the longer this war lasts, more of them could be killed. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=2887.0s)]
*  The main issue is that the military operation is growing stronger and stronger and then talking [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=2891.64s)]
*  about bringing more troops and reserves and we're really afraid that it's going to kill most of the [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=2896.84s)]
*  hostages. But what of Gaza's people themselves? Inside their family tent, Ahmed's parents take [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=2902.6s)]
*  off his top to show the effect of Israel's aid blockade on the body of a seven-year-old child. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=2910.36s)]

*  Brother, are you crazy? This is actually incredible. The very fact that they briefly [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=2996.2s)]

*  package it with Israel's fucking depraved humanitarian aid blockade, which is a war crime, [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3013.8s)]
*  by the way, means that the tide has shifted dramatically under normal circumstances. I mean, [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3020.2000000000003s)]
*  this is channel four and they have been probably one of the most pro-Palestine mainstream media [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3026.84s)]
*  outlets across the board, right? As far as like legacy publishers and mainstream media goes, [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3032.44s)]
*  channel four has been definitely at the forefront. Not to say that they're perfect, [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3036.84s)]
*  they're far from perfect, okay? But consistently they have spoken out, [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3041.32s)]
*  they've consistently spoken out against Israel or have like shown what is an accurate reflection [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3049.2400000000002s)]
*  of what's happening on the day-to-day existence in Gaza. Having said that, the very fact that [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3056.28s)]
*  they are packaging the overwhelming majority, the overwhelming majority of this commentary [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3061.8s)]
*  around Israel's starvation campaign means that the tide has shifted under normal circumstances. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3068.2s)]
*  It would be the exact opposite. They would talk for one minute about the starvation and then [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3076.12s)]
*  package it as like the greatest crime against humanity, against the poor Israelis that are so [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3082.7599999999998s)]
*  scared to live inside of bomb shelters now or whatever. That's how they used to package it. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3089.08s)]
*  That's how most mainstream media was packaging these stories. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3094.68s)]
*  The Palestinian bourgeoisie cashing in on the catastrophe is a crazy thing to say. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3154.68s)]
*  There is no more functionally, there is no more Palestinian bourgeoisie at this point. It's a [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3181.48s)]
*  genocide. Okay. That's ridiculous. In Gaza, there is no, there is no like capital owning class. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3185.7200000000003s)]
*  Most of the food that they have, they don't even have like normal. I've been, there's a tick. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3192.52s)]
*  I don't want to give a lot of attention to Palestinian creators on TikTok and whatnot, [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3198.6s)]

*  But there is a, there is a 16 year old that, that is a tick tocker in Gaza that shows the conditions [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3208.6s)]
*  in the markets that I have reposted a bunch of times. Like there's nothing, there's no more food. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3219.0s)]
*  The only food that's like readily available is at food depots and like aid sites. And even then [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3224.2s)]
*  there's very little food left at this point. And that is because for the past two months at this, [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3230.04s)]
*  for the past two months, Israel has stopped all humanitarian aid from going into Gaza. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3235.8s)]
*  Side world on the Israeli government to move their position. What would you like to see now? [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3240.2000000000003s)]
*  What we would like to see is to not urbanize the food according to the international humanitarian [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3245.7200000000003s)]
*  law. It's not even allowed to use the food and the humanitarian supplies as a weapon, as a means for [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3252.76s)]
*  for make this pressure to Hamas or others. They need to have a pressure and more pressure in the [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3261.88s)]
*  Israeli authorities. Yeah, this is what the, this is what I was talking about. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3267.72s)]
*  They actually run out of food. I'm going to go to the markets right now. Look at this trouble next to me. That's crazy. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3271.48s)]
*  So I was pretty hungry. So I went to the market and I was really shocked. This guy who usually [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3275.8s)]

*  Hollywood. It's a, it's a term for Hollywood. They say that Palestinians do palliwood as they fake the [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3346.3599999999997s)]
*  atrocities that they're experiencing. It's not a real thing. It's a, it's a horrible, in real time, [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3352.3599999999997s)]
*  Holocaust revisionist perspective. Yeah. That's what that means. When you hear someone, [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3359.72s)]
*  when you hear like an account saying like palliwood again or whatever here, yeah, here, [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3364.68s)]
*  let's look at the Wikipedia. Paliwood, a portmanteau of Palestine and Hollywood [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3370.2s)]
*  is a disinformation campaign used to falsely accuse Palestinians for faking suffering and [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3374.4399999999996s)]
*  civilian deaths during their conflict in Israel. The term came in the currency found the killing of [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3377.64s)]
*  Muhammad al-Durah in the 2000, in 2000 during the second intifada involving a challenge to the [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3381.64s)]
*  veracity of the photographic evidence. Israeli pundits have used the term to dismiss video [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3387.64s)]
*  showing Israeli violence or denial of Palestinian suffering during the Gaza war. It has been used [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3390.7599999999998s)]

*  been described by some authors as a conspiracy theory. The term has been used as a propaganda [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3397.8s)]
*  and disinformation tool by the Israeli government officials. Some of the most insane things they'll [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3401.0800000000004s)]
*  do is like they'll have like a music video shot in Lebanon and they'll post the music video being [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3404.6800000000003s)]
*  shot to imply that they're shooting it in Gaza to lie about the Israeli atrocities or something [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3409.5600000000004s)]
*  like that. It's insane. It is the same as Holocaust denialism. It's just, it's happening in real time. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3414.28s)]
*  Yeah. Al-Durah is the, is the famous photo of the child, right? Child hiding behind his dad [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3420.6000000000004s)]

*  telegenically dead children, like implying that Palestinians purposefully kill themselves in [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3434.04s)]
*  front of Israeli missiles, in front of Israeli gunfire to make the world hate Israel. Of course, [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3442.44s)]
*  the quickest solution to that is to not shoot the Palestinian civilians. Yeah. Another, [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3450.2799999999997s)]
*  Paliwood is also what Sex Pestiny, Bonarelli has also implied saying that Palestinians were [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3456.12s)]
*  farming TikTok clips when they were being killed while waving white flags by the Israeli military. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3464.6s)]
*  That's what Destiny said about the person that was shot after being interviewed. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3472.84s)]
*  Open the crossings and borders so we can get our supplies and the humanitarian supplies without [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3477.16s)]

*  issues into consideration, the militarisation and the urbanisation of the food. And can I ask you [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3488.76s)]
*  finally and very briefly, if you would, do you think the outside world should be ashamed of its [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3494.6s)]
*  approach to Gaza at the minute? I'm not sure how they are just passively scrolling, you know, [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3499.08s)]
*  this horrifying images and videos that the suffering of the Gazans without the answer is [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3505.96s)]
*  yes. To all these things. This is make a lot of people are losing faith of the international [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3512.36s)]
*  community and the international community principles and laws. So this is why we are [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3520.6s)]
*  insisting there is still a window for interventions and urgent intervention and action in that [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZscNTDslE&t=3525.96s)]
