**HasanAbi:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY)
*  in his actions and maybe you know a little a little bit brainbroken [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=0.0s)]
*  Okay, but like the the I'm not I'm not like it's right there [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=5.0s)]
*  It's right there. Am I crazy? Like what are we doing? Just watch the clip is the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=11.4s)]
*  Assumption now is the assumption nowadays that [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=18.36s)]
*  I [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=21.98s)]
*  Literally though you have to be careful who you verbally align with even if it's his joke like obviously people will tie you to anything [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=27.3s)]
*  And radicals will find ways to link. I [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=32.78s)]
*  I [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=35.82s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=37.980000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, dude, what are you gonna do? What do you listen if it happens it happens if the government wants to fucking arrest me? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=40.260000000000005s)]
*  They're gonna arrest me big dog [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=47.620000000000005s)]
*  Okay, I know I know I've been doing this for a while I've been doing this for quite a while chatter [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=50.14s)]
*  Okay [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=58.66s)]
*  We got low-key talking about kneecap who's coming after kneecap [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=61.459999999999994s)]
*  Well, I was talking about that as well. I've been talking to them as well. What is this? It's not hate [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=66.94s)]
*  Just a statement mod. I don't hate anyone nor I'm sinister and sad [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=71.47999999999999s)]
*  But I will call out shit and will not be sorry about it. Literally though. What are you? What is this? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=74.6s)]
*  What does this take? What is as much on as hardest to link you is actually crazy, bro. Shut up. It's fine [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=78.5s)]
*  There needs to be some repercussions repercussions for people who lie patently about you they're getting too comfortable [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=88.26s)]
*  I don't think you guys understand I'm a fucking public figure [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=92.98s)]
*  Okay, there is not a lot of penalties for lying about a public figure. You are oblivious to how [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=96.82s)]
*  Defamation works, okay [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=104.12s)]
*  You are oblivious to how defamation works in the United States of America, especially [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=106.16000000000001s)]
*  like if if the ADL said that about me as a [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=111.44s)]
*  Institution like a legally recognized institution in the UK and I was in the UK as well as a British citizen [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=117.72s)]
*  I would literally sue them [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=123.4s)]
*  Successfully and instantly that's it [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=126.0s)]
*  If you talked about the liberal [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=129.18s)]
*  Defenders tactic of same both sides suffer how to make them understand that they were defending literally and I mean is there a both sides on the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=130.18s)]
*  Hall house today [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=137.1s)]
*  Do they talk about how both sides over into the hall house if no then they should be able to understand how there are no [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=138.1s)]
*  both sides on [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=143.52s)]
*  on this [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=145.02s)]
*  This new iteration of the house as well [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=146.38s)]
*  It's basically inevitable at this point or Trump or JD will directly mention us on at this point [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=148.82s)]
*  Chad just need to chill and see what happens next but that will be an interesting day indeed. Yeah [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=152.78s)]
*  I don't know why all of my [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=158.22s)]
*  30,000 producers in the chat are just like losing their minds about what I should be doing. It's like I know [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=160.62s)]
*  I'm I'm not oblivious to everything that's going on. Trust me [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=166.94s)]
*  Anyway, can we revisit timing people out for being annoying? Yes, where are those pants from their car heart? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=176.38s)]
*  Oh [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=183.82s)]
*  Seems like where she really has become a bull to the live. I you know, that's not the case [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=184.82s)]
*  the only person that you're seeing in like mainstream outlets that try to rally around this cause of [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=190.18s)]
*  trying to deplatform me is the likes of Richie Torres or [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=195.73999999999998s)]
*  ADL's very own Jonathan Greenblatt. The problem however, is that ADL's very own Jonathan Greenblatt has lost his [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=200.7s)]
*  has lost his [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=208.7s)]
*  institutional prominence [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=210.22s)]
*  partially because he gave the game away about how much [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=211.94s)]
*  He gave the game about how much he he actually cares only almost singularly focused on defending Israel [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=217.18s)]
*  So when that happens like most normal people like they'll give you a little bit of daylight though. They'll allow you to speak [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=224.26s)]
*  They'll allow you to talk about stuff on on [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=232.94s)]
*  You know mainstream outlets and whatnot, but ultimately it doesn't go anywhere [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=236.26s)]
*  I think one of the worst things he did I [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=240.5s)]
*  think one of the worst things Jonathan Greenblatt did for his own cause if his if his goal is to like [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=243.78s)]
*  Maintain his position as like someone who cares about [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=250.38s)]
*  antisemitism [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=255.34s)]
*  So that he can you know make a more convincing argument that like all of Israel's enemies are antisemites themselves [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=256.66s)]
*  He probably should not have been [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=264.02s)]
*  so [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=267.06s)]
*  Worried about Elon Musk coming after him [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=268.58s)]
*  But he very clearly he he very clearly is a [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=273.26s)]
*  You know agent of the regime, right? He's an agent of [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=279.02s)]
*  Conservatism once he once he just like like there were a bunch of different moments where people were like what the fuck are you doing? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=283.97999999999996s)]
*  Why are you defending Elon Musk? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=290.29999999999995s)]
*  Like what's wrong with you because they did that he he did that the first time when Elon Musk was like I got fix my [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=291.41999999999996s)]
*  hair is f**king awful [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=297.82s)]
*  The very first time Elon Musk was like yeah Jews are doing the great replacement by importing the third world into this country [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=299.94s)]
*  Like and he defended Elon after that that was a big deal for obviously a lot of people who care about antisemitism [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=307.61999999999995s)]
*  They were like what the are you doing? You know? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=315.65999999999997s)]
*  Adl flag this guy for saying anti-zionism is an antisemitic dude stop stop. I know it's your link. Okay, stop [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=318.94s)]
*  Stop I'm not I'm I'm specifically not watching it now because you keep linking it over and over again [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=326.09999999999997s)]
*  Stop trying to sell promo in the chat. It's okay [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=332.46s)]
*  huh [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=336.46s)]
*  Combating antisemitism isn't as important to the ADL if it's not also anti-israel if it's just normal antisemitism [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=337.86s)]
*  It doesn't mention Israel is clearly not a priority. No, I'm I [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=343.62s)]
*  Taken it once that further I'm saying that the ADL in order to maintain some semblance of legitimacy [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=347.82s)]
*  Had to in the past [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=354.38s)]
*  Act like they cared about normal antisemitism like real antisemitism that exists [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=356.97999999999996s)]
*  But that only served the the actual purpose of the ADL which was to attack Israel's enemies [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=361.38s)]
*  But they have lost that institutional positioning because they they gave the game away post October 7 [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=367.26s)]
*  when they just like completely stopped the covering like actual antisemitism and [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=374.41999999999996s)]
*  Hyper focused on talking about how like, you know Jews who wear kofi as on college campuses are actually the biggest threat to [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=381.65999999999997s)]
*  America and also the biggest threat as far as like antisemitism goes so that [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=387.85999999999996s)]
*  Yeah for the average person like once you start doing that especially in America like Americans are not very intelligent people [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=393.9s)]
*  right like they're very [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=401.29999999999995s)]
*  black and white in their understanding of the world Americans don't have the nuance to think like a guy like Stephen Miller could potentially be a [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=402.65999999999997s)]
*  Straightforward neo-nazi because they're like, isn't he Jewish? I don't understand right so because of that [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=409.5s)]
*  Once like Jonathan Greenblatt comes after like anti-Sinus Jews, for example, most Americans will go. Oh [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=415.46000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think this is the case one of the greatest examples of the ADL not giving a shit about antisemitism [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=422.94000000000005s)]
*  is the fact that he they constantly run cover for Elon Musk because Elon Musk is pro-israel and [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=429.1s)]
*  Elon Musk is also probably one of the largest forces of growing [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=435.28000000000003s)]
*  Nazis like with what he did on Twitter. He has normalized neo-nazi discourse in a way that I [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=441.88000000000005s)]
*  Don't even know if we we are truly capable of understanding [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=449.40000000000003s)]
*  Like he has made he has opened the floodgates of this shit, right? He has opened the goddamn floodgates of [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=453.56s)]
*  Of Nazi sentiment and it's crazy [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=462.04s)]
*  What is this? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=465.26s)]
*  Eyal you Kobe breaking a songpiker hail by the New York Times the future progressive and tells audiences DC attack might have been a [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=466.04s)]
*  False flag that immediately says the guy was genuine with his actions is a glorification of terrorism. Wait, what I literally said [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=471.34000000000003s)]
*  It's not a false flag. Why did these guys lie about the most basic shit? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=477.44s)]
*  Let's see what they clipped because the funniest is when they actually don't clip it out of context, but just simply say [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=481.24s)]
*  Say something that I'm not saying in the clip, let's see [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=488.03999999999996s)]
*  but like the the [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=492.2s)]
*  I'm not I'm not mr [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=494.71999999999997s)]
*  false flag at all [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=496.2s)]
*  but like every single thing that he did in the aftermath of the shooting is so fucking crazy that it's like [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=497.0s)]
*  You could not have fucking designed a a [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=503.88s)]
*  Incident like this you could not have designed a better false flag incident like this [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=507.32s)]
*  I'm not saying it is a false flag incident at all. I'm not saying that I [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=511.96s)]
*  Think this is just a one dude who is genuine in his actions and and maybe you know a little a little bit brainbroken [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=515.8s)]
*  Okay, but like the the I'm not I'm not mr. False flag at all, but like every single [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=525.4s)]
*  Breaking a songpiker hail by the New York Times the future. Dude, you can't do that [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=533.4399999999999s)]
*  You can't do that [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=538.1999999999999s)]
*  You have to you have to clip it out of context dumbass [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=540.1999999999999s)]
*  You can't literally clip it in context. What the fuck are you doing? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=543.56s)]
*  People are so stupid nowadays, too [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=548.28s)]
*  This is a 36 second clip anyone can watch and tell you you told multiple lies about it [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=550.76s)]
*  I don't understand why these guys I mean, I guess it doesn't matter. Does no one watch the clip? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=556.0799999999999s)]
*  It's fucking 37 seconds long [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=561.52s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=565.28s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense like any [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=567.88s)]
*  Make any sense like every single thing he claims I said [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=571.28s)]
*  In this fucking clip is just the exact opposite. They have incredibly selective hearing no [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=576.64s)]
*  But it's not even selective hearing. It's like [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=583.28s)]
*  What use is there? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=587.32s)]
*  for language like this is [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=589.96s)]

*  They are abusing the fact that Twitter users do not watch the clip. It is just lying [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=775.32s)]

*  context [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=789.32s)]

*  They just straight up they just try to put the clip in context and we'll just claim that I'm saying the exact opposite thing [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=792.24s)]
*  That I'm saying anyway, this is 37 seconds long. I'm sure [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=798.64s)]
*  people aren't [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=803.64s)]

*  I mean, this isn't just this is for people who probably experience this and get annoyed by it [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=827.36s)]
*  You know what? I mean, it's 37 seconds long man [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=833.4000000000001s)]
*  It's not that difficult for someone to just like watch it and be like that's not what that clip is saying at all actually [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=836.8s)]
*  it's the exact opposite of what that clip is saying you have you looked at a [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=842.76s)]
*  37 second clip and chose [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=848.0799999999999s)]
*  with the with the knowledge that [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=851.16s)]
*  You are equipped that your audience is so dumb that they won't even watch a [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=853.68s)]
*  37 second clip you just chose to lie about everything that I'm saying in the clip [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=857.76s)]
*  You chose to claim the exact opposite of what I am saying, you know, it's ridiculous [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=863.96s)]
*  That's like two tick tocks worth of attention span you expect a lot out of these people [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=871.12s)]
*  No, I think we're we're dumber than dirt dude [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=875.4s)]
*  We are we have officially become so goddamn stupid [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=878.96s)]
*  Bringing up false at the time when even if a son doesn't believe the implants the idea into people's brains [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=883.12s)]
*  Bro, we're living in post-truth the fish rots from the head down. Why wouldn't they act like this? We're in an IRL cyberpunk dystopia [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=889.16s)]
*  I know I know lying is OP but like and I getting dumber and dumber but there is a level [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=894.4399999999999s)]
*  There is a level of lying that I think even the average like even the dumbest person will probably go [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=901.64s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think that's correct. This is one of those moments where it's not like what I'm saying is [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=908.9599999999999s)]
*  Confusing like I'm very clearly I'm very clearly saying this is not a false flag it [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=916.1600000000001s)]
*  I understand why people think it's a false flag because it looks so perfect for a false flag [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=922.0s)]
*  But I don't think this is a false flag and I keep repeating that I don't think it's a false flag throughout this [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=928.8000000000001s)]
*  37 second video. It's a very clear point. It's not nuanced dude, dude [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=935.6400000000001s)]
*  You say it nuances that this is not this is not nuanced [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=942.08s)]
*  This is just how language works once I didn't even get clipped out of context [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=946.8000000000001s)]
*  I can't even complain that this is a clip out of context because the context is still in the clip. I [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=952.2s)]
*  Mean sure there is a broader conversation that I'm having there that you're not gonna be able to understand in 30 seconds [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=959.2s)]
*  but this is one of those moments where like it basically is just [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=964.6800000000001s)]
*  It's it's captured the the essence of what I'm saying is captured in the clip look I'm gonna play one once again [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=968.1999999999999s)]
*  So I'm first I'm gonna read you what the clip [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=974.8399999999999s)]
*  Implied like what this dumb fuck is saying [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=978.8399999999999s)]
*  I'm saying in the clip a songpiker hailed by the New York Times of the future of progressivism tells his audience [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=981.26s)]
*  That the DC attack might have been a false flag then immediately says this guy was genuine with his actions [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=987.04s)]
*  This is a glorification of terrorism now. What doesn't make sense here [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=991.7199999999999s)]
*  Is that these two things are at odds with one another if he was genuine with his actions? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=996.5999999999999s)]
*  Then that would imply that I'm not saying it's a false flag [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1003.56s)]
*  Having said that let's take a look at what I actually said. This is obviously clipped by Dan Stalkman as well [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1007.3599999999999s)]
*  My my number one perverted Zionist stalker, let's take a look [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1015.76s)]
*  But like the the [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1021.2s)]
*  I'm not I'm not mr. False flag at all [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1023.64s)]
*  but like every single thing that he did in the aftermath of the shooting is so fucking crazy that it's like [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1026.32s)]
*  you could not have fucking designed a [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1033.04s)]
*  Incident like this you could not have designed a better false flag incident like this [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1036.48s)]
*  I'm not saying it is a false flag incident at all. I'm not saying that I think this is just a one dude who is [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1041.36s)]
*  Genuine in his actions and and maybe you know a little a little bit brainbroken [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1048.96s)]
*  Okay, but like the the I'm not I'm not like it's right there. It's right there [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1055.04s)]
*  Am I crazy? Like what are we doing? Just watch the fucking clip is the assumption now is the assumption [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1063.8s)]
*  nowadays that that [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1072.3600000000001s)]
*  My expectation is you can't even watch the clip like is that what it is [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1074.9199999999998s)]
*  Because this is basically the same as just someone claiming something that is a complete fabrication and then everyone going yeah [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1079.28s)]
*  I believe it [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1086.6999999999998s)]
*  If you can't even watch the fucking clip [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1091.24s)]
*  What's next you can't even read the entire tweet? [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1094.8799999999999s)]
*  Like how much more how much further can we go how much more can we devolve? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1098.9199999999998s)]
*  In our endless well of stupidity [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1104.36s)]
*  Where will this go I can't wait to see you know [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1108.56s)]
*  The expectation is that they posted a clip therefore the clip supports their claim so pedophile Nazis won't need to bother watching [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1113.7199999999998s)]
*  Watching the clip is anti-semitic [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1123.24s)]
*  This isn't even like I said, this isn't even about nuance like [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1125.7199999999998s)]
*  This is not about nuance what is shocking is is how bad this propaganda is [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1130.52s)]
*  They're gonna be like well you would well we would lie brazenly exactly like that. So why should we believe you? [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1147.52s)]
*  This is so dumb. It's like asking [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1153.6s)]
*  grok to fucking [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1157.24s)]
*  Summarize the the video, you know [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1159.3999999999999s)]
*  Is shocking how stupid people have gotten [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1165.28s)]
*  They don't read the entire tweet they see how Sanabia start typing yeah [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1172.3999999999999s)]
*  Is deliberate because the title is a bad first impression when people watch the video they're more likely to hear [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1178.48s)]
*  What was already mentioned in there therefore the title a blasting listener? Okay. Here's the thing [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1183.12s)]
*  If I were to watch something if I were to see a random account on Twitter without making any assessment [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1189.04s)]
*  whatsoever about like their politics or anything like that and [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1197.24s)]
*  I saw something that this account was posting that was [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1201.0s)]
*  Directly at odds with the proof that they posted in the video right underneath it [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1205.0s)]
*  I would just never treat this person seriously again. I would go [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1209.04s)]
*  Hey, there is a limited amount of time in my day where I am trying to process information as fast as possible and [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1213.1599999999999s)]
*  You have now wasted my time you have lied to me [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1221.12s)]
*  You have led me astray and you have done so in such a simple to understand manner that I will never treat you [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1225.56s)]
*  seriously ever again [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1234.08s)]
*  At least that's how I operate where I feel like if someone is [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1236.56s)]
*  If someone has wronged me if someone has wronged me in this regard then I will never trust them again [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1241.64s)]
*  You know or at least like if I'm gonna be charitable. I'll be like, okay, maybe this was wrong [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1247.3400000000001s)]
*  Maybe this person got it wrong, but next time I'll be a little bit more skeptical [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1252.44s)]
*  right [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1257.4s)]
*  And it blows my mind that people don't exercise that at all and I think part of the reason why people don't exercise this level [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1261.76s)]
*  Caution at all is [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1269.4399999999998s)]
*  Because everything is just stand culture. Everything's computer everything stand culture and what I mean by that is [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1271.8799999999999s)]
*  There are teams [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1281.12s)]
*  politics is boring and annoying and [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1283.48s)]
*  neither party actually [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1286.52s)]
*  Neither party actually represents people's interest. There's no need for [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1288.4399999999998s)]
*  Advancing a legislative agenda or anything like that. So it's just like my team is better than your team, right and [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1293.04s)]
*  Online it even goes beyond that like the boomers go. I'm team Democrat. I'm team Republican [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1298.92s)]
*  The zoomers go I'm team this content creator and whatever he believes [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1305.0s)]
*  Versus that content creator and whatever he believes his content creator doesn't like that other content creator [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1309.8000000000002s)]
*  So I have decided that that content creator is bad and everything that he believes is bad and wrong [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1314.8400000000001s)]
*  It's just stand culture all the way down [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1321.6000000000001s)]
*  but in that process [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1325.6000000000001s)]
*  I think a lot of people get duped [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1328.0800000000002s)]
*  Something that I've talked about quite frequently was with like sex pest in he right not only is it just I mean [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1331.1200000000001s)]
*  Not only is he an immoral person perhaps? [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1336.3200000000002s)]
*  Possibly engaging in criminal acts, right? [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1339.68s)]
*  but also he's wrong all the time and [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1342.3600000000001s)]
*  I know that he has has created this environment where he claims that I'm wrong all the time [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1346.6000000000001s)]
*  But like if you're getting your information from a guy like that or if you're getting your information from a guy like Hutch [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1353.28s)]
*  You are just gonna be constantly led astray and at a certain point you got to go. Why is [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1359.3600000000001s)]
*  My expectations designed around what this person is telling me not matching up with the reality in front of me [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1364.96s)]
*  Why is it that these guys were telling me Joe Biden shouldn't drop out and everyone is actually a radical [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1375.08s)]
*  Asshole for claiming Joe Biden should drop out all the way until Joe Biden literally dropped out [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1381.24s)]
*  Why is it that if I follow these guys, I'm always playing catch-up. I'm always wrong [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1386.64s)]
*  Why is it that there are no penalties for consistently [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1405.0s)]
*  Getting things wrong from the audiences that are demanding more and more [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1409.76s)]
*  Wrong information, I guess [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1417.0s)]
*  Like if someone if someone were to claim to be a political commentator and they got something so [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1425.2s)]
*  Spectacularly wrong. I would at least try to dig deep and analyze how they got it wrong, right? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1430.9199999999998s)]
*  And if that was consistent if they were consistently in the wrong [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1436.6000000000001s)]
*  Whether it be [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1443.0s)]
*  telling Biden not to drop out and that everyone is delusional for claiming that Biden is actually too old when obviously the [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1444.3600000000001s)]
*  Overwhelming majority of Americans were aware of this reality and then on top of that [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1450.4s)]
*  They were like Kamala Harris is running the best campaign possible. She shouldn't say anything about Israel Palestine [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1454.6000000000001s)]
*  And that also came out to be that also was a spectacular failure at a certain point at a certain point [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1459.16s)]
*  you have to [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1466.76s)]
*  Just certain point you have to recognize like maybe this guy isn't giving me the best possible opinion [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1468.8000000000002s)]
*  Maybe this guy is leading me astray. Do you want to be wrong all the time? [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1473.96s)]
*  I guess maybe maybe people would rather feel a sense of community and a shared [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1478.44s)]
*  Wrongness than to be right. I guess that's what it is [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1486.2800000000002s)]
*  What is this how to stay in culture manifest into politics from mothership four years ago? Oh my god [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1490.16s)]
*  This is a [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1495.28s)]
*  Incredible. I don't know who believes this stupid shit like this. I truly believe people are just too stupid to understand. They're being duped [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1497.08s)]
*  yeah, I guess I [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1502.24s)]
*  Still have confidence. I still have [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1504.44s)]
*  Confidence like you and Ukraine you acknowledge and examine where you were wrong [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1507.76s)]
*  Yeah, and not only was I that's the reason why I brought that up [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1511.0s)]
*  Like people always bring up the Ukraine take right like Russia will never invade Ukraine. First of all [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1514.72s)]
*  My like I was very transparent with where [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1520.6399999999999s)]
*  Like what I was analyzing I was very transparent of like what I was looking at right and [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1525.36s)]
*  How I arrived at this prediction which was wrong and I apologized immediately admitted I was wrong and [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1532.12s)]
*  And moved on and of course this was like what four years ago at this point, which is crazy [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1538.84s)]
*  But the the analysis there was still sound right [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1546.08s)]
*  the [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1551.56s)]
*  The only part of the the analysis there was sound the part of the problem was the assumption [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1552.84s)]
*  the principle that I have that I [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1559.04s)]
*  that I refused to [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1562.1999999999998s)]
*  entertain the notion of any [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1564.9599999999998s)]
*  Party involved in any conflict whatsoever, especially someone who is in charge of a state [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1567.32s)]
*  I I just don't go they're radical. They're insane. They're illogical, right? [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1572.8s)]
*  I think just simply saying well this person is crazy and they behave like this. I [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1577.48s)]
*  I don't think that that's [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1582.28s)]
*  appropriate when you're doing political commentary and that was my biggest mistake with Vladimir Putin was that there were obviously [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1584.8s)]
*  Additional motivators for him. I still think he was behaving in a rational manner, even though his actions are obviously wrong [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1592.28s)]
*  bloodthirsty and [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1600.16s)]
*  And ultimately illogical like there is still in his own mind. There are still competing interests there that I think [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1602.16s)]
*  Like someone's calculation can be wrong, but there's still a calculation and I think I I did not [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1609.9199999999998s)]
*  factor in competing motivations there for him to like actually [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1616.6s)]
*  Do this do this unjustifiable thing? [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1621.08s)]
*  It's so time that they have a point to February 2022 take of yours to show how you messed up when the guy's wrong all [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1623.96s)]
*  The time exactly but when you're this is another thing that I've mentioned though [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1629.04s)]
*  Cuz like if you're wrong in the direction of the State Department [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1632.3799999999999s)]
*  No one ever actually punishes you as a matter of fact, they literally promote you there is no punishments for being so severely and and [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1636.34s)]
*  spectacularly wrong [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1644.46s)]
*  That's not incorrect though. If someone was being charitable. Do you not think they'd accept that? What do you mean? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1646.18s)]
*  yeah, it was also weird cuz like it was also weird cuz [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1651.06s)]
*  People were making it seem like I invaded Ukraine [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1655.74s)]
*  You know what? [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1658.28s)]
*  I mean [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1658.62s)]
*  There's this like weird stank culture tendency of trying to greatly over emphasize the impact that a content creator has the content creator [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1658.86s)]
*  that you love or a content creator that you hate both parties do this and [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1666.16s)]
*  That's precisely the reason why you're experiencing or you're watching this unfold right now where people are trying to [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1671.44s)]
*  People are trying to actively tie back this guy that shot the [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1680.0s)]
*  the the [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1685.28s)]
*  Israeli [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1687.0s)]
*  diplomats back to me [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1688.24s)]
*  Aggressively, even though there is no like connection [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1690.3200000000002s)]
*  They are actively trying to do so in an effort to try and like create drama and in an effort to try and [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1693.84s)]
*  De-platform me which is so fucking stupid. It also betrays the seriousness of [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1700.32s)]
*  the conversation that you are choosing to have right [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1706.68s)]
*  it betrays the seriousness of the conversation the severity of the conversation that you're choosing to have if you're talking about like a [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1710.48s)]
*  Massive country invading another country and how fucking violent of an affair that is [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1717.56s)]
*  Your hyper focus on a twitch streamers [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1721.74s)]
*  Incorrect prediction is is so silly is so idiotic. Anyway, um same thing for for October 7 [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1724.3s)]
*  same thing for October 7 these communities basically [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1731.5s)]
*  worked tirelessly around the clock in the immediate aftermath of October 7 to try and find ways to make this about me to make [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1735.46s)]
*  To their ultimate like their higher highest order of priority was to deplatform me [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1742.98s)]
*  No care or consideration for taking like any sides on this at all and [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1748.58s)]
*  and and in the interest in serving that interest they basically started just [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1753.1s)]
*  finding [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1759.1s)]
*  Anything and everything they can clipping shit [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1760.22s)]
*  out of context over the course of like an entire year of [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1763.1s)]
*  coverage over this genocide in an effort to [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1767.3799999999999s)]
*  build this comprehensive database of like things that I don't believe or things that I do believe that is actually [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1770.78s)]
*  Incorrectly interpreted to create a deep sophisticated deplatforming mechanism and I think in the process a lot of a political people [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1777.14s)]
*  made up their minds on this issue and [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1785.26s)]
*  assigned like they they made up their minds on this issue and then they [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1788.5800000000002s)]
*  They decided that they're on one side. They're on the side of a content creator, right and [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1793.9s)]
*  And it's it's weird because like you should I still have this [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1800.38s)]
*  Opinion that I still have confidence in my fellow man [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1804.82s)]
*  Perhaps is misplaced but I still believe that like people are capable of making up their own minds on issues like this [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1809.22s)]
*  rather than letting their favorite contigueras hold their hands and developing a parasocial relationship and [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1816.74s)]
*  Having that be their substitute for for understanding the the world [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1823.1399999999999s)]
*  It's really sad that I don't think that that is going to take place [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1829.22s)]
*  Having said that however, having said that if there's one issue [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1832.74s)]
*  where [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1838.18s)]
*  There are organizations that are just as schizophrenic as like the online slop tuber [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1839.8600000000001s)]
*  Ecosystem that is willing to docks that's willing to clip things out of context that actually has [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1846.78s)]
*  Unlike the online slop tuber ecosystem. That's just simply doing Gamergate style harassment campaigns [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1853.06s)]
*  That that actually does have institutional prominence it is [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1859.42s)]
*  the [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1863.26s)]
*  pro israel advocacy organizations that masquerade as [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1864.3799999999999s)]
*  Jewish advocacy organizations or masquerade as organizations combating anti-semitism [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlswd9X9VkY&t=1869.26s)]
