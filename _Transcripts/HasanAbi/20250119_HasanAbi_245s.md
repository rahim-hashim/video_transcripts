**HasanAbi:** [January 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q)
*  When, when you go up for a layup and the person can't catch you and they just hit you directly, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=0.0s)]
*  they like slam your body on purpose to push you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=7.04s)]
*  They're doing that to make you land on your head. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=11.540000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=14.96s)]
*  They're doing that to you. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=15.96s)]
*  They're doing that to, to basically hurt you. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=17.44s)]
*  It's completely unacceptable. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=20.8s)]
*  I went to bed last night, woke up, played a crazy amount of basketball, had incredible [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=28.72s)]
*  runs, almost someone because they almost me on my runs. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=35.48s)]
*  There's this dude who just kept trucking me while I was in the air. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=41.16s)]
*  Like he would, he would pull up underneath me. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=44.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=46.64s)]
*  And the first time he did it, I fell on him and I was like, Hey, are you okay? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=47.64s)]
*  Like I was like, please don't do that. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  You know, you might get yourself hurt. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=53.56s)]
*  And he tried to do it again the second time. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=55.94s)]
*  And then when I landed, I was like, if you ever do that again, you're never going to [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=57.78s)]
*  be able to do that to another person ever again, like straight up a little bit. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=62.059999999999995s)]
*  I've never actually popped off on someone before on the basketball court like that. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=67.1s)]
*  I was like, listen, I'm 33 years old. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=71.34s)]
*  I'm not trying to, you know, I'm not trying to injure myself on the pavement here while [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=73.34s)]
*  playing pickup basketball on a Sunday. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=78.46s)]
*  I mean, I was valid though. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=80.38s)]
*  I was valid. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=81.53999999999999s)]
*  The first time I pressed someone on basketball, but it was like, especially because I was [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=82.58000000000001s)]
*  so kind to him the first time he did it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=86.26s)]
*  And then he did it the exact same way. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=88.5s)]
*  The second time as well. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=90.48s)]
*  It was completely unacceptable. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=92.62s)]
*  He apologized to careful. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=94.02000000000001s)]
*  I have old man bones. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=95.02000000000001s)]
*  No, dude, what are you talking about? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=96.58000000000001s)]
*  When when you go up for a layup and the person can't catch you and they just hit you directly, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=98.86000000000001s)]
*  they like slam your body on purpose to push you. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=105.46000000000001s)]
*  They're doing that to make you land on your head. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=109.98s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=113.30000000000001s)]
*  They're doing that to you. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=114.30000000000001s)]
*  They're doing that to, to basically hurt you. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=115.88000000000001s)]
*  It's completely unacceptable. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=119.24000000000001s)]
*  It's a flagrant foul. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=121.30000000000001s)]
*  It's especially ridiculous on pickup ball on pavement. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=123.14s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=126.94s)]
*  You probably tried tackling them. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=127.94s)]
*  No, I didn't. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=129.26s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=130.3s)]
*  I'm actually a very gentle giant anyway, but I loved it. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=131.3s)]
*  I loved it. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=135.94s)]
*  I explained a story. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=136.94s)]
*  You weren't there and you immediately assumed in your mind that I was probably still in [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=138.02s)]
*  the wrong somehow. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=142.57999999999998s)]
*  It's like one of the, one of the most basic, one of the most classic ways of, of engaging [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=144.42s)]
*  in a flagrant foul that virtually everyone universally understands is wrong and unacceptable. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=151.38s)]
*  And a chatter still was like, nah, you probably deserved it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=156.66s)]
*  A girl saw you playing basketball, POV, a sound biker and Josh was playing basketball [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=159.5s)]
*  at the park next to your house. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=163.54s)]
*  And you and your sister are insane. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=165.22s)]
*  Wait, should I do it? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=167.1s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=169.98s)]
*  Oh, I didn't even hear him. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=170.98s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=175.54s)]
*  Was this your inspiration for today's fit? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=176.7s)]
*  Yes, that was my inspiration. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=178.62s)]
*  Maybe tick tock should stay banned. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=180.54s)]
*  No, this is why tick tock shouldn't be banned. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=182.06s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=184.85999999999999s)]
*  This is why they want to ban it though. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=185.85999999999999s)]
*  At least they didn't get weird with it and follow you. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=186.85999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, true. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=189.26s)]
*  I am moment from yesterday. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=190.26s)]
*  She looks flabbergasted at you, but you probably got like for the bank that way too. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=191.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=196.3s)]
*  No, hey, hey, hey, leave it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=197.3s)]
*  Where did you find that? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=200.26000000000002s)]
*  Get out of there. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=201.26000000000002s)]
*  What is that? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=202.26000000000002s)]
*  Candy. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=203.26000000000002s)]
*  Someone just discarded their candy. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=204.26000000000002s)]
*  She's looking back at me. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=205.26000000000002s)]
*  Like how could you do that? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=206.26000000000002s)]
*  How could you spank me in my butt like that? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=211.26000000000002s)]
*  Just kidding. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=213.58s)]
*  I've reposted your thirst talks too much access denied. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=214.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=218.14000000000001s)]
*  Why did the message on tick tock mention Trump? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=219.14000000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=220.94000000000003s)]
*  Because he's saying he wants to save it and tick tock is glazing him so that, you know, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=221.94s)]
*  they don't get banned. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=227.62s)]
*  Hello. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=228.62s)]
*  It's in his hands now. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=229.62s)]
*  Why are people so the thing I don't understand is like, why are people so weird about why [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMDi0olT-Q&t=232.82s)]
