# L.A. Wildfires: The Risk Of Spreading From Strong Winds | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ)
*  How bad would a hundred mile winds be at this point? It would be devastating. It would have [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=0.0s)]
*  already lit. It would have carried embers all the way onto all of these houses. Wind [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=4.98s)]
*  is always wind is always devastating in these fires. It carries them miles and miles away. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=11.02s)]
*  Potentially. It makes it infinitely more difficult to put out only LA city. I mean, we LA County, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=17.06s)]
*  of course as well, but the mutual aid and these fire departments that are [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=22.72s)]
*  not knowing where they're moving on both sides of that same hilltop where on the one hand it's [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=26.24s)]
*  going into Brentwood on the other hand it's going into Encino. It's pretty terrifying stuff. I know [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=37.2s)]
*  a lot of people that live on both sides of the parish. So let's hope that is an indication that [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=44.08s)]
*  maybe a lot of people did heed the warnings and get out. But the fact that the numbers are so far [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=49.4s)]
*  as low as they are is quite remarkable when you think about the scale and scope of these fires [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=55.559999999999995s)]
*  and we say fires plural that we've been dealing with in Southern California. Well, Sheriff Luna [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=61.72s)]
*  did point out that the majority of the cases that they have and yeah winds are gonna pick up on [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=66.92s)]
*  Sunday Monday again in the deaths that these are people who had chosen not to evacuate. So a lot [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=71.6s)]
*  of the you know even the personal stories that we have heard from some people who have tragically [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=79.32s)]
*  died their their family members had seen them prior to them evacuating themselves. Oh this is [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=84.96s)]
*  vice that from incarceration to firefighter. And then after all was said and done they asked crews [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=92.0s)]
*  to go back there and unfortunately had seen and ended in a very tragic way. We're looking at [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=101.52s)]
*  this this picture now which actually looks a little better. I pause a little bit because it [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=111.28s)]
*  looks good and then all of a sudden we see another loom up. This is a show about incarcerated [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=118.52s)]
*  firefighters. That's crazy. Just a beautiful a beautiful sight when you see that bright red. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=124.36s)]
*  Yeah here it's moving towards Brentwood as well. My old stomping grounds. This is into putting [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=130.6s)]
*  at the fire. We saw a lot of smoke there and then in an instant they're able to put out a big chunk [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=137.48s)]
*  of the flames that could be racing towards homes. And that has been the theme that we've seen in fire [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=145.16s)]
*  after fire since those initial two fires started on Tuesday in Palisades and Altadena. Initially [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=150.6s)]
*  the they couldn't fly because there was just too windy and and we saw the results of that. We also [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=158.64s)]
*  saw the lack of water on the ground that made things harder. But since then we have seen really [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=164.6s)]
*  urgent massive flare-ups that look incredibly threatening. And obviously this one got to [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=171.56s)]
*  property there. But we saw this in West Hills. We saw it in the Hollywood Hills. And we saw it [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=177.64s)]
*  really last night as the fire approached Mountain Gate and approached other parts of Mandeville [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=184.84s)]
*  Canyon that they were able to stop it because of the air resources that they have. It is the most [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=190.72s)]
*  effective resources that they have is what we've seen from the air. They can drop the most amount [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=196.32s)]
*  of water or Foscheck on really quickly and they are effective but unfortunately not for this [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=200.56s)]
*  particular homeowner here. This graphic. Oh my god ain't no way. That's a penis. This is the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=206.48s)]
*  That's just a penis. South Anna Santa Anna winds pick up Saturday night into Sunday morning in [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=214.48s)]
*  Southern California but possibly a strong wind event in is coming early next week as the wildfires [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=221.84s)]
*  continue. It is crazy that like geographically I don't know. I mean I guess like the way that [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=226.56s)]
*  at Los Angeles is located in in between all these like mountains. Those sorts of winds don't end up [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=235.35999999999999s)]
*  impacting like the metropolitan the greater metropolitan area is wild [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=242.4s)]
*  but it just literally surrounds [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=252.0s)]
*  is just straight up punishing the valley punishing all the way out to [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=258.08s)]
*  all the way out to the to the water side on like Malibu and Pacific Palisades. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=262.56s)]
*  Things could change of course. Oh my god. Hemet mama we made it bro. This is the worst way to be [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=266.4s)]
*  recognized. You know this is the worst way to be recognized. What is this? You are the media now [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=273.76s)]
*  3 26 p.m. 1 10 25. Wait what I heard from my brother a firefighter in central Oregon that 60 [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=283.35999999999996s)]
*  fire trucks in the state sent support to L.A. fires are being held in the state. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=291.28s)]
*  In the state sent support to L.A. fires are being held up in Sacramento for emissions [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=294.4s)]
*  testing. They likely won't pass inspection and won't be able to help. What a joke. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=297.52s)]
*  The Oregon strike teams arrived Thursday and are assigned to the Pacific Palisades fire. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=302.32s)]
*  11 of the teams began their assignments this a.m. The teams are motivated committed and excited. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=306.56s)]
*  What do you mean? Yeah this guy is just stupid and wrong. What are you talking about? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=311.44s)]
*  Oh the joke is that you are the media now as in people just lie and then those lies go super viral [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=316.24s)]
*  and then like here you have [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=328.32s)]
*  left post just needs a few more likes before Elon. This is a crazy quote tweet. Yeah it's so nutty [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=333.76s)]
*  dude. It's so nutty. Look at this. Look look these guys are actually working on the ground already. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=341.04s)]
*  This guy hours later is already this guy hours after hours after they've already posted about it. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=346.64000000000004s)]
*  Oh my god. Oh my god. Linda Yoccarino. Oregon sent 60 fire trucks to California. California won't let [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=353.6s)]
*  them into the state because California is unsure of emissions on the trucks. California's a joke. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=365.04s)]
*  Get out while you can. We sent 75 fire engines. Your statement about our teams not being allowed [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=368.32s)]
*  into California is false. Our teams arrived yesterday and are working around the clock to help our [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=372.48s)]
*  neighbors. Dude I'm telling you right now. I'm telling you right now these people are they have [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=375.76s)]
*  to be doing this deliberately. They have to be doing this deliberately. They just straight up. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=382.4s)]
*  They straight up want you to not trust any real resources. I don't think this is incompetence. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=387.76s)]
*  I think this has to be malicious dude. I think this has to be malicious. It is so psychotic. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=395.04s)]
*  It feels like we talk about TikTok right. We talk about TikTok and how like the Chinese influence [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=402.16s)]
*  on TikTok is so pervasive and how this is terrifying for American national security. We [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=408.24s)]
*  have national security concerns and it's like but look at this. We're doing it to ourselves. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=414.16s)]
*  We're doing it to ourselves with some of the wealthiest most powerful individuals on the [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=419.76s)]
*  planet. Like this is so insane dude. How how can people not recognize that this right here [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=424.0s)]
*  is terrifying? Okay virtually all the information that you get on Twitter [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=433.04s)]
*  about anything at this point at least like the first five top performing posts are just going [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=440.16s)]
*  to be straight up lies that right wingers have just concocted. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=446.8s)]
*  And now Facebook is like yeah we're going to fire our moderation team like as though [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=455.12s)]
*  as though they have anything but just a eye slop on there anyway. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=460.08000000000004s)]
*  Genuinely breaking the brains of all of your elderly family members all your elderly relatives. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=464.0s)]
*  But it is so this has to be malicious. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=470.8s)]
*  Yeah finally a community note arrives on the original post hours later after it already had [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=475.68s)]
*  a couple million views and thousands of retweets at 48,000 likes. It gets hit with a community note [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=479.84s)]
*  and now a deletion and retraction which I'll give him credit for doing more than many but rings [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=486.64s)]
*  hollow after posting his brother in Oregon farm and just told him the trucks were being held up [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=490.56s)]
*  and claimed this was email chief email from the chief confirming they're stuck in emissions [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=494.88s)]
*  inspection. Good morning all to chief it's my understanding of the 60 apparatus that were sent [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=498.48s)]
*  to California are sitting in Sacramento when it be expected it is sad that there's not a better [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=505.84000000000003s)]
*  process to be able to render aid to those in need. I hope the organ is better prepared if the [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=509.28000000000003s)]
*  situation is ever reversed. It seems like it worked pretty well no [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=512.48s)]
*  could be faster but the alternative is what exactly [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=528.32s)]
*  Hank Green says I cannot overemphasize how much of you are seeing a distorted version of reality [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=539.2s)]
*  in which the world is ruled by incompetence and evil if you see everything through the lens of [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=542.88s)]
*  Elon tweets rather than actually engaging with your community. It's so this is so devastating. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=545.9200000000001s)]
*  It's a larger point that I'm going to be talking about with Mark Zuckerberg as well and what these [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=551.6800000000001s)]
*  billionaires are doing but it is genuinely it is genuinely shocking. I'm still kind of surprised [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=556.32s)]
*  Republicans still bother with ASL interpreters at the rallies and stuff seems like the seems [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=562.8000000000001s)]
*  like the kind of effeminate woke nonsense they'd have to rid themselves of. What is this? I'm sorry [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=566.48s)]
*  but we have to stop with the ridiculous sign language interpreters who turn serious press [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=572.32s)]
*  conferences into a farce. There are closed captions on all broadcast channels and streaming [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=575.36s)]
*  services no wild human gesticulators necessary. Oh my god. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=579.12s)]
*  Oh my god Christopher Ruffo saw this and was like yeah it's time to eliminate disability access. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=586.16s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=594.5600000000001s)]
*  That's amazing. They just have no policies. It's just purely making things worse. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=599.92s)]
*  What a wild turn of events man. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=609.76s)]
*  Yeah I saw this as well. Rogan's podcasting conspiracies and now it's just basically [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=621.12s)]
*  laundering the reputations of super villains. Yeah I 100% agree with this take. I've been [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=625.12s)]
*  very frustrated about this as well. I'm going to be talking about this in a little bit as well [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=632.08s)]
*  but like this man went from conspiracy theories that like sometimes are anti-government [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=636.5600000000001s)]
*  to basically having exclusively billionaire super villain defense contractors dude. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=644.1600000000001s)]
*  And it's crazy because these are the people who think this is independent media. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=655.6800000000001s)]
*  Like his audience is comprised of so many normies your co-workers who are like I don't trust [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=660.32s)]
*  mainstream news brother and there's like valid reasons not to trust certain narratives in [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=666.16s)]
*  mainstream news. Okay but it's crazy to me that those guys then go and listen to a conversation [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=670.48s)]
*  with a super villain billionaire who is laundering his reputation in broad daylight by talking to Joe [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=678.24s)]
*  Rogan someone that you like and half the time they're also talking about like you know defense [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=685.92s)]
*  contractor shit. It blows my mind like what do you mean if CNN when CNN does interviews like this [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=691.8399999999999s)]
*  you go aw what the hell these guys love the elites but when Joe Rogan does it it's like oh no he [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=699.5999999999999s)]
*  loves the elites in a cool way. I love this elite as well. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=705.92s)]
*  It's just so it's it's so annoying it's so annoying it's so everything is so broken [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=715.92s)]
*  beyond beyond a state of repair you know it's just I don't know. This has grown things have [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=730.8s)]
*  grown nothing has burned down in like a half a century. Wow. So there's so much vegetation [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=738.64s)]
*  so much growth there there's a lot of fuel to burn. Sam Dubin can you hear us now? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=743.52s)]
*  Yeah Alex you hear me? I can although I heard I heard myself too so I don't know if there's a way [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=750.56s)]
*  to to anyways we were talking about. If you guys can hear me I'm just gonna start talking here so [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=756.0799999999999s)]
*  we're up here on Dirtmo Holland which is a fire road up here in the Santa Monica mountains. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=761.4399999999999s)]
*  That right up there is just above Mandeville Canyon that is the Nike missile sites it's a [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=766.64s)]
*  former missile site that was used in the cold war and now it is a park and you have a lot of [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=772.56s)]
*  firefighters up there taking a stand it looks like they were possibly able to protect it and just [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=778.64s)]
*  below down here is Mandeville Canyon you can see the red from the the drops these takers have been [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=783.36s)]
*  making and it's all white smoke right now which is a very good thing and then just below here is [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=789.76s)]
*  Mandeville Canyon and where the fire currently is is that is the Gardenland fire road it's a fire [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=796.24s)]
*  road that goes from Mandeville Canyon it goes up to those power lines and up to Westridge which is [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=801.76s)]
*  just up to the left here but that's where the flame is right now and then here is Mandeville Canyon [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=806.64s)]
*  you can see the homes down here in Mandeville Canyon looks okay right now I don't know about [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=811.6s)]
*  the top part of it but that is Mandeville Canyon right down there and it looks okay at the bottom [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=817.2s)]
*  part so far and then this is Mountain Gate up here which is where Alaska's was live [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=822.16s)]
*  last night and so far the fire has not made its way there there's a ton of firefighters there [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=828.3199999999999s)]
*  and there's another trail let me step back really quick this is the Canyon back trail and it's [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=834.0s)]
*  normally a very narrow trail and the bulldozers have just come in and plowed it completely all [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=839.12s)]
*  the way to Mountain Gate so you can see that they're taking a very very hard stance here [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=844.0799999999999s)]
*  more resources up here but right before you from what I understand by the way at least like the [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=849.68s)]
*  people I've talked to Gavin Newsom is very bad when it comes to you know eviscerating the homeless [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=856.3199999999999s)]
*  that much I will always have smoke for him for but as far as like funding firefighting at the state [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=862.3199999999999s)]
*  level people don't have that much anger and resentment towards Gavin Newsom for the record [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=867.92s)]
*  so if you're looking at the Podjons interview with him if you're looking at the Podjons [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=874.48s)]
*  interview with him like Gavin Newsom's mismanagement is not the major story in [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=879.6s)]
*  this situation as much as it is like as much as it is a local problem as much as it is a LA [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=885.2s)]
*  specific problem like I would rather have smoke for Karen Bass than Gavin Newsom on this particular [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=893.84s)]
*  subject even though he's obviously a magnet for this kind of hatred as well because he's such a [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=899.44s)]
*  nationally known liberal figurehead obviously has a tendency to go on television and put himself [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=905.2s)]
*  out there like this but as far as as far as like adequate funding and adequate spending on [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=914.0s)]
*  Cal Fire and like statewide initiatives from what I understand he actually greatly increased the [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=920.1600000000001s)]
*  spending on on you know wildfire prevention and things of that nature at the state level [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=925.76s)]
*  so overall I think there are plenty of things that you can criticize [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=934.3199999999999s)]
*  Gavin Newsom for there are plenty of things you can criticize him for especially as it pertains to [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=939.04s)]
*  homelessness especially as it pertains to his his his mighty pen that he uses specifically to veto [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=944.48s)]
*  so many initiatives that people vote for democratically but never actually end up getting [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=953.6800000000001s)]
*  this is not one of them [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=960.24s)]
*  he's essentially being blamed for an uncontrollable firestorm that could have not been prevented no [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=965.76s)]
*  matter how much you fund the fire department yeah I like I'll say it that I say like this and I did [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=969.36s)]
*  bring this up as well I did bring this up as well even with Karen Bass like [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=975.6800000000001s)]
*  as it pertains to the mismanagement that the LA Fire Department got right additional additional [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=979.44s)]
*  management or additional funds would it have been able to actually successfully combat this fire I [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=989.6800000000001s)]
*  don't think so right because it's such a it's it's a natural disaster right like it's it certainly [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=994.96s)]
*  would be better okay and there is absolutely anger and resentment that you can direct towards [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1003.84s)]
*  the local governance and the mismanagement in this process but as far as like as far as you know [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1012.0s)]
*  funding initiatives and and and trying to figure out what went wrong here I as far as I understand [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1020.0s)]
*  I don't think Gavin Newsom is as responsible [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1026.88s)]
*  for this I mean a lot of fires before this one were because he didn't enforce energy [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1032.88s)]
*  infrastructure maintenance I don't think he's the biggest culprit for this specifically though [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1036.88s)]
*  there is also truth to that for sure to get on the fire quickly I mean we think about [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1040.72s)]
*  the private firefighters during that first fire night on Tuesday night there were blocks [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1046.4s)]
*  and blocks burning where there were no firefighters to be seen for hours and that's part of the reason [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1052.64s)]
*  that this got to be as big and as bad as it was in terms of the devastation yeah not having [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1058.8s)]
*  not having enough firefighters in this situation is partially because we just don't have enough [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1064.6399999999999s)]
*  firefighters to deal with not one not two but three and sometimes even four wildfires at 80 [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1070.32s)]
*  mile winds okay but the successful way to ensure that there is at least as much prevention as [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1078.3999999999999s)]
*  possible is to have a very well funded fire department with enough hands with enough [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1086.8s)]
*  trained individuals I hate you communists so much yeah that's this is the fault of communism [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1094.3999999999999s)]
*  and and communist in general you're right so now that we have these curfews in the various [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1102.24s)]
*  fire zones curfew in effect from six in the evening to six in the morning we had those [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1108.8799999999999s)]
*  two press conferences this morning and there were no reports of looting although they were [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1115.68s)]
*  very serious about anyone who violated that curfew and was found walking around a couple of arrests [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1121.3600000000001s)]
*  of people just seen walking around the area and then yeah they took them into custody because [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1129.44s)]
*  because in order to get into these areas you really have to to to be very creative [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1137.28s)]
*  because these these security checkpoints are are are very tight so and we saw that yesterday [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1145.76s)]
*  in this area especially in pacific palisades on on sunset near a malphi they have these just long [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1153.1200000000001s)]
*  lineups of cars that are just waiting for hours to get to get into the neighborhood i mean [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1161.12s)]
*  people were telling our reporters last night they're waiting six plus hours to try to get home [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1169.28s)]
*  yeah and it is you know i mean it's frustrating for a lot of people to see that and but then you [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1174.7199999999998s)]
*  get into these areas once you get in and it's just it's so stunning right to see to see the [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1183.1999999999998s)]
*  destruction up close yeah lots of folks having a tough time getting in too because people escaped [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1188.64s)]
*  and escaped at a moment's notice and they didn't have any of their id they don't have a property [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1193.8400000000001s)]

*  i got to get in there and everybody's got their own thing and and when you think about the multiplying [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1278.56s)]
*  effect bob of how many people are impacted at one time how overwhelming that is for frankly our [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1283.6s)]
*  system of government services which is not exactly known for working so great for people yeah and not [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1292.9599999999998s)]
*  exactly known for its customer service track record and now to have this overflowing of the system [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1299.28s)]
*  is is really overwhelming and and i think part of the challenge in the days ahead you know you [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1307.1999999999998s)]
*  think of day one day two we're in crisis mode everybody's very forgiving and understanding [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1313.44s)]
*  we start getting in day three four five six seven four the longest dead end road in los angeles so [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1318.72s)]

*  burn area i'm going to go all the way up to the dead end here you can then understand why this [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1330.72s)]
*  area is under evacuation do you still talk to alex sometimes of the burns he always wants me to go [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1336.16s)]
*  but i never have time and earlier this morning if i zoom in here is where a home burned just off of [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1341.6799999999998s)]
*  mandyville canyon to the west side up in this area is where we lost a structure all of it again west [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1348.1599999999999s)]
*  of the 405 freeway west of the mountain gate community for those of people interested here [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1353.6s)]
*  is where the getty is located right there off the 405 maybe gives you some perspective of what we're [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1358.0s)]
*  looking at what's at risk this morning as this fire continues to burn our coverage continuing [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1363.84s)]
*  right now with reporter kevin ozabek who is in the elix is the elix is the host of fox 11 that [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1368.72s)]
*  you can hear into the conversation right now you know that we've got serious winds coming tonight [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1375.28s)]
*  right yeah there's still a forecast to come and get a little bit stronger much stronger than what [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1380.72s)]
*  they are now we've been kind of fortunate when we were talking about the winds and we got a little [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1386.48s)]
*  bit of a break right from last night to this morning really we're we've been seeing these winds [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1391.84s)]
*  nearing 10 to 20 miles an hour wind gusts a little bit stronger at times and we'll be talking about [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1398.56s)]
*  these pockets where the winds are a little bit stronger and one of those pockets include that [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1403.44s)]
*  mandyville canyon area where things are a little bit gustier and of course we talk about how the [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1409.12s)]
*  fire will create its own wind and can get more erratic and get stronger in that area but because [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1415.12s)]
*  the winds have been 20 30 40 mile per hour wind gusts at times very easily one of those embers [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1420.56s)]
*  from the fires can get carried downwind and i think that's what happened there with that home [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1428.64s)]
*  unfortunately that burned in mandyville canyon looking elsewhere just a quick pan around orange [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1434.0s)]
*  county lighter winds here we've got some of the brightly colored areas here through parts of the [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1440.4s)]
*  inland empire corona specifically 18 to 20 miles an hour all right this is the brantwood canyon [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1445.76s)]
*  he's standing there in position ready to go and he just decided hey those flames down right below [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1452.0800000000002s)]
*  they're getting a little too close for comfort as they go up the hill so he decided to take action [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1457.28s)]
*  and we can see him now just dumping so much water over there and a good sign we love to see that [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1461.6000000000001s)]
*  white smoke right so just kind of interesting to see the firefight from this perspective as we are [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1467.1200000000001s)]
*  literally above it mark and irene it is very interesting to see their strategy on how they [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1471.76s)]
*  handle each individual home i mean earlier we were also hearing chainsaws kevin and they already have [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1477.44s)]
*  the defensible space but i'm assuming that they were trying to clear additional brush and vegetation [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1483.36s)]
*  that could have posed a threat to this home [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1488.16s)]
*  yes yes and that's kind of what they're doing here they're looking at the brush because if you look [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1494.32s)]
*  around even though so much has burned already and this palisades fire has just taken acre after acre [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1498.8s)]
*  i mean just look to the right of those flames and where all that smoke is coming up there's more [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1505.6s)]
*  vegetation there is still a lot of fuel up here so that's why this is not going to end anytime soon [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1510.24s)]
*  and that's why this has already been such a long firefight and why this is going to be continuing [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1515.68s)]
*  to be such a long firefight because there is just so much so so much brush that can still be burned [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1521.2s)]
*  there's still just so much brush that is so vulnerable right now and so much of it about [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1526.88s)]
*  conserving the water the firefighter was telling us earlier no need to waste the water if they're [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1531.44s)]
*  there if they can control it and look if it burns now and they're there that means it's not going [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1536.0800000000002s)]
*  to burn again so uh and you saw that firefighter right there almost loses footing kind of speaks [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1540.4s)]
*  to the terrain and the conditions that they're working in all of it is so interesting i know [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1544.88s)]
*  when we go to a fire and you're on scene you kind of look to the posture of the firefighters and see [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1548.72s)]
*  you know how are they moving what is their concern level and seeing these guys here it almost makes [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1554.64s)]
*  you feel a little reassured that they're ready they're prepared they got their hoses and when [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1561.36s)]
*  needed they use them but they're not blasting the water which perhaps you know speaks to the [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1565.92s)]
*  situation speaks to the lack of an intense wind event right now because we know the wind is going [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1571.68s)]
*  to increase more kevin that being said have firefighters at all conveyed to you any need [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1577.68s)]
*  to leave the area or they think you're okay [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1584.64s)]
*  so here off of westridge these homes mark we've not seen any residents we've not seen any homeowners [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1590.88s)]
*  here i think most people have already left because these flames are so close to some of their homes [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1596.0800000000002s)]
*  so i do have to kind of just to kind of jump up of what you were saying about how strategic this [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1601.52s)]
*  is even though i mean we are feet away from homes here these flames i mean so close so close i mean [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1606.96s)]
*  this fire is in a residential area but there's no frantic energy from these firefighters there's no [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1611.9199999999998s)]
*  panic they are cool calm and collected as they kind of get in their position how bad with 100 [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1617.44s)]
*  mile how bad would 100 mile winds be at this point it would be devastating it would have already lit [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1623.36s)]
*  it would have carried embers all the way onto all of these houses wind is always wind is always [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1632.72s)]
*  devastating in these fires it carries them miles and miles away potentially it makes it infinitely [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1639.3600000000001s)]
*  more difficult to put out only la city i mean we la county of course as well but the mutual [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1646.24s)]

*  because the winds are going to pick up again you've been monitoring this situation what is this [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1663.0400000000002s)]

*  they doing oh that's right they're uh cutting propaganda let's take a look to put out the [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1893.6799999999998s)]
*  palisades fire this is the santa nes reservoir it's the water supply basically for the palisades [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1897.84s)]
*  when they first started fighting the palisades fire they ran out of water extremely quickly [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1904.0s)]
*  wednesday 3 a.m they were basically out and there's been a lot of talk on why this happened so how [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1908.9599999999998s)]
*  long has this reservoir been empty for since february of last year there was no communication [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1914.0s)]
*  from the department of water and power to lafd that there was a water supply issue the firefighters [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1921.1999999999998s)]
*  when they were started fighting the fires no one informed them that the reservoir was empty this [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1927.6s)]
*  reservoir holds 117 million gallons of it's it's what's crazy about this part of the story is like [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1932.8s)]
*  yeah the reservoir is empty because of a thing that your donors don't want okay uh the reservoir [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1943.4399999999998s)]
*  is empty because of a thing that your donors don't want to recognize the the thing that like the [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1951.76s)]
*  foreign press uh the free presses donors don't want to recognize which is a a historically a [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1956.4s)]
*  historically dry wet season that was supposed to bring in at least some semblance of rain [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1962.5600000000002s)]
*  but it never did water the fire department was using a water i'm not even entirely certain that [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1969.76s)]
*  like the fire hydrant water is coming from this reservoir anyway supply from three backup tanks [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1974.96s)]
*  each one only holding one million gallons of water they say it's closed for maintenance to repair [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1979.76s)]
*  the lid that's on top of it i don't know a lot about reservoir maintenance but there's literally [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1985.12s)]
*  no wait what do you mean you don't know a lot about reservoir maintenance so why are you covering this [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1989.4399999999998s)]
*  story so all you did was just drive over to the reservoir and just show that it's like [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=1994.2399999999998s)]
*  dumped out you're not doing journalism then investigate man figure it out like this doesn't [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2001.12s)]
*  actually end up informing me at all it ends up diluting people further construction materials [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2008.32s)]
*  are vehicles anywhere in sight also with a reservoir like this you can refill it or [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2016.1599999999999s)]
*  start to refill it so another question is if they saw the santa annawins were coming [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2022.24s)]
*  and we have this remarkably dry wet season why was there no attempt to start refilling it back up [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2026.96s)]
*  i know i threw a lot out there but i think we need okay these are great questions if you are [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2033.36s)]
*  a real journalist your job is to either a go to gavin newsome's office and direct gavin newsome [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2039.76s)]
*  with these questions or b go to people that work in water management either in the state of california [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2047.4399999999998s)]
*  or outside of the state of california and direct these questions at knowledgeable people to find [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2056.7999999999997s)]
*  out what the answer is rather than leaving it as a question in your commentary where the initial [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2063.2s)]
*  hypothesis is that there is mismanagement about i don't really understand it but i'm simply asking [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2071.04s)]
*  questions like you're not a journalist if you do this you are supposed to not leave these questions [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2076.7999999999997s)]
*  the point of journalism is not to just go oh i'm just curious it's to actually you know a piece of [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2082.0s)]
*  curiosity that people have is to actually go and ask the people who are in positions of power [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2089.6s)]
*  those exact same questions it's to do some kind of research ahead of time so that when they actually [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2096.08s)]
*  respond to you you can figure out the the inconsistencies in their answers and direct [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2103.68s)]
*  secondary questions that's what journalism is supposed to be can you imagine the the adage the [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2109.68s)]
*  old adage of of journalism is a journalist duty is not to hear from one party that it is raining [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2116.56s)]
*  outside at another party that it's not raining outside and then just write it as though these [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2125.2s)]
*  both sides both sides are saying you know different things about the rain a journalist's duty is to [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2130.08s)]
*  open the window and look outside if it's raining or not okay this is akin to basically not even [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2134.88s)]
*  doing any of those things and simply stating people have a lot of questions on whether it's [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2143.52s)]
*  raining or not outside i have those questions as well [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2148.88s)]
*  homosexuals say that it's not raining outside what do you guys think [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2156.48s)]
*  you didn't do journalism [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2164.56s)]
*  it's so frustrating and these guys also masquerade as though they're like a reputable news outlet that has some semblance of independence as well because they're online [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2173.52s)]

*  salting the earth which ends up creating drier vegetation more fuel down the line [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2287.2s)]
*  but outside of that outside of that it also is corrosive to everything that's down there [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2294.7999999999997s)]

*  and it's already started especially because the pacific palisades is like a relatively well off [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2477.28s)]
*  neighborhood a lot of the surrounding areas a lot of the surrounding areas that have homes in [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2482.4s)]

*  inflated rental market prices if a single-family home for like six people to eight people is going [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2496.1600000000003s)]

*  and this is so toxic we spoke again to health expert and a doctor about the [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2526.0s)]
*  unhealthy very dangerous air quality actually outside particularly for those who have [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2533.2000000000003s)]
*  the fires haven't even been put down and there's still people doing craziness like that disease [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2543.52s)]
*  this is just detrimental and if you don't this can certainly cause those kinds of things so [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2548.0s)]
*  we encourage you to limit your activity outside just just get in your car and go and get to where [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2554.96s)]
*  you need to go i had a call from my son's coach about basketball practice and i said no absolutely [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2561.52s)]
*  not unless you're inside in a gym this is just very bad air quality all across the board not [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2567.92s)]
*  just where the fires are burning but across so cal from ventura south into orange county the [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2575.84s)]
*  inland empire i heard you talk about the um you know most destructive and the cost i looked at [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2581.92s)]
*  these numbers here campfire is where we go right with the number one deadliest costliest fire in [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2589.76s)]
*  the state of california and that burned what over 18 structures almost 20 000 structures [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2595.84s)]
*  eaten fire is the second one with 7 000 structures right now tubs fire in 2017 you might remember [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2603.2000000000003s)]
*  that palisades now i added the one because we saw with our very own eyes as it burned that home [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2609.6s)]
*  so over 5 000 structures but some preliminary estimates which by the way the campfire they've [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2617.36s)]
*  been talking about maybe 12 and a half billion dollars yeah and that's paradise for people that [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2623.8399999999997s)]
*  may be more familiar with that that town of paradise that was basically wiped off the map [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2628.7999999999997s)]
*  in that moment so many hundreds of people died in that fire they've adjusted for inflation is [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2633.36s)]
*  something like 12 and a half billion dollars but now when we talk about the palisades fire [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2638.96s)]
*  where you see those multi-million dollar homes i mean just the fires all together they're saying [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2644.96s)]
*  some estimates of 100 150 billion potentially dollars lost in these fires so it's just staggering [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2650.4s)]
*  yeah staggering it is i tried to get a specific answer from governor newsome on that and he said [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2661.44s)]
*  it's way too early to tell and if we start throwing around numbers it's everybody's just [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2666.48s)]
*  sort of guessing but he said because he had been to the campfire paradise with with president trump [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2669.92s)]
*  the head of cal fire i talked to also yesterday had been to the campfire and they both said that [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2677.52s)]
*  what you see in pacific palace when you look at the scope of it that it's the worst fire that [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2682.56s)]
*  they've ever been to wow and in terms of just the the scene and how upsetting it is to see it up [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcXgXsjrzQ&t=2687.36s)]
