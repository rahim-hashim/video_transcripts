*  we can still you can be basically in the middle of the conversation like you can be in Malibu [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr3DCRpDciU&t=68.64s)]
*  where people are saying looting is happening and even if you don't see any looting happening you [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr3DCRpDciU&t=74.0s)]
