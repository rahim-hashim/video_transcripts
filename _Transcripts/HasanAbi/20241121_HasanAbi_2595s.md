# Matt Gaetz Withdraws From Attorney General Consideration | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [November 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg)
*  Anyway, it don't really matter because while I don't think Matt Gates is political career is over, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=0.0s)]
*  Kamala Harris is certainly over. If the democratic party elevates Kamala Harris to another thing, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=5.28s)]
*  to another position, I'm so done. I just, Oh God, they're going to do it. They're going to try to [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  like make her run for California governor or maybe make her run again. They're going to make Kamala [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=16.48s)]
*  Harris run again. Matt Gates, weirdly enough has withdrawn from the race or not even the race, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=21.12s)]
*  but the appointment that Donald Trump gave him as attorney general withdrawn his nomination for [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=32.96s)]
*  attorney general. But Dana, this comes about 45 minutes after we reached out to him about some new [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=39.44s)]
*  reporting that we have. And this new reporting is that there was a second sexual encounter between [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=45.12s)]
*  him and an underage woman at a party in 2017. Now I have covered the investigation and allegations [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=52.0s)]
*  that the congressman may have had sex with a minor for four years now. And Dana, this was the first [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=59.04s)]
*  time that we had learned that the underage woman had testified to a second sexual encounter. And I [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=63.67999999999999s)]
*  learned from my sources, along with our colleague, Sarah Ferris, that she had testified to this, to [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=69.92s)]
*  the house ethics committee. Now I want to read our story again, this announcement that he is [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=75.04s)]
*  withdrawing comes as a bit of a surprise. We reached out to him 45 minutes ago to give him a chance [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=79.36s)]
*  to weigh in on this story. And again, his withdrawal comes just a short time after CNN reached out about [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=84.88s)]
*  our reporting that there was a second underage woman is, I feel like underage woman is, is like, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  I don't know, am I, am I the one friend who's too woke when I get like annoyed when people say that? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=98.24s)]
*  Just say minor, you know, I feel like it's kind of a weird way to phrase that is like, why are you [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  saying underage woman? Just, just say minor, like you could say child, but if you're going to maintain [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=108.96s)]
*  like journalistic standards, then you should at least say minor. That the alleged underage victim [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=116.39999999999999s)]
*  testified to, because teenager can imply 18 or 19, which was the first teenager that he paid to have [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=123.84s)]
*  sex with her age was I believe 18 or 19. But the second one that the first girl actually came out [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=132.0s)]
*  and, and, and alleged to was 17 to the house ethics committee. Now let me read you our reporting, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=139.6s)]
*  Dana, the alleged underage victim has testified that both of these actual encounters, the one [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=147.76s)]
*  that we always knew about and this new one occurred at the same party in Florida in 2017. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=153.36s)]
*  And Dan, I am told that she gave consistent testimony in both the ethics investigation [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=159.04000000000002s)]
*  and a civil lawsuit in Florida. Now I want to note that the justice department investigated these [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=163.60000000000002s)]
*  allegations that Gates had sex with a minor and did not charge him. He has always denied wrongdoing [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=168.8s)]
*  and we reached out to him 45 minutes ago to get a reaction to this. He did not offer us a statement. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=173.84s)]
*  Instead, we're seeing that he is now withdrawing. Now I want to note that what's notable about [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=178.48s)]
*  this testimony is that the underage woman testified that the second sexual encounter [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=183.67999999999998s)]
*  also involved another adult woman. Now the adult woman has denied that there was a threesome. Gates [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=188.79999999999998s)]
*  has always denied that he had sex with a minor. But of course this new reporting was coming as [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=196.0s)]
*  president elect Trump was trying to shore up support on Capitol Hill to get Gates confirmed. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=200.79999999999998s)]
*  I think this is also important, this new reporting, because it reminds people that [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=206.64s)]
*  there are things about this investigation that are still not public. But again, we reached out [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=211.2s)]
*  45 minutes ago to Gates's team to tell them that we were going to go public with this story. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=215.92s)]
*  We told them it would go public around 1230 and before he got a statement, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=221.04s)]
*  he announced that he is withdrawing from his attorney general nomination. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=225.2s)]
*  Wow, wow. We were waiting for that reporting Paula. We were on pins and needles here quietly, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=228.23999999999998s)]
*  in the studio waiting for you to come with that reporting. And this is certainly [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=234.72s)]
*  will be really funny when pardon Trump pardons him just in case. I don't think you can do a [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  preemptive pardon. Huge, huge news that Matt Gates, we had just been talking. So they're saying there [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=244.32000000000002s)]
*  is a 17 year old girl, 17 year old woman who this is, this is such an insane, like obviously this [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=249.68s)]
*  is edited and not just like his face. I mean, they, he did say that though he did say he [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=257.6s)]
*  actually tried to imply that Tucker Carlson was somehow also there while the crime was taking [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=264.08000000000004s)]
*  place. And it's such a funny interview that lives in my mind because Tucker Carlson, you can see it [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=271.92s)]
*  in his eyes. Tucker Carlson is like, Oh, don't, don't, don't say that I had anything to do with [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=278.32000000000005s)]
*  this. So is that the end of Matt Gates's political career? No, absolutely not. Dude, are you kidding [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=284.32s)]
*  me? The, the, the is a benefit. What are you talking about? Gates says you met her at a dinner [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=290.4s)]
*  and Tucker stops and says, I have no recollection of that. What's going on. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=298.24s)]
*  Special election for no reason. Law. Yup. Oh, this was also funny. I saw this for all my [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=301.92s)]
*  Republican colleagues in the house and Senate. If we are going to release ethics reports and [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=316.8s)]
*  rip apart our own that Trump has appointed, then put it all out there for the American people to see. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=323.76s)]
*  Okay. All the ethics reports and claims, including the one I filed, all your harassment and assault [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=331.52s)]
*  claims that were secretly settled, paying off victims with taxpayer money, the entire Jeffrey [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=339.03999999999996s)]
*  Epstein files, tapes, recordings, witness interviews, but not just those. There is more. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=346.0s)]
*  Epstein wasn't slash isn't the only asset. If we're going to dance, let's all dance in the sunlight. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=352.96s)]
*  I'll make sure we do. So this is the only time where I have ever found myself agreeing 100% with [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=360.72s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor green, which is shocking. I know, but in the interest of bipartisanship, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=368.88000000000005s)]
*  in the interest of bipartisanship and civility, I must say I agree with this Titan. Having said [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=374.96000000000004s)]
*  that, however, the implication here is also damning for Marjorie Titan green. Why is it damning for [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=381.04s)]
*  her because she's now admitting that like she knows of a litany of misconduct cases [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=388.32s)]
*  that her colleagues have engaged with. It's like, bitch, release it then. What do you mean [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=396.8s)]
*  by partisanship? You're a Republican. Yes. I don't understand why she just so voluntarily revealed [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=402.32s)]
*  that like, there's actually a lot rapist in Congress than you would think. This is the type [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=409.2s)]
*  of that I don't understand. It's like, if you have this kind of information and you, you know, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=415.04s)]
*  threaten to reveal it, but you don't actually reveal it, then I guess you just don't care. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=419.84000000000003s)]
*  Like what, what does this mean? It makes no sense. QAnon representative covering for pedophiles for [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=424.72s)]
*  political gain. Who could have imagined? Yeah. Saying this, by the way, in the interest of [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=430.96000000000004s)]
*  defending one other pedophiles, also nasty work. Speaking of speaking of nasty work, the Democrats [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=435.36s)]
*  are still running around doing Democrats. Kamala Harris tells Netanyahu that the U S opposed to the [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=442.88s)]
*  ICC probe of Israel. This is early U S vice president. Israeli leaders say in a say court [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=450.08s)]
*  in the Hague has no jurisdiction over the issue as prosecutor pledges impartial probe. This is from [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=457.2s)]
*  2021 chat. This is from, this is back when Ben Suda was trying to prosecute Israel. And then [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=461.28s)]
*  Donald Trump issued or not even Donald Trump, sorry. Donald Trump had issued sanctions on her [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=468.71999999999997s)]
*  and she was slated to be replaced. Yeah. Which is crazy. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=476.4s)]
*  Anyway, it don't really matter. Cause while I don't think Matt Gates is political career is over, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=482.0s)]
*  Kamala Harris is certainly over. If the democratic party elevates Kamala Harris to another thing, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=487.2s)]
*  to another position, I'm so done. I just, Oh God, they're going to do it. They're going to try to [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=493.03999999999996s)]
*  make her run for California governor or some or maybe make her run again. They're going to make [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=498.64000000000004s)]
*  Kamala Harris run again. They wanted to be the next California governor. Oh my God. Oh my God. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=502.72s)]
*  Morning Joe ratings continue to plummet. The ratings for morning Joe are weaker on Wednesday [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=508.56s)]
*  than on Tuesday in the six AM hour Wednesday, the show average 620. Oh my God. 620,000 viewers [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=513.52s)]
*  with 46,000 in the 25 to 54 demo to be fair. MSNBC ratings have been generally weak since Trump one, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=521.84s)]
*  but this is a notable AM drop off 46,000. That's crazy. Right now there's 37,000 people with [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=527.68s)]
*  within the actual prime, within the actual prime demo, which is 18 to 35, 25 to 54 is the new [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=537.76s)]
*  metric. Back when I was working in the ad world in the ad space, the actual target demo was 18 to 35 [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=544.9599999999999s)]
*  and it still is. But because cable news has gotten so old that they literally changed the [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=551.52s)]
*  metrics. And even then they're losing on those metrics, the, the 25 to 54 demo, and they're still [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=557.44s)]
*  getting cooked. Okay. Now, one thing for you to understand, like that's Nielsen, right? These are [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=564.6400000000001s)]
*  Nielsen television metrics, television ratings. This doesn't mean that there are 46,000 concurrent [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=571.44s)]
*  viewers in the 25 to 54 demo. This means over the hour that it's tracked, there were around four to [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=578.8000000000001s)]
*  5,000 in that demo. So right now I have 37,700 people watching live concurrent viewers. That [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=585.84s)]
*  means that I have around 300 to 400,000 or 300 to 250,000 people over the course of an hour. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=593.84s)]
*  That that is how that would translate to television ratings. It's like a, it's like a five to 10 X [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=602.8s)]
*  ratings for MSNBC's morning Joe have declined noticeably for two consecutive days after his [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=609.4399999999999s)]
*  host detailed a visit to Trump Wednesday's overall audience fell by 15%. It's viewership among people [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=613.36s)]
*  between 25 to 54 tumbled nearly 41%. Oh my God. They're so cooked. They're so fucking cooked. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=618.64s)]
*  Could be 20 X. If you moved your camera back to show Kaya, okay, shut up. What some of y'all need [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=626.24s)]
*  the touch grass. If you're so locked in the age three internet drama, I agree. Oh my God. These guys [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=631.28s)]
*  are just like the democratic party. They just keep pivoting to the right, hoping that the audience [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=637.04s)]
*  comes back, but no one comes back and they just only look at that and go, we should pivot to the [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=641.92s)]
*  right further. I find that really odd, especially when it's like television ratings are not like [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=646.56s)]
*  the democratic party. Okay. I understand why I understand why the democratic party operates that [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=652.4799999999999s)]
*  way because they're beholden to their corporate masters, but why the fuck, why the fuck would [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=658.24s)]
*  you do that? If you're a TV show and your job is to get more viewers, I know the media is beholden [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=664.3199999999999s)]
*  to their corporate masters as well, but the expectation here isn't for them to pivot and [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=670.96s)]
*  fucking start talking about Maoism dog. The expectation is that they like actually, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=676.24s)]
*  you know, Mount a reasonable defense against Donald Trump or continue being a part of the [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=682.1600000000001s)]
*  resistance liberalism. And it's quite interesting that they have not done that. And they're not [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=688.24s)]
*  doing that. And it's something that I called out pretty early on. If you remember, I said, I don't [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=693.44s)]
*  think we're going to see a resurgence of 2016 era liberal resistance. Okay. I think that both [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=698.96s)]

*  party, but, but more importantly than the democratic party, I think all of the liberal hashtag resistors [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=709.2s)]
*  are going to heal. They're going to, they're going to literally show their bellies and they are [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=714.5600000000001s)]
*  our Brianna. I'm surprised the spinal is where I'm like, you could even feel being crushed into [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=720.64s)]
*  the boots of those you supported Brianna. Who I probably gotten 400 to 500 messages from Trump [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=723.9200000000001s)]
*  voters telling me not to worry about my rights being rolled back that they don't care what adults [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=728.08s)]
*  like me do and his children they care about, but here we are. And Nancy Mase is trying to force [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=732.24s)]
*  people like me to use the men's room. And Trump isn't even an office. I transitioned over 20 years [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=736.48s)]

*  live our lives. She's so stupid. Like actually the dumbest person on the fucking planet. It's [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=749.44s)]
*  kind of crazy how stupid she is. Brianna Wu is trans. Yeah. I think she like openly revealed [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=754.8s)]
*  that she's trans recently. Yeah. I think a lot of the trans members of this community knew. And [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=759.8399999999999s)]
*  if you recall, I personally said, I don't know. And I don't care. Back when people used to ask [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=766.9599999999999s)]
*  me her Reddit account is just doing the, yeah, no, her, she is, she is a, she's a person who [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=772.0799999999999s)]
*  directly got her mind melted by destiny. So if you want, if you're wondering why she's like become [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=777.68s)]
*  even more stupid since October seven, it's because she's just like channels, everything that he says. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=783.04s)]
*  Anyway, I swear she's been out and about trans is the gamer gate days. No, back then she would, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=788.16s)]
*  I think back then she said stuff like what difference does it make if I'm trans or not, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=792.7199999999999s)]
*  but I don't really care. Like her being trans doesn't change the dynamic of her being stupid. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=797.76s)]
*  Okay. She's incredibly stupid. Make no mistake. I will defend trans rights, including Brianna [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=803.76s)]
*  Wu's trans rights, but I will never defend Brianna Wu. If that makes sense. Hassan is a joke. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=810.96s)]
*  Lol. I know Gates is going to be so lit. Why does this on support extremist terrorism? Hassan is a [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=817.52s)]
*  joke. Lol. Why does, why are there so many people who come in here and channel what like Ethan [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=823.12s)]
*  destiny and, and fucking Dan are saying, but then they also openly admitted their Republican. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=830.1600000000001s)]
*  Why are there so many Republicans of these fucking fandoms? I thought these guys were all liberals, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=836.64s)]
*  dude. What happened? Gates is going to be so lit is so funny. Yeah, dude. Yeah. Hopefully Gates [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=840.32s)]
*  will be lit on, on the special election that he has to go back to now because he voluntarily [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=846.4000000000001s)]
*  removed himself from his position in, in Congress so that he could become the attorney general [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=854.32s)]
*  only to voluntarily remove himself from that position. When everybody was like, no dude, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=860.8000000000001s)]
*  you can't do that. You're a fucking pedophile. It's so funny. This guy's like, yeah, Gates is [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=866.5600000000001s)]
*  going to be a turn. You know, it's like, no, you need to be caught up. The reason why we're talking [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=871.6800000000001s)]
*  about Gates to begin with, if you saw the title is because he withdrew. He fucking withdrew and [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=875.9200000000001s)]
*  he's already been replaced. Donald Trump replaced them already. You fucking idiot. Pam Bondi is the [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=883.36s)]
*  new attorney general. Pam was a prosecutor for nearly 20 years where she was very tough on [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=889.04s)]
*  violent criminals and made the streets of safer Florida families. Let's see what fucking, let's [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=894.0s)]
*  see what kind of sexual harassment and assaults that she's engaged in, you know? But Pam Bondi [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=899.12s)]
*  seems to be someone that he's plucked from Florida. We know he is a Florida man, but he's plucked [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=904.88s)]
*  because he's familiar with her and fully expects her to go from his super PAC now into the DOJ to [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=909.68s)]
*  do his bid and what should we know includes cleaning house over at DOJ for anyone who's been [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=916.4s)]
*  critical of him. Stay with me, Juanita. I want to bring back Jason Johnson. You may remember him [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=921.2s)]
*  from such news events as covering the DOJ 10 minutes ago. Welcome back, Jason. Thanks, Ari. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=926.72s)]
*  It's a big news night. I'm going to have you, I'm going to let you get in here, but I'll tell viewers [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=932.96s)]
*  because I always try to keep it as real and frank as possible. This is how this works. We did book [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=937.6s)]
*  these two guests for a different attorney general nominee story, but I don't think either of you [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=943.2800000000001s)]
*  knew that this was breaking. The timestamp on Donald Trump's statement tonight at 6 28 p.m. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=948.24s)]
*  Eastern naming Pam Bondi. I want to add a couple more details on that because it's a breaking story [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=953.6s)]
*  and then Jason bring you in here. There is a distinction that everyone should understand [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=957.84s)]
*  about this attorney general nominee versus Matt Gaetz. Many people, experts, nonpartisan officials, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=961.92s)]
*  as well as Republicans noted that Gaetz had essentially no experience as a prosecutor or [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=967.44s)]
*  in the kind of legal managerial work that anyone would do at any leadership level at DOJ, let alone [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=972.72s)]
*  the top post of attorney general United States. The contrast to Miss Bondi is she does have that [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=978.08s)]
*  kind of experience, much more traditional than what you would see in a top DOJ post because she [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=982.8000000000001s)]
*  was the top law enforcement official in the state of Florida and she has over 15 years experience [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=988.24s)]
*  in that role and other roles as a prosecutor. If you remember Kamala Harris running for president [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=993.5200000000001s)]
*  and talking about being a prosecutor at the state level, this is that kind of job. And so in that [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=997.44s)]
*  experience, it is much more of a traditional role, something that the Senate Judiciary Committee and [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1001.84s)]
*  others who vet these kind of nominees would see as a positive, as experience. The flip side, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1007.28s)]
*  which our guest Juanita just mentioned is unlike traditional attorneys general, this is an individual [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1012.72s)]
*  who's very tied politically to Donald Trump, the loyalty that he has talked about. And while there [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1017.52s)]
*  is nothing disqualifying about working on an impeachment defense, it positions her not as [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1023.28s)]
*  someone who was a nonpartisan state level prosecutor ready to rise up to the DOJ, but someone who's [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1028.16s)]
*  already been in those really searing partisan battles over Donald Trump's conduct in history. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1033.44s)]
*  And you want generally an attorney general who is not overly tied to past partisan positions, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1039.3600000000001s)]
*  even when they intersect, for example, with politics and law in Washington. So that's one [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1044.56s)]
*  update I wanted to give and bring you back in, Jason. I say that with all accuracy and fairness, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1048.96s)]
*  on paper, her state level experience is much closer to what presidents in both parties have [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1054.3200000000002s)]
*  sought at the DOJ. That's a huge difference with Matt Gaetz. The political part though is different. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1061.12s)]
*  And then what I bring to you is, and Juanita mentioned it, you have that political history [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1066.8s)]
*  and you have a proposed number two, a deputy attorney general who recently handled Donald Trump's [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1071.1999999999998s)]
*  criminal defense. So if this were the team, and they have to go through vetting and confirmation, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1076.56s)]
*  but if this were the team, this would be two of the most politically defensive lawyers of the [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1080.8799999999999s)]
*  personal capacity of an incoming president we've ever seen running DOJ at the same time. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1088.56s)]
*  All right. I completely agree. And quite frankly, my thought is that after Gaetz dropped out, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1093.2s)]
*  it would be essentially somebody from Trump's legal team. It would be like a J. Secular or [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1098.72s)]
*  somebody like that. I assume that's where he would get these people from. Unlike William Barr, even [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1102.24s)]
*  going back to when we were all kids and like Janet Reno, right? Occasionally attorney generals try to [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1106.56s)]
*  behave like they are not the personal lawyer of the president of the United States. That is [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1111.52s)]
*  completely out the window. Okay. I'm looking, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I don't care about this [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1116.0s)]
*  stuff. I'm just excited to see what kind of scandals come with Pam Bondi, Florida attorney [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1120.88s)]
*  general saw donation before nixing Trump university fraud case. Ooh, Ooh, Florida attorney general [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1126.56s)]
*  Pam Bondi is denying that a $25,000 donation from Donald Trump is in any way connected to our office [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1134.0s)]
*  decision not to pursue action against Trump university, despite dozens of complaints in [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1138.48s)]
*  Florida. Oh, by the way, this chat and this community is literally better than mainstream [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1142.32s)]
*  media for this reason. Okay. Because we have 37,700 little freaks in here right now. We find and [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1148.32s)]
*  scour the interweb faster than, you know, producers as CNN can, even though this is from their own [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1155.76s)]
*  archives. Okay. We're on it. We're already ahead of the game, baby. She's also a scientist. No, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1161.76s)]
*  you're fucking kidding. No way. Pam Bondi has ties to Scientology. Shut the fuck up. No way. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1167.52s)]
*  The Trump foundation, Pam Bondi scandal. This is from the same, I assume. Yeah. The 25 grand [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1178.16s)]
*  contribution pay for play. That's cool. Yeah. Remember the Ryan Rue story. We are sleuths. I [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1183.36s)]
*  know Tampa Bay times Pam Bondi is clear water fundraiser organized by Scientology's way. What [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1189.76s)]
*  Pam Bondi special guests, the invitation says will be us rep David Jolly. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1194.8s)]

*  good. The fact that it's on shit. Some bond is just more evidence that he's transphobic. Okay. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1219.2s)]
*  That's not a funny joke. New clip just dropped. How's that? I'd be helping cut her house. Hamas [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1222.72s)]
*  bondy. I don't think it's me on secret Trump tape. President Donald Trump's controversial [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1227.92s)]
*  contribution to Florida attorney. Jam, general Pam bondy's political committee. Five years ago, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1231.92s)]
*  it started to creep back into the sunshine. States politics in a September, 2016 recording [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1236.4s)]
*  made surreptitiously by president Trump's former lawyer. Oh my God. Is it Michael Cohen? Is it [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1240.08s)]
*  Michael Cohen that caught her? Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh baby. Don't lie to me. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1244.48s)]
*  If I tell you my story, don't cry. Friend of the show. Michael Cohen does it again. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1251.76s)]
*  In September, 2016 recording made surreptitious about president Trump's former lawyer of a [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1260.24s)]
*  conversation that may have concerned a secret payment to hush up an affair with former playboy [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1263.92s)]
*  model. Trump is initially heard talking on the phone about an unrelated matter to someone whose [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1268.08s)]
*  name sounds like Pam. Bonnie told Politico that she doesn't remember all of her calls from 2016, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1271.28s)]
*  but she believes she is not the one talking to Trump whose side of the phone conversation [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1275.36s)]
*  was the only one recorded when attorney Michael Cohen walked in the room. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1278.72s)]
*  Can you break it down for dumb nuts? This is Michael Cohen, friend of the show, host of the pod, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1302.16s)]
*  maya culpa. Michael Cohen is a convict. Okay. Former felon, Michael Cohen, like is Donald Trump's [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1309.28s)]
*  personal fixer, former lawyer who went to prison for doing hush money payments to porn star [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1318.6399999999999s)]
*  Stormy Daniels in the process, the court in the process where the court unearthed [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1325.92s)]
*  certain recordings that Michael Cohen had on his phone. It seems like Donald Trump was having a [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1332.0800000000002s)]
*  conversation with Pam Bondi, who is Donald Trump's new pick for attorney general. After the former [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1337.8400000000001s)]
*  attorney general, Matt Gates, which was his pick prior to this had to resign and disgrace from the [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1346.0800000000002s)]
*  position because he's a pedophile allegedly. That's right. It seems to me like Pam Bondi also [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1352.0s)]
*  did some paid to play schemes with Donald Trump, sought out donations from Donald Trump, and then [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1358.4s)]
*  threw aside the Donald Trump court case on Trump university from Florida. Now I'll just say it [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1364.8s)]
*  like this. I'm sure there's more stuff to come out because that right there is not that bad. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1370.56s)]
*  I mean, she's going to be a demon regardless. And it's obvious that Donald Trump chose her because [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1375.2s)]
*  you know, she's loyal. But yeah, so Matt Gates now has to go back to his own district and do a [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1380.0800000000002s)]
*  special election for no fucking reason. About the question of whether he would do this, given the [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1386.4s)]
*  fact that this was very much a pick that Donald Trump wanted. And I just want to read some of [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1392.64s)]
*  actually read all of Matt Gates's suite where he just announced that he was withdrawing. I had [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1399.8400000000001s)]
*  excellent meetings with senators yesterday. I appreciate their thoughtful feedback and the [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1404.3999999999999s)]
*  incredible support of so many. While the momentum was strong, it is clear that my confirmation was [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1409.6799999999998s)]
*  unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump bans transition. There is no [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1416.3999999999999s)]
*  time to waste on a needlessly protracted Washington scuffle. Thus, I'll be withdrawing my name from [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1422.8s)]
*  consideration to serve as attorney general. Trump's DOJ must be in place and ready on day one. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1429.6s)]
*  And he says that he remains fully committed to helping Donald J. Trump. I mean, wow, this is [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1435.52s)]
*  really, really big news. And we knew that this was, I wouldn't even say possibility. I would say [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1444.48s)]
*  probability given so much quiet opposition by Republicans. The fact that there was more [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1452.08s)]
*  information coming out. Paula Reed and our colleagues went to them with that information. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1460.6399999999999s)]
*  We were going to report it and he's out. He's out. This is going to be a huge relief to a lot [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1466.48s)]
*  of Senate Republicans who did not want to have this debate, who did not want to face the first [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1472.8799999999999s)]
*  sort of chance to show whether or not they were going to stand up to Donald Trump on something [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1477.6s)]
*  that they disagreed with or not. And it's a blow certainly to President-elect Trump for having [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1481.68s)]
*  seen his nominee not last, what, two weeks, but this will clear the way for Senate Republicans to [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1488.72s)]
*  have somebody at the top who they can support. Also, I would take issue with one thing he said [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1497.1200000000001s)]
*  in that tweet, which is- Just one thing? That it was a scuffle? [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1501.8400000000001s)]
*  One thing stood out to me is that he said the momentum was strong. I think the reporting [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1505.76s)]
*  shows very clearly that the momentum was not strong. Otherwise he would still be the [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1511.28s)]
*  nominee. Manu, I want to go to you on Capitol Hill. I know this just broke. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1516.24s)]
*  It's a little fucked up that Hassan Aboukian respects the decision of a guy who wants to step [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1521.12s)]
*  away from work to spend time more time with other people's kids. Free Nestor, free Nestor [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1524.3999999999999s)]
*  till it's spelled backwards. Okay. Free Nestor from the treacherous grips of Matt Gates. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1530.24s)]
*  Okay. The only time Nestor ever felt free was when Matt Gates was diddling other people's kids. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1536.8799999999999s)]
*  Okay. Free Nestor. But what are you hearing so far? I'm guessing the relief that Jeff Mason [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1541.9199999999998s)]
*  was just describing. Yeah, no question about it. I mean, there were a lot of Republican senators [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1549.04s)]
*  who were concerned about defying Donald Trump, but just really could not get themselves to [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1553.36s)]
*  supporting Matt Gates's nomination, not just because of the allegations in the house ethics [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1558.48s)]
*  committee report, some of which have been leaked to the press, but just about his style, the way [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1564.8s)]
*  he's battled with Republicans and Democrats alike. There are concerns about whether he can actually [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1568.96s)]
*  do this job. And there's just a real belief among many Republicans that I spoke to that [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1574.1599999999999s)]
*  even if they went through this process, they'd be expending so much political capital to get him [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1580.8s)]
*  across the finish line. And that may not have been, they still might not be enough to vote yes on this [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1585.44s)]
*  confirmation that ultimately would go down. That made it so complicated to see how he could ultimately [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1590.64s)]
*  get through. It is still going to catch a lot of people by surprise because Gates was on Capitol [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1596.3200000000002s)]
*  Hill all day yesterday, meeting with senators, trying to urge them to keep an open mind through [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1600.72s)]
*  this confirmation process. They successfully delayed that house ethics committee report. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1606.24s)]
*  It'll be an interesting decision now whether that house ethics committee report will could still see [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1611.0400000000002s)]
*  the light of day, even though Matt Gates has resigned from Congress. That committee is still [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1617.04s)]
*  planning to meet in early December to decide how to proceed. And one other thing, Dana, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1621.84s)]
*  Matt Gates resigned from his house seat in this Congress. He said in that letter to the house that [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1626.8799999999999s)]
*  he would not serve in the next Congress, although he was just reelected to that seat for the next [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1632.8799999999999s)]
*  Congress. Does he change his mind and decide to stay in his seat over the next two years? That's [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1638.72s)]
*  a question I just put out to Mr. Gates. We'll see how he responds to that question. But of course, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1644.32s)]
*  he does that could bring the ethics committee investigation back to light. So a huge development [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1650.0s)]
*  here and no question about it. A big sigh of relief for many Republicans who did not want to vote [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1655.04s)]
*  for Matt Gates. Yeah, no question. All right. Let us know if you can. She stole a dog from Katrina [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1659.9199999999998s)]
*  victims. Stop. Shut the fuck up. RNC speaker Pam Bondi was once in a 60 month custody battle over [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1665.36s)]
*  a dog with a hurricane Katrina victim. Oh my God. Stop. Stop. This makes no sense. Okay. I can't [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1671.76s)]
*  believe I'm saying this, but I guess Donald Trump, I guess Donald Trump is, is, is doing the damn [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1680.24s)]
*  thing where, you know, at least she's not a pedophile. Like I don't get it. Like at least [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1686.24s)]
*  she didn't shoot the dog. Like Christie gnome. Get more reaction. Manu, I want to go to West Palm [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1691.76s)]
*  Beach. Kristen Holmes is there at her post reporting on the Trump transition. Kristen, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1697.68s)]
*  what are you hearing? Yeah. No official word yet from president-elect Donald Trump or his team, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1703.52s)]
*  but I can tell you, Dan, I spoke to a number of people this morning who were talking about just [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1707.76s)]
*  how far they were going to have to go to try and get Gates confirmed. How much political capital [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1711.68s)]
*  was Donald Trump going to use? And there was concern among the, among those close to the [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1717.04s)]
*  former president, now president elect that they could not get a number of other cabinet picks [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1722.16s)]
*  through if he used all of his political capital on Matt Gates, which was seeming like it might be [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1727.2s)]
*  the outcome of all of this. Now, of course there were questions as to whether or not Donald Trump [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1733.04s)]
*  would react or change the direction that he was going in once that ethics report came out, if it [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1737.28s)]
*  did in fact come out. But we have been told that Donald Trump was all in on Matt Gates, that he [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1742.16s)]
*  had said over and over again, that he was going to give him his support. It was the most important [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1747.8400000000001s)]
*  pick, but for those around Donald Trump and the people who wanted to get some of these other [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1752.56s)]
*  not as controversial, but still slightly controversial picks across the finish line, [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1757.1999999999998s)]
*  they were worried about then being a larger holdup because of the fact that he was expending so much [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1761.76s)]
*  political capital on Matt Gates. Now, I will tell you, I did talk to a number of sources close to [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1766.8s)]
*  Gates after those meetings with those Republican senators who said they were cautiously optimistic [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1772.0s)]
*  about how it went. However, when you look at what some of those senators said afterwards in terms of [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1777.6s)]
*  transparency, in terms of essentially warning Gates that there could be more stuff, that he needed [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1783.04s)]
*  to be transparent coming forward, it was unclear if their reaction to this, again, cautiously [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1788.3999999999999s)]
*  optimistic, was the same reaction that Gates himself or those senators were having after they [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1793.52s)]
*  actually sat down with Gates. But one thing that is just so interesting about all of this is the [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1799.28s)]
*  fact that Donald Trump had been hammering down behind closed doors that this was the most important [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1805.12s)]
*  pick to him, that he believed that this was something he had to stand by. He wanted Matt [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1810.96s)]
*  Gates to be the quote unquote effective communicator. Now, obviously, we'll see, we're back to the [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1815.52s)]
*  drawing board on attorney general. We know that when it came to Matt Gates, he wasn't even on the [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1820.64s)]
*  original shortlist. It was decided on a plane ride from West Palm Beach or Palm Beach to DC and back [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1825.8400000000001s)]
*  and that's when that announcement came. So we are going to have to play this out now, but now there [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1833.28s)]
*  are more critical positions, including secretary of treasury that have yet to be filled. It is [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1837.28s)]
*  going to be clear this is going to be something they're going to turn their full attention to [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1843.04s)]
*  because remember, Dana, overall, this is their this is their number one thing. This is what [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1846.56s)]
*  Donald Trump believes the most important cabinet position is. Now to the question of leadership [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1851.12s)]
*  and sexual misconduct. It doesn't stop. It's just like, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1855.6s)]
*  Yo voy a votar por Donald Trump. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1867.44s)]
*  Ay, ay, ay, ay, por dios. Yo voy a votar por Donald Trump. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1871.44s)]
*  It's fucking crazy. Economía por Trump. Trumpito. Okay, you can't, you can't have [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1878.56s)]
*  this many rapists, man. What the hell is going on, man? Does every cabinet appointee have to be a [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1886.72s)]
*  rapist? Oops, all rapists. What the fuck? Allegations against two of the president elect's [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1893.84s)]
*  cabinet picks. CBS News has learned have been- It's just like, at this point is like what severity [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1900.48s)]
*  is the sexual assault crime that you have engaged with? You know what I mean? Depending on the [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1907.36s)]
*  severity is a requirement for sure. Like they won't let you, you at the very least have to be [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1912.32s)]
*  like Linda McMahon, Vince McMahon's wife, who hired a pedophile. Okay. Knowing that he was a [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1917.44s)]
*  pedophile and then was like, hey, as long as you don't diddle kids any further, like you're good. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1924.88s)]
*  And then he still kept diddling kids. RFK Jr. sexually assaulted his babysitter. RFK Jr. was [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1930.3200000000002s)]
*  also so, so much of a serial adulterer that his fucking first wife committed suicide after [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1936.88s)]
*  she read his diary. Okay. It's kind of crazy. So I don't know. I mean, Pam Bondi, not looking too [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1943.44s)]
*  good. You know, I just, I'm going to, I'm going to wait. I'm going to sit back and wait till we find [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1950.56s)]
*  out more about Pam Bondi's background. No records related to claims that attorney general pick. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1954.8s)]
*  That's Matt Gaetz paid for sex. We've also now seen a police report from a sexual assault [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1960.48s)]
*  allegation against defense secretary pick Pete Hexeth. Scott McFarland is tracking all of this [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1965.68s)]
*  on Capitol Hill. Scott, good morning to you. Gail, good morning. This 22 page police report [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1971.52s)]
*  provides new details about the allegations against Pete Hexeth, president elect Trump's choice to be [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1977.52s)]
*  the next defense secretary. And it comes down as Hexeth arrives here today to meet with the Republican [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1983.2s)]
*  senators. We'll decide. The fuck is this? Yes. This Pam Bondi, no relation to Joseph A Bondi. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1989.44s)]
*  Hashtag let Lev speak. Hashtag Lev remembers. Hashtag they all knew. What is this? I don't [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=1995.2s)]
*  understand. What am I supposed to get from this? That's Lev Parnas. What? I don't know what that [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2000.56s)]
*  is, man. I don't, I'm sorry. That's you're in too deep. You're in too deep. You're in too deep. I [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2005.36s)]
*  don't, I don't know what the fuck that means, but I'm not. It's like when you guys send me like a [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2010.1599999999999s)]
*  deep fried meme and I need to know eight different things before I understand what the fuck's going [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2014.32s)]
*  on. That's what it feels like. I only know Lev Parnas is a name that I have avoided like the [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2018.8799999999999s)]
*  fucking plague. I feel like is, is Russia gate related. I'm good. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2023.6s)]
*  Died whether or not to confirm him overnight. The police report was released detailing a 2017 [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2028.72s)]
*  sexual assault allegation against Fox host Pete Hexeth. The accuser referenced as Jane Doe reported [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2034.24s)]

*  crime. The Trump transition team continues to publicly support Hexeth as a nominate. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2063.92s)]
*  That's actually fucking nuts because like the cops literally just let him go because they're also [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2069.6800000000003s)]

*  The gates is alleged to have attended 10 to 15 sex parties and had sex with a 17 year old minor [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2131.36s)]

*  investigators show Gates paid two women up to $10,000 over 27 payments. Gates has denied any [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2143.44s)]
*  wrongdoing. Democrats have said senators who'll decide whether to confirm Gates as the next [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2151.0400000000004s)]

*  representatives. So this report would not be made public. Let's get to the bottom line here. He does [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2160.64s)]
*  not want it to be made public and there must be something in there. Republicans have argued the [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2165.3599999999997s)]
*  Senate's background review of Gates will find whatever details the senators need to know to [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2169.12s)]
*  cast their votes. You think it'll all come out anyhow about Mr. Gates? Yeah, it'll be a full [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2173.6s)]
*  review. Again, for all of the nominees, we're going to follow the process. This house ethics [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2179.12s)]
*  panel deadlock might be difficult to break. There are five members from each party on the panel and [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2184.3199999999997s)]
*  a majority vote is needed. Tony, we'll keep following it. Scott, thank you very much. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2189.6s)]
*  Elena, you cover the Trump transition for us. So I'm just going to start here when it comes to Pete [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2195.2799999999997s)]
*  Hexeth. Once again, in the in light of this police report, we are hearing from the Trump team saying [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2200.96s)]
*  that he fully supports his nominee. There's no plan to even close to withdraw him. This report [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2209.6s)]
*  corroborates what Mr. Hexeth's attorneys have said all along. The incident was fully investigated [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2216.0s)]
*  and no charges were filed. Now she says because police found the allegations to be false. I just [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2221.28s)]
*  want to underscore, we don't know that police found the allegations to be false. What we know is that [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2226.88s)]
*  he wasn't prosecuted. What happened in between the allegations and the- By the way, the police [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2233.68s)]
*  report is out on the Pete Hexeth sexual assault claim. Okay. Instant report says rape victim [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2240.16s)]
*  unconscious of the nature of the act. Rape. Like it's not like they just straight up. I mean, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2246.8799999999997s)]
*  it's pretty straightforward. None of the none of them being prosecuted. We don't know. He said [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2252.3999999999996s)]
*  just now when he talked- It has happened with half of his other nominees too, like Kavanaugh, for [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2258.72s)]
*  example. I might be misremembering, but I mean, yeah, Kavanaugh too for sure, but not to this [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2263.04s)]
*  degree of like open and shut. Does that make sense? Like there wasn't, I don't think there was a, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2270.32s)]
*  a police report. Key points from the police report of Hexeth's alleged sexual assault. It was first [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2275.52s)]
*  reported by a nurse, not the accuser. Accusers suggest that she might've been drugged. Two other [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2280.32s)]
*  women at the events at Hexeth placed a hand on their thighs and invited them up to his hotel room. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2285.04s)]
*  Oh my God. An emergency room nurse contacted the police in 2017 after treating a woman who said that [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2289.84s)]
*  while drinking with colleagues after a political gathering several nights earlier, she may have [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2295.92s)]
*  been drugged and was was then sexually assaulted by a man. She later identified as Pete Hexeth. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2299.52s)]
*  According to records released Wednesday by the Monterey police department, a lawyer for Hexeth, [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2303.52s)]
*  president-elect Donald Trump's nominee to be defense sector, he said the encounter was [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2308.48s)]
*  consensual. Authorities declined to bring charges of the case. Hexeth later paid the woman an [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2311.6800000000003s)]
*  undisclosed sum as a part of a non-disclosure agreement. Days later, the accuser told the [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2315.6s)]
*  nurse she suspected something may have been slipped into her drink that October, 2017 night. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2319.7599999999998s)]
*  According to police report, the records do not indicate whether investigators asked her about [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2324.4s)]
*  her suspicion that she may have been drugged. Hexeth told officers that throughout the encounter, [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2328.88s)]
*  he repeatedly checked to ensure the woman was on, was comfortable. He expressed that he did not want [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2332.88s)]
*  her to get in trouble. According to the report, Hexeth said she, so she showed early signs of regret. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2337.44s)]
*  The officer wrote, but did not elaborate police interviewed two other women at the conference who [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2341.84s)]
*  said the Hexeth had placed their hand on their thighs and invited them up to his hotel room. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2345.6800000000003s)]
*  One told officers that she'd asked dough to help ward him off. According to the report, dude, [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2349.28s)]
*  this guy is like a, this guy's a monster, dude. He's a fucking freak. I mean, like Christian [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2354.32s)]
*  nationalist, straightforward predator. Hexeth wrote that in a present newspaper about how he [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2360.4s)]
*  didn't believe women can be raped if they were unconscious because rape requires for there to be [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2365.36s)]
*  distress and an unconscious woman doesn't experience distress. No fucking shot. What? [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2368.32s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, he's also had like multiple affairs. He literally had a wife cheated on his wife, [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2373.36s)]
*  married the woman he cheated on his wife with, and then cheated on her with another woman that [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2378.4s)]
*  he ended up marrying as well. Yeah. He has a total of seven children from three different women, [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2383.04s)]
*  conservative values. Oh, speaking of which Biden, the corpse has come out. I made a statement. The [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2388.96s)]
*  ICC issuance of arrest warrants against Israeli leaders is outrageous. Let me be clear. Once again, [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2394.72s)]
*  whatever the ICC might imply, there is no equivalence known between Israel and Hamas. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2398.3199999999997s)]
*  Holy shit. They cover the article on the majority report this morning is true. It's more about the [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2402.0s)]
*  fact that an unconscious woman cannot be under duress. Therefore it cannot be rape. What the fuck? [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2406.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. He, he doesn't think women should be in combat roles. He paid a woman who accused him of [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2412.48s)]
*  rape to sign an NDA. We know that already. Post a column in college. They claim to have sex. Having [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2426.32s)]
*  sex with an unconscious woman is not rape. Hex it was a publisher of Princeton Tory, a right-wing [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2431.12s)]

*  unconscious woman was not rape. The columnist claimed that rape required both the failure to [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2444.96s)]
*  consent and duress and women who were passed out could not experience duress. A bemusing yet [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2448.08s)]
*  mandatory orientation program revolved entirely around whether an instance of sexual intercourse [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2452.96s)]
*  constituted rape. The actual instance portrayed in this case was in fact not a clear case of rape, [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2457.7599999999998s)]
*  at least not in my home state home state in short, though intercourse was not consented to, [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2462.32s)]
*  there was no duress because the girl drank herself in unconsciousness. Both criteria must [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2466.8s)]
*  be satisfied for rape. Unfortunately, the panel has never cited any legal definition of rape, [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2470.7200000000003s)]
*  yet the panel all females in the session I attended claim rape. It was what the fuck? Yeah. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2474.96s)]

*  Princeton Tory would help shape the way you view the world. So he didn't write this column. It's [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arEaaSpoJFg&t=2510.32s)]
