**HasanAbi:** [March 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8)
*  you know, that happened in 1948, kind of continuing basically [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=0.0s)]
*  until today, but in different forms and different, either [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  using different terms, different law, but in the end of the day, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=8.52s)]
*  it's about stealing our land as Palestinians and give it to [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=11.4s)]
*  those settlers and building more and more settlements and outposts [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=16.0s)]
*  and all the time talking about annexations, not annexation. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=19.92s)]
*  All right. All right. Ladies and gentlemen, we have some very [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=30.0s)]
*  special guests here today. Here. I'll play the trailer first [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=36.36s)]
*  and foremost for no other land. Okay. For those of you who [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=41.68s)]
*  haven't seen it yet, no other land is a no other land is a [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=45.32s)]
*  documentary here. Let's just, let's just start off with this [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=49.6s)]
*  real quick. This was the Berlin air trailer and then we'll [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=52.44s)]
*  Now, the Palestinians face one of the single biggest expulsion [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=60.52s)]
*  decisions since the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=65.88s)]
*  territories began. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=68.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=120.0s)]
*  This is what's happening in my village now. Soldiers are [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=136.52s)]
*  everywhere. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=139.72s)]
*  I'm [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=151.0s)]
*  Documentaries called no other land. We are joined by Hamdan [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=166.0s)]

*  for best documentary at the Oscars tomorrow. Thank you guys [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=173.76s)]
*  for taking some time out to come and join us on the broadcast. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=176.56s)]
*  I've had a motor's eyes in the past before as well. When did you [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=181.12s)]
*  guys get in? Thank you for having us. We arrived in LA [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=186.16s)]
*  yesterday. Okay. How do you like it so far? It looks beautiful. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=190.96s)]
*  We like it. That's it. Okay. Beautiful is not something I've [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=196.76s)]
*  ever heard people say about Los Angeles. So that's cool. You're [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=199.72s)]
*  going to have to get close to the microphone as well, by the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=203.16s)]
*  way. Just so you know, it's a complicated process, but do they [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=205.4s)]
*  want to hear something? No, it's Ramadan chatters. They're you [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=211.8s)]
*  they're fasting. I I'm a bad Muslim. So they, sorry. So they [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=215.08s)]
*  think, you know, they, they want, they want me to be polite [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=221.16s)]
*  and give you guys, wait, is there buzzing on one of the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=224.28s)]
*  microphones? No, there isn't. It doesn't. There's a buzzer high [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=229.0s)]
*  pitch when the orange microphone is used. Wait, really? Can you [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=232.28s)]
*  speak into it? Hello? Hi. It's fine. No, I hear it. Okay. Well, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=236.28s)]
*  regardless. All right. Well, I don't know how to fix it. So [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=244.04s)]
*  it's that, but it's really bad. It's a small buzz. Okay. I don't [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=247.0s)]
*  know. I don't know how to fix it in real time. Sorry. So it [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=252.28s)]
*  might, it might be a little bit. It's fine. Okay. Regardless, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=255.64s)]
*  there's an entire, there's 30,000 people watching right [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=260.76s)]
*  now. So they're going to be very annoying. I'm just letting you [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=264.28s)]
*  guys know. But yeah, like I said, thank you so much for [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=267.32s)]
*  coming. And so let's talk about how this initially started. Like [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=270.03999999999996s)]
*  what led you to, to film some of this, some of these [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=277.56s)]
*  experiences as, as a growing up in, in occupied Palestinian [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=281.24s)]
*  territory in the West Bank? Yeah. So we both coming from a [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=286.68s)]
*  small community called the Mesafer Yatta in the southern [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=291.16s)]
*  occupied West Bank. It's for those who don't know area C, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=294.36s)]
*  which is fully controlled by the Israeli military forces. They [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=299.48s)]
*  controls everything about our life. And there they are all [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=304.52s)]
*  the time trying, not trying, but actually stealing our land to [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=308.68s)]
*  build more and more of illegal settlements and outposts, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=313.88s)]
*  bringing in Jewish settlers from all over the world to live [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=317.71999999999997s)]
*  in it. While they are, since decades and still [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=321.32s)]
*  persist, destroy, trying to destroy and destroying a big [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=326.76s)]
*  part of our homes and communities in order to force us [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=330.52s)]
*  leave our homeland. So we basically grew up in this [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=334.52s)]
*  horrific situation where every day we have to suffer from the [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=339.48s)]
*  occupation and every day we have to witness something from [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=343.32s)]
*  this brutal occupation, reminding us that we are living [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=346.59999999999997s)]
*  an abnormal life and we are under this situation that nobody [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=349.24s)]
*  in the world like stopping it from going on. So when we [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=356.2s)]
*  became teenagers, we started to hold cameras in our hands and [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=361.88s)]
*  run in the field in our homes, our villages, with our [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=366.2s)]
*  neighbors, with the shepherds, with the school students, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=371.0s)]
*  filming what these crimes going on on the ground from settlers [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=374.36s)]
*  and from soldiers. And basically it began, we didn't have [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=379.48s)]
*  idea of making a movie. We just like wanted the people to know [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=383.56s)]
*  that we exist in this part of land. We want people to see [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=387.24s)]
*  what's actually happening to our life because every time there [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=390.36s)]
*  is bulldozers entering our community, destroying homes and [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=394.04s)]
*  properties and leave, you know, it's not even interested for [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=398.2s)]
*  journalists or the people. It's became a routine of our life. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=404.36s)]
*  While for us, it's not a routine. It's a new suffering. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=407.71999999999997s)]
*  There's a new family who losing their home and their structure, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=410.12s)]
*  their shelters. And all of the time we have been looking for [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=414.03999999999996s)]
*  different ways how we can make this footage and this evidence [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=417.24s)]
*  that we are taking on the ground seen by the world. And we [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=422.68s)]
*  wanted people to care about us, about what's happening. So we [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=427.32s)]
*  use sometimes social media. We have written articles about [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=431.72s)]
*  what's happening. And five years ago, we have been joined by [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=436.84000000000003s)]
*  other two Israeli journalists activists who came to Masaf [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=440.04s)]
*  Riyadh for the first time, wanted to write also about [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=444.04s)]
*  what's going on. And it became interested for them and they [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=448.04s)]
*  want to come more and more. And in the few times, the first few [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=452.44s)]
*  times we met Hamdan, who actually was the first one who [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=455.8s)]
*  mentioned the idea. Guys, what do you think of making a [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=460.28000000000003s)]
*  documentary out of all the footage that we have? None of us [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=465.96000000000004s)]
*  experienced doing a long documentary, but we decided, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=470.28000000000003s)]
*  four of us, and agreed to take experience journey together. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=474.68s)]
*  So five years ago, a lot of challenges, sometimes fun, a lot [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=481.0s)]
*  of troubles facing physical violence and threats and [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=487.48s)]
*  pressure for our work. And last February, for the first time, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=493.32s)]
*  we have been here. Wait, it's cutting out a little bit. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=501.08s)]
*  Yeah, you got to get really close to the microphone. Sorry. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=505.72s)]
*  Yes, fine. And the rally was the first step and first time we [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=508.68s)]
*  premiered No Other Land and have been one year and now we are [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=514.76s)]
*  in LA nominated for the Oscar as a best. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=519.4s)]
*  Yeah. Wait, let me also. Let's see. I'm trying to plug it in [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=523.08s)]
*  and unplug it and then replug it. Maybe it'll fix it. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=529.16s)]
*  Sometimes I think we can do this. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=533.32s)]
*  Sometimes. Okay. We can do that too. Hold on here. Try it again. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=535.7199999999999s)]
*  Hey, can you guys hear them? Is it better or does the green one, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=539.56s)]
*  the green one works? No, it's not better. It's fixed. Okay. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=544.8399999999999s)]
*  The green one sounds good. All right. You know what? Let's just [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=551.0s)]
*  do that. Let's just use one mic. Oh, okay. Sorry. This is not a, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=553.0799999999999s)]
*  this is a, not the most professional setup. If I'm being [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=559.9599999999999s)]
*  real, unfortunately, hold on. I think that's the second one. So [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=564.68s)]
*  test it by speaking to it. Hi. Hello. Okay. Yeah, it should be. All [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=569.88s)]
*  right. We're good. We're good. All right. We're not going to use [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=575.0s)]
*  the second microphone. Okay. So a couple of questions. So Americans [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=578.52s)]
*  are not very knowledgeable about what's going on in, in, in Gaza, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=585.3199999999999s)]
*  let alone the West bank. They don't even know that these are both [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=591.8s)]
*  Palestinian territories that are occupied by Israel as a belligerent [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=596.4399999999999s)]
*  occupier. So do you want to explain to them what the differences are [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=600.92s)]
*  between Gaza and the West bank? Yeah. Well, the differences between Gaza [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=609.4799999999999s)]
*  and the West bank is really like as occupied Gaza West bank, East [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=614.3599999999999s)]
*  Jerusalem and part of Jordan, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon in 1967. And then [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=619.32s)]
*  there was sort of agreements with Jordan, Egypt, where they returned [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=625.96s)]
*  their land back and Israel still occupying part of Lebanon land and [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=630.6s)]
*  Syrian land, and also in Palestine, Gaza, East Jerusalem and the West [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=636.6s)]
*  bank. And in the beginning of the 80s, or like in the middle of the 70s, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=641.88s)]
*  to the beginning of the 80s, they started building settlements and [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=646.92s)]
*  bringing first it was like military occupation. And then they started [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=650.5999999999999s)]
*  building settlements and bring in Jewish settlers, civilians to live in [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=656.52s)]
*  those settlements after they like steal land from from the Palestinians. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=660.68s)]
*  And it continued in this way, you know, with a lot with a lot of sufferings, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=666.12s)]
*  for sure, because we live under a foreign military control that try to [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=671.7199999999999s)]
*  as much as they can to push us out of out of our land, as we call it, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=677.0799999999999s)]
*  as Palestinians ongoing in Aqba because the Aqba continue but with different [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=683.56s)]
*  methods, you know, the catastrophe happened in 1948, kind of continuing [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=688.68s)]
*  basically until today, but in different forms in different either using [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=694.28s)]
*  different terms, different law, but in the end of the day, it's about [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=697.88s)]
*  stealing our land as Palestinians and give it to those settlers and [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=701.24s)]
*  building more and more Israeli settlements and outposts and all the [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=705.88s)]
*  time talking about annexations, not annexations when Trump was a [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=709.32s)]
*  president in the last term, he, for example, give Israel or like, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=713.88s)]
*  announce that Hyatt Golan, it's Israeli land and also make East Jerusalem [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=720.92s)]
*  as the capital of Israel. And this is how Israel is creating facts on the [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=727.48s)]
*  ground until the international community will be forced or America [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=733.56s)]
*  will help them and would be forced to accept that this has became Israel. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=736.5999999999999s)]
*  So all the talk about two state solution today kind of did because [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=740.8399999999999s)]
*  there is like Israel changed all the facts on the ground. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=745.0799999999999s)]
*  They divided Gaza from the West Bank. We can't go to Gaza. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=749.0s)]
*  People from Gaza can't come to the West Bank. It's totally divided. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=754.1999999999999s)]
*  Israel is controlled all the borders around the West Bank and around Gaza. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=758.8399999999999s)]
*  None of the Palestinians can go out and enter without permission of the army. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=763.08s)]
*  In 2005, Israel withdrew from Gaza and took the settlers that were living [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=768.6800000000001s)]
*  there but kept Gaza under control. All the borders were controlled. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=773.4000000000001s)]
*  People in Gaza were under besieged for 17 years, but they continued in the [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=778.84s)]
*  West Bank to until today, like building more and more settlements and [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=784.5200000000001s)]
*  checkpoints and roads, military bases. And basically this, like one of the [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=790.36s)]
*  reasons is to prevent us as Palestinians to have our own independence. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=797.0s)]
*  And my analysis on it is that Israel kept purposefully utilizing a two state [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=803.16s)]
*  solution that they were not really interested in, in the so-called peace process, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=811.8000000000001s)]
*  in an effort to continue pushing it down the line further and further. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=816.68s)]
*  And in some instances, like Netanyahu, for example, was very forthcoming, very honest [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=822.12s)]
*  about it too. He would say it's never going to happen or that we're not interested or I'm [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=827.2399999999999s)]
*  going to push it back. While simultaneously the number of settlers in the West Bank grew to now [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=831.3199999999999s)]
*  750,000 over the course of the past three decades. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=839.72s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, there was also agreement that where the Palestinian liberation movement has [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=844.12s)]
*  signed it and decided to become a Palestinian authority. That's because America played a rule [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=853.16s)]
*  and a key to have agreement and to create two state solution. And that's what the PLO agreed to [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=858.12s)]
*  and signed in and became a Palestinian authority and recognized Israel as a state. While Israel did [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=865.96s)]
*  totally the opposite. And like totally opposite, I mean, did not recognize by the same state and [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=873.24s)]
*  kept the occupation and kept building more and more settlements and outposts and escalated the [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=879.4000000000001s)]
*  situation until today. And the thing that why Israel was able to do this, because the US were [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=884.6800000000001s)]
*  the key player on this and make the Palestinian authority or the PLO sign such an agreement that [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=893.72s)]
*  they will guarantee it and they will prevent Israel from continuing the occupation and building [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=899.48s)]
*  settlements and outposts. And what happened all the past 30 years, totally the opposite. Where Israel [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=904.36s)]
*  were allowed and supported and funded and got military support as much as they want to continue [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=909.72s)]
*  the building of settlements and outposts and put Gaza under siege and checkpoints in the West Bank [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=917.48s)]
*  and all the crimes that have been committed. And they have no one single consequences. And [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=923.4s)]
*  America, Europe that allowed this to reach until today. Because Israel were only receiving some [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=930.6s)]
*  condemnations on social media, statements here and there, but no action on the ground to stop [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=938.6s)]
*  Israel from moving forward of like with its apartheid system to kill the two-state solution. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=944.12s)]
*  And at the end of the last year, there was a law that passed in the Israeli Parliament, where they [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=952.6s)]
*  directly and clearly and fully say there will never be a Palestinian state. And the world is silent. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=961.64s)]
*  Yeah. Do you, do you feel like things have changed post October 7 in terms of [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=970.6800000000001s)]
*  a lot more recognition coming from the Western world in terms of like understanding [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=979.96s)]
*  the, the position of Palestinians, because at least like I'm Turkish, I grew up in, in Turkey. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=987.64s)]
*  I've always, you know, it's, it's a little bit different from my upbringing. So, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=994.28s)]
*  cause I always knew what was going on, but over the past 10 years, as a political commentator, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1001.48s)]
*  I have always been a pro Palestinian emancipation pro Palestine, but I never [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1010.6s)]
*  saw this level of support from everyday citizens in the Western world. This is, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1018.52s)]
*  it does seem like there is a somewhat of a tide shift in that regard. Do you also, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1026.44s)]
*  do you also feel that way or? We definitely feel it. And we see it, the Palestinians were like [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1033.56s)]
*  seeing all the students who are protesting and feel that there are people who cares about them, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1039.56s)]
*  the protest in the street and the campus and Europe as well in the street, the people, there was [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1043.8s)]
*  a wave of support and it's continued, I guess, until today in some of, some of the countries, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1051.8799999999999s)]
*  there was even European countries who were brave enough, who was brave enough, like Spain [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1057.32s)]
*  and the wish and different other countries that recognize the state of Palestine. But we ask [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1062.84s)]
*  ourselves as well, that does this support that we are gaining today in the public opinion [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1071.4s)]
*  worth the price that the Palestinians paid in Gaza? This is an important question to ask ourselves. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1079.64s)]
*  Yeah. Like paid very, very high price, talking about tens of thousands of people who were like [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1088.1200000000001s)]
*  slaughtered and almost 70% to 80% of Gaza is flattened and there is like a chance that [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1095.8s)]
*  the war will start again and I wish not. So you say yes, like in public opinion, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1105.56s)]
*  as part of the Palestinians, but unfortunately in the government, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1111.96s)]
*  they keep the same support to Israel and using the vehicle here in the US, giving weapons and money [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1115.8799999999999s)]
*  and, you know, the major European government. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1122.6s)]
*  Hold on. I'm going to, I'm going to just change your noise gate real quick so that they can hear [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1127.6399999999999s)]
*  you because it keeps cutting out. Once I get chatters are they're congratulating you for your [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1132.4399999999998s)]
*  award on the, on the documentary or the nomination for the documentary as well. One second. Okay. It [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1137.8799999999999s)]
*  should be fine now going forward there. They'll just hear everything that you say won't cut out [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1145.08s)]
*  and hopefully people won't get annoyed. Okay. So today we're also raising money [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1150.12s)]
*  for the no other land rebuilding Alliance fundraiser. Do you want to talk about that [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1156.9199999999998s)]
*  a little bit as well? Hi, everyone. My name is Adam Ramadan. I'm the deputy director for [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1161.08s)]
*  rebuilding Alliance. I guess some background on rebuilding Alliance. We've been working [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1167.8799999999999s)]
*  in Palestine and Gaza and the West bank for, for over 20 years now. The founder and executive [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1175.32s)]
*  director, Donna Baranski Walker started rebuilding Alliance to rebuild the house that Rachel Corey [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1182.28s)]
*  was murdered protecting the Nasrallah's house in Gaza. And she was actually successful in [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1190.04s)]
*  rebuilding their house in Gaza. Unfortunately, that house has been demolished this past war [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1195.8s)]
*  since October 7th. So, you know, that's just more reason for us to continue our efforts and do what [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1201.8s)]
*  we're doing best. Let's talk more about the work we do in Gaza. We have over 20 kitchens. We're [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1207.48s)]
*  feeding over 70,000 people a day. That was in partnership with the world food program. Unfortunately, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1214.76s)]
*  that contract is coming to an end. So we have to take, you know, all the financial responsibility [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1220.52s)]
*  to ensure that these kitchens are, are still running. So that's one of the reasons why we [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1226.04s)]
*  started this fundraiser. We also do, you know, we have different educational programs. We have [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1230.76s)]
*  pop-up temporary, like as they call them in Gaza, temporary learning spaces since there are no schools. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1238.84s)]
*  We do hire teachers that worked as teachers to help, you know, put together any kind of program [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1246.44s)]
*  to ease the situation of the children in Gaza at this moment. We also, we've had partners prior [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1252.36s)]
*  to October 7th that's been running, you know, community kitchens and running programs to support [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1258.68s)]
*  social health like that. So, and also in the West Bank, the work that we do in the West Bank, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1265.64s)]
*  specifically in the Hebron Hills, we have social workers there that do activities for young children [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1270.76s)]
*  that are traumatized from the experiences they've, you know, had with the IDF and the Israeli soldiers. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1276.76s)]
*  We also, one of the biggest aspects of our work is we do congressional trips to the West Bank. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1289.64s)]
*  So we actually take members of Congress to Palestine and, you know, we let them go through [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1297.5600000000002s)]
*  the experience of, you know, what a Palestinian would go through every single day. So that's just [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1304.3600000000001s)]
*  a quick, you know, overview of the work that we do. We're excited to help, you know, Basel and Hamdan [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1309.72s)]
*  and their family with the visa to come here to the States to hopefully, you know, celebrate their [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1316.84s)]
*  victory and winning the Oscars tomorrow. Hopefully. Can you elaborate on that, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1324.12s)]
*  on the difficulties of such a thing? Because I think a lot of people don't understand, like, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1332.1999999999998s)]
*  it's not very easy for Palestinians from the West Bank to be able to travel freely. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1336.9199999999998s)]
*  And as far as I understand, there's also issues with even returning once you leave the West Bank. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1343.96s)]
*  Israel has so much control over this territory that it legally occupies that there have been [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1351.72s)]
*  instances, for example, where American congresspersons have been barred from entering [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1357.8s)]
*  the West Bank to visit their family members like Rashida Tlaib is one of the famous examples of [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1362.92s)]
*  of the level of power and influence that Israel has over the lives of Palestinians, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1370.6000000000001s)]
*  but also even the lives of Americans. Is there like, do you want to go through that a little bit? [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1376.76s)]
*  I mean, there's no secret where, you know, we're a registered nonprofit, you know, we follow all the [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1382.2s)]
*  laws and rules and the regulations that are set forth in the US and abroad. So we do our best to [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1386.5200000000002s)]
*  follow the procedures and regulations that are put forth for us to follow. There's nothing, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1392.68s)]
*  there's no secret, there's no magic to it. It's just a matter of, you know, following what they [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1397.88s)]
*  have, you know, whatever they put forward works, so there's no reason to go around it or make it [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1402.92s)]
*  more complicated. So that's what we do. We follow the process and trust that it'll work. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1408.6000000000001s)]
*  So one of the questions I wanted to ask you was about your day-to-day experiences with [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1415.16s)]
*  the Israeli occupying force. Like, if you could give a, like, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1425.0s)]
*  if you could elaborate on your personal experiences of like how the Israeli occupying forces [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1433.08s)]
*  will restrict your travel, for example, things that people might not be aware of. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1440.2s)]
*  Yeah, like in terms of borders, we know like all borders between Jordanian [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1446.44s)]
*  River to the Mediterranean Sea are controlled by the Israeli forces, you know. Palestinians [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1452.28s)]

*  Everything is controlled by the Israeli soldiers. So yeah, a lot of Palestinians are banned also to [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1465.08s)]
*  travel outside and the millions of refugee, Palestinian refugees that have lost their homes [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1471.08s)]

*  to their homes until today. In the day-to-day life under the occupation, like I would say people, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1485.0s)]
*  the best example people, watch no other land and sadly until now we don't have a distribution in [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1491.96s)]
*  the U.S. We had me and my friend Hamdan and colleague in this work put so much efforts [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1498.84s)]
*  and take so much risks on our life, on our homes to document this evidence [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1508.12s)]
*  to find out that distributors in the U.S. doesn't want to take one step of courage [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1516.6799999999998s)]
*  to take such a movie and to show to the people. And the people in the U.S. must [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1523.3999999999999s)]
*  know what's happening because their countries is a key player. Their money actually is doing [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1529.8799999999999s)]
*  what is doing to us and they should know what's going on with their money on our life. Why [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1536.6799999999998s)]
*  a village like mine can't have a clean water pipe to drink water or we can't build a school [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1545.5600000000002s)]
*  or electricity or Hamdan for example has a home demolition order on his home and can be destroyed [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1553.96s)]
*  at any moment today and actually the whole village where he lives. And this is sad that [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1561.96s)]
*  that the people until today does not know what's going on or what their government supports [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1570.76s)]
*  and for that we come with this movie. We're doing tours. We're bringing it to theaters and [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=1578.36s)]

*  virtually impossible for palestinians to get construction permits from what I understand [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=2025.96s)]
*  it's about like what 98 percent of the construction permits that palestinians apply for in terms of [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=2029.96s)]
*  building wells or or any sort of like water supply is denied rejected by the israeli government [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=2035.32s)]

*  it's palestinians doing illegal stuff we are enforcing the law but the law actually written [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=2099.64s)]
*  by israeli commander you know and in this game soldiers court government settlers working [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=2105.24s)]

*  well i i think that it is um it's mostly because everything that israel is doing is doing for [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=2421.88s)]
*  america like i think that this is this dynamic exists not only because um a lot of wealthy [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=2429.24s)]
*  donors have given trump including uh mary maddelson uh who's given donald trump a hundred [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=2437.56s)]

*  to dominate the region and uh and seemingly they see uh palestinians as a [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=2457.7200000000003s)]
*  as getting in the way of of israel having complete control over the region [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=2465.48s)]
*  yeah i mean it's insane how trump sometimes would use words that israel is too tiny or too small and [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=2471.56s)]
*  should like make it bigger or like uh we will take gaza or like displace two million people [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=2477.32s)]

*  where america's attention is and and and what they want to allow israel to do having said all of that [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=2545.64s)]

*  away from the west bank or away from gaza and that's virtually impossible without a complete [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=2569.88s)]
*  full-blown holocaust style activities would have to bring for bring the palestinians into israel [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=2576.2s)]
*  like with citizenship and then that would make it impossible for them to deny the apartheid [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=2587.64s)]
*  do you feel like that's uh the the uh worst case scenario like is there i don't think israel will [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=2593.96s)]
*  do that and if they do if if they will do that it's still apartheid system because apartheid [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=2602.3599999999997s)]
*  system is exists between the river to the sea for all the palestinians in different levels for sure [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=2608.12s)]
*  the palestinians who hold even israeli citizenship under the system [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=2614.2s)]

*  the palestinian people are because from my estimation it seems like the palestinian authority [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=2701.08s)]
*  in many instances is operating as a part of the israeli security apparatus [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=2707.24s)]
*  operating sometimes alongside israel yeah so the palestinian authority was founded because [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=2714.52s)]

*  and hit one three-year-old child with a rock in his head and he was seriously attacked [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3127.0s)]

*  it was everywhere in the media a lot of journalists come and talk about what's what happened to this [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3178.68s)]
*  community so one week after this soldier that was telling me i started the fire i'm telling him you [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3184.52s)]
*  start the fire had a gopro camera on his body and he took this clip passed it to the settlers the [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3189.88s)]
*  settlers passed it to channel 12 in israel which is mainstream media and they said this [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3196.6s)]
*  activist basel adra started a fire on a palestinian home to accuse the jews of [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3203.72s)]
*  you know when they victimize themselves they don't mention israelis the jews you know [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3209.96s)]
*  started the fire and in fact there was no fire at any home the fire were like in a wood [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3214.04s)]
*  a place and this is like made me a subject of virtual attacks by like israeli like journalists [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3220.04s)]
*  and like you know settlers and right wing and all of this yeah um oh no i yeah i can't say [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3229.0s)]
*  how i feel i can't be as honest as i want to in this moment but um i'm sorry that happened [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3237.24s)]
*  uh that's you know uh fairly commonplace across the board even i mean it's nothing in comparison [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3243.7999999999997s)]
*  to your experiences but yes if you do defend palestinians and their humanity in any capacity [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3250.4399999999996s)]
*  even in the western world regardless of uh your background you could be a christian [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3258.2s)]
*  regardless of uh your background you could be a christian you could be jewish in america and [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3263.48s)]
*  they will still say you are a terrorist you love terrorism even though that is such a ridiculous [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3269.48s)]
*  thing to say in this dynamic considering that the terror is america and israel uh israel is the one [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3277.08s)]
*  that's doing the terrorism everything that you've described from your own personal experience [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3283.2400000000002s)]
*  and everything that we've read about that that uh humanitarian rights organizations work to [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3288.68s)]
*  to unearth and to show to the rest of the world is indeed definitionally true terror [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3295.4s)]
*  but it's being dished out by the united states of america and israel so it doesn't [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3302.44s)]
*  it's never considered a terrorism even when the icc sees it as terrorism even when the icj the [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3306.36s)]
*  international court of justice sees it as terrorism so um i have two questions one um [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3313.48s)]
*  let's say there are this is a western audience let's say that there are people who uh are are [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3323.56s)]
*  in israel because i have israeli fans as well they're leftists they're anti-zionists but [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3330.76s)]
*  if there was anything that you could say to someone living in israel who is entertaining [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3337.08s)]
*  the notion of joining the idf what would you what would you tell them i don't know if i want to if [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3342.76s)]
*  if i am the right person to tell them uh they mean that the people going to the idea here [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3348.76s)]
*  because for us they are the only they are the ones committing those things to us so uh [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3354.1200000000003s)]
*  uh things are are clear there on the ground you know it's not just it's not like i am here i'm [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3360.28s)]
*  talking to you when when you are on the ground you understand more and better and uh and the [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3366.52s)]
*  only reason you would continue doing so what you are doing is just if you are a racist you know [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3372.92s)]
*  because other people normal people would immediately understand that this is a normal this is unjust [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3378.68s)]
*  and this is crimes and unless you are a criminal and racist and support these things you would [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3384.2s)]
*  be in that place you know supporting these crimes and be part of it what do you think about uh [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3390.28s)]
*  people who have actually uh joined organizations like breaking the silence for example after [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3395.4s)]
*  doing tours on all of these activists are our friends you know we know them we we we work [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3400.76s)]
*  together today and we know almost we know all the israeli left wing activists because they [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3407.7200000000003s)]
*  since long time until today they come to us and they uh we do all of that our most of our activism [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3414.12s)]
*  together yeah so let me ask you about that actually because so uval abraham played a role [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3421.4s)]
*  in this in the making of this documentary i've actually uh uh really admired his work uh for a [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3426.84s)]
*  long time at 972 magazine local calls another one that do does a lot of investigative reporting on [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3434.36s)]
*  all of the uh horrible things that the israeli military is doing um sometimes that even has the [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3440.2000000000003s)]
*  capacity to penetrate into the western world ironically enough from where i'm standing [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3446.6s)]
*  when we look at israeli news even if it's haaretz which is not an anti-zionist paper at all or even [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3452.2s)]
*  if it's sometimes uh ynet or even sometimes jerusalem post it's more honest than american [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3458.92s)]
*  media because i feel like they don't feel the need to uh to to d they don't need they don't [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3465.64s)]
*  feel the need to like uh make it seem like is what israel is doing is moral because if your [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3474.12s)]
*  audience is already israeli they already they already have decided that palestinians are not [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3479.7999999999997s)]
*  human and must be dominated whereas in the new york times here in the united states of america [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3486.92s)]
*  i think that they uh they sanitize it they yeah because you like i think one of the reasons and [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3493.24s)]
*  big reasons because it's funded by the u.s and the u.s doesn't want to say that we're funding [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3501.0s)]
*  yeah yeah absolutely for sure it's predominantly funded by us both our tax dollars but also directly [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3506.84s)]
*  funded by american christian groups for example um there is uh the the largest donors to the west [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3517.24s)]
*  bank specifically in and the settler operations is the christians united for israel kufi it's a [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3524.12s)]
*  evangelical zionist group and it is comprised entirely of christians it's funded entirely by [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3531.8s)]
*  christians and it's christians like uh the the guy mike huckabee that donald trump just put as a [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3537.08s)]
*  in charge of the west bank from uh from the american perspective that uh believe in these [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3545.48s)]
*  like insane biblical reasons as to why the entire region must be given to jewish people so that they [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3551.72s)]
*  can trigger a rapture and uh you know jesus christ will come back to earth in their estimation it's [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3558.04s)]
*  it's truly psychotic uh it's insane now another question i have i guess is um there are obviously [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3564.6s)]
*  uh jewish israelis who put their bodies on the line as well do you feel like that is [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3572.92s)]
*  uh given the the ethno-supremacist values that uh zionists have or given the ethno-supremacist [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3579.16s)]
*  values that israel has do you feel like when uh when there are jewish activists side by side [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3587.48s)]
*  with you that they there is less harm in general well they sometimes been attacked and arrested a [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3594.84s)]
*  lot of times but we are like they don't face what we face as the balesinians uh most of the cases [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3603.16s)]
*  because you know in the end of the day they have the privilege because they are israelis they're [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3612.68s)]
*  they're like some of them are our friends you know and we we we talk every day and we work [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3616.52s)]
*  together and go to the field but still they are israelis they know that they have the privilege [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3623.88s)]
*  and not necessarily you know you know they like in a lot of cases uh there was israeli israeli [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3629.16s)]
*  activists and still the harm would be the same for example in burk in uh beta where american [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3636.44s)]
*  activists were shot in the head and killed and there was other like american activists yeah [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3645.24s)]
*  american activists the turkish american and and israeli activists who were like side by side with [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3650.52s)]
*  here and balesinians and still the same in masaf riyadh yeah almost all sometimes it would make [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3655.3199999999997s)]
*  the harm less depends on the situation but sometimes like most of the times no you know [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3661.9599999999996s)]
*  sometimes would come to to commit a pogrom and to burn homes or attack people they would keep [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3666.8399999999997s)]
*  doing it even if they see is it the activist israeli prime minister's office says israel agreed [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3672.84s)]
*  to u.s uh proposal for extending gaza ceasefire in return for the release of hostages but is [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3677.6400000000003s)]
*  claiming that hamas is refusing as of now this just in this just came out which is of course [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3682.84s)]
*  a lie and they have lied about this every step of the way they don't want to go to phase two [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3690.1200000000003s)]
*  they don't want to go to phase two but i um well it's it's currently it's ramadan right now [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3695.96s)]
*  in many instances at least historically ramadan is a time for israel to really escalate its violence [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3704.52s)]
*  in the west bank specifically and as a matter of fact many of the um many of the instances where [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3711.96s)]
*  hamas has retaliated uh have happened during this time frame uh it is joseph maybe i mean [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3717.48s)]
*  what's up that they escalate the situation in jerusalem yes yes yes at the al-aqsa mosque [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3725.16s)]
*  specifically israel will come in uh will refuse uh for people to to even visit the al-aqsa mosque [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3730.52s)]
*  and then will uh sometimes commit a siege on the al-aqsa mosque i'm sure you can uh speak to that [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3739.08s)]
*  as well from your personal experience and then even harm palestinians sometimes even killing [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3746.68s)]
*  palestinians in the process and then there will be retaliation that comes from the gaza strip [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3753.0s)]
*  and then israel will use that retaliation to go and bomb the gaza strip this is usually how this [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3759.48s)]
*  process works having said that this time considering that there has already been a siege in gaza [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3766.44s)]
*  and ethnic cleansing that has been happening in gaza and israel is already focusing its efforts [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3772.6s)]
*  on the west bank how do you think that this ramadan period will will play itself out [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3778.04s)]
*  i think they still this year they have they have decided i think to prevent young people to attend [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3788.44s)]
*  to al-aqsa mosque you know for the for the audience people that's watching us we are from [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3795.64s)]
*  the west bank we can't go to the al-aqsa mosque anyway we because it's technically inside the wall [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3799.08s)]
*  the separation wall and we need a permission that we will never get to go there so [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3808.28s)]
*  al-baal from the west bank don't go to pray in al-aqsa mosque in the previous years some of the [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3814.6800000000003s)]
*  people would have permissions and exceptions uh to go to go pray in al-aqsa mosque and most of [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3820.12s)]
*  escalations would happen with the prayers in yeah in al-aqsa today i see and most of the fridays [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3827.0s)]
*  since the beginning of the war israel is preventing young people to attend to prayers in the al-aqsa [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3835.16s)]
*  mosque we're talking about people from east jurusalem and 48 like from inside the green line [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3839.72s)]
*  not the west bank uh we are at all prevented to go there and i think today in ramadan as well [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3844.92s)]
*  they're preventing young people to attend to the prayer only from 50 and up that can go into a [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3852.8399999999997s)]
*  al-aqsa mosque they see in this a chance you know that they can now control and change the [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3858.92s)]
*  situation in the in al-aqsa mosque as well yeah here this is what i was talking about with respect [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3864.12s)]
*  to israeli media versus american media where harit says netanyahu stall stage two and once again [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3870.52s)]
*  weaponizes israel's grief the inertia of stage one and the result in dramatic change in the [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3876.92s)]
*  israeli public mood will soon clash with the prime minister's plan to obfuscate and prevaricate they [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3880.6s)]
*  their analysis also is still not necessarily speaking on the humanity of the palestinians [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3886.12s)]
*  but the anger that israelis feel towards their own government but then you look at the american [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3892.12s)]
*  you look at the american news and it says hamas rejects israel's request to extend phase one of [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3899.0s)]

*  they they say you're wrong you're uh this show shown also the cowardice of the israeli if the [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3909.48s)]
*  american leaders when they when biden set up a proposal and hamas accepted and then they [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3915.64s)]
*  and netanyahu rejected and then the american the american government say oh hamas rejecting [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3921.64s)]
*  and refusing to the hamas like saying no we are accepting it and now the same thing a proposal by [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3926.2000000000003s)]
*  the americans that has phase one phase two and phase three i think phase one ended and israel [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3931.96s)]
*  refusing to go to phase two and american media says hamas is is rejecting like to go to yeah [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3937.88s)]
*  when they when it's it's you know nothing to it's not it's not the truth in this country [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3944.6s)]
*  you you're not allowed to blame netanyahu for anything no always right no of course yes i mean [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3950.52s)]
*  you know going back to this of course that's this image says it all yeah obviously so what else [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3958.84s)]
*  there's some there's some other there's some other questions that i i wanted to ask you before [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3966.04s)]
*  i let you guys go because thank you so much for taking the time out to come here and we're also [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3970.52s)]
*  a close to tripling the goal by the way for rebuilding alliance fundraiser we are now [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3975.32s)]
*  officially at 70 holy moly we are at mashaAllah we're at seventy three thousand four hundred and [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3981.56s)]
*  nineteen dollars raised thank you since you guys got here do they know about anti-bds laws oh yeah [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3990.04s)]
*  that's actually an interesting question do you know that it is in 34 or i think it might be 37 [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=3997.4s)]
*  now in 37 states in the united states of america it is illegal to protest israel it's illegal to [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4004.76s)]
*  boycott you obviously you know bds boycott divestments and sanctions it's a illegal you [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4010.36s)]
*  can't get a job if you want to get a job in texas for example as a public school teacher [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4017.08s)]
*  you have to sign a document that says you will never up you will never advocate for boycotts [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4021.7999999999997s)]
*  you will never advocate for divestments and you will never advocate for sanctions against the [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4028.7599999999998s)]
*  state of israel yeah it's insane yeah this is why in spite of all of this and in spite of the media [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4033.0s)]
*  blackout and in spite of the the abject lies that western media tells i am still i still look at [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4041.64s)]
*  everything that's going on and i still see the the genuine attitude shift and the momentum in the [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4048.6s)]
*  direction of recognizing the humanity of of palestinian people as a as as still a a sign [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4055.16s)]
*  of of things to change and especially on the other side i think israel is a pariah state [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4065.56s)]
*  no matter what going forward like our leaders and i think in the arab world and in turkey as well [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4073.08s)]
*  but in in the arab world i think people understand this a little bit better where [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4081.64s)]
*  um the opinion of politicians and the government is very different than the opinion of the [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4085.56s)]
*  populations where like you look at muhammad bin salman or you look at the jordanian king [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4094.6800000000003s)]
*  uh participating in security cooperations with the israeli state whereas the jordanian population [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4100.92s)]
*  or even the saudi population i think have a very different uh attitude about the israeli state [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4106.76s)]
*  and i think that's kind of what's happening in the western world right now as well especially [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4114.92s)]
*  with younger generations where they're recognizing this cold hard truth that there is no real [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4119.08s)]
*  democracy in this process and that regardless of uh how much you protest that the american [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4126.84s)]
*  government is still going to give billions and billions of dollars to israel and that um and i [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4133.08s)]
*  think that that is inevitably going to create a contradiction that has to resolve where uh one [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4139.16s)]
*  side's got to give and i still am a firm believer that the side that will give is uh is western [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4146.04s)]
*  nations and western governments that slowly but surely uh move away from the unconditional support [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4152.28s)]
*  they offer to israel especially as israel has become this pariah state in the way that people [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4159.24s)]
*  receive it i say western world because the rest of the world knows what's up but you know western [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4167.72s)]
*  europe is like one of the only places in america is one of the only places where people have uh [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4173.639999999999s)]
*  yeah people have held this like loyalty to israel and they're yeah and they are yeah and they are [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4179.16s)]
*  the ones supporting israel and backing it and yeah so for that we keep calling europe and america [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4183.639999999999s)]
*  because most of the israel power comes from here yeah so let me ask you another thing do you foresee [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4190.84s)]
*  okay this is the last question i promise um do you foresee uh an attitude shift happening in israel [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4198.28s)]
*  at all this is a little bit of a tricky question do you think that there are more people more [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4206.04s)]
*  activists that you have seen in at least the west bank in terms of jewish activists now uh [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4211.96s)]
*  i'm not like experts in talking on about israeli society but they shifted more to the right wing [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4217.879999999999s)]
*  you know yeah like october 7th make uh most of the israeli shifting a lot to you know in any way [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4224.679999999999s)]
*  they were most of the population didn't care about the occupation before that and they were like [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4232.04s)]
*  yeah either they don't know or they don't they or they are not or they don't want to know you know [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4237.639999999999s)]
*  they don't want to open their eyes because they are living their own life and busy with it [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4243.0s)]
*  and doesn't see what they are doing to us after the wall and they don't mostly cross the wall to [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4247.0s)]
*  come to the west bank and i know that after october 7th they more shifted to the right yeah and i [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4253.24s)]
*  think again this is my opinion not theirs okay i think that there were a lot of people that uh are [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4261.0s)]
*  liberal zionists that uh were very critical about israel uh occupying the west bank [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4270.6s)]
*  and and i think that they recognize that that kind of looks bad to the western world and that's the [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4278.84s)]
*  reason why they were so critical of over it or maybe they truly did think that it was unacceptable [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4283.96s)]
*  i guess um or maybe they had a more serious approach to it where they thought you know if [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4289.64s)]
*  you do this then you make it impossible to have a two-state solution and if there's no possibility [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4295.240000000001s)]
*  for a two-state solution the inevitability is a one-state solution and we can't have that we can [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4299.32s)]
*  live side by side with the palestinians but regardless i think a lot of those people after [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4303.799999999999s)]
*  october 7 basically all dropped it completely and they were like no you know do what needs to be [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4310.2s)]
*  done i at least i did see that from a lot of the liberal zionist accounts that i saw on twitter [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4317.08s)]
*  people uh that initially would uh would would do activism in the west bank turning around and [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4324.280000000001s)]
*  and now saying stuff like no we have to pummel gaza we have to do everything we can um so okay [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4332.92s)]
*  this is definitely the last question i don't this might be you don't have to answer it okay gal Gadot [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4340.6s)]
*  is presenting the documentary award at the oscars yeah how how does that how does that work uh [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4346.360000000001s)]

*  west bank talking to people who have served in the israeli occupying force so it won't be a unique [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4373.08s)]
*  experience in that regard i guess but this time you will you know stand side by side we don't know [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9mT1IxEdo8&t=4377.8s)]
