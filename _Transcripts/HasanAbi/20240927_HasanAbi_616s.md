*  a chain of command, obviously, within that leadership [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCEeiC0Y-vE&t=607.64s)]
*  structure within that chain of command, there's going to be [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCEeiC0Y-vE&t=610.96s)]
*  other people that get elevated to that status. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCEeiC0Y-vE&t=612.76s)]
