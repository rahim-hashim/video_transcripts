# Switch 2 Just Launched | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhm4wQFqc4U)
*  Reportedly, we'll see. I'm also kind of bitter because like I said, this was going to happen last year and they literally waited 16 days for the revelation. If this was 17 days earlier, I would have actually gotten another one of my predictions right. Which is very annoying. Okay. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhm4wQFqc4U&t=0.0s)]
*  And yeah, Nintendo delivered switch to which is a major deal, I think, but not really here. I'm going to play the Nintendo switch to announcement while I go pee real quick, but I have a lot of thoughts on it. Okay. Here. Wow. That looks like a entirely new and entirely different console. That's crazy. I'm gonna be honest with you. It's kind of shocking and also, I mean, I guess it's not like that. And I'm going to have to pay more attention to. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhm4wQFqc4U&t=19.72s)]
*  that weird that Nintendo is still serving slop sausage, but like I would have expected [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhm4wQFqc4U&t=49.72s)]
*  them to at least like, I don't know, really push the envelope a little bit. That's as [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhm4wQFqc4U&t=57.3s)]
*  far as I understand. We'll see. I mean, it depends on the tech specs. It depends on it. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhm4wQFqc4U&t=62.9s)]
*  It depends entirely on the tech specs. Okay. But the reality of the matter is as steam [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhm4wQFqc4U&t=67.78s)]
*  decks, steam deck exists in the mobile gaming arena. You got like ASUS, rogue or whatever, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhm4wQFqc4U&t=75.64s)]
*  or whatever that thing is called. I don't, I don't, I didn't actually end up using it, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhm4wQFqc4U&t=83.39999999999999s)]
*  but like I'm a massive steam deck evangelist. As you guys know, it's very difficult for [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhm4wQFqc4U&t=87.16s)]
*  me to look at this and go, wow, I'm the rogue ally. Yeah. It's very difficult for me to [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhm4wQFqc4U&t=92.88s)]
*  look at this and go, I'm very excited about this new switch. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhm4wQFqc4U&t=98.28s)]
*  Bro, I can't use the chunky assets. And I'll be honest, it ain't portable at all. There [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhm4wQFqc4U&t=105.16s)]
*  are new hardware features yet to be revealed. Reportedly. We'll see. I'm also kind of bitter [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhm4wQFqc4U&t=122.44s)]
*  because like I said, this was going to happen last year and they literally waited 16 days [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhm4wQFqc4U&t=126.75999999999999s)]
*  for the revelation. If this was 17 days earlier, I would have actually gotten another one of [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhm4wQFqc4U&t=134.52s)]
*  my predictions, right? Which is very annoying. Okay. Like I said, this was going to happen [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhm4wQFqc4U&t=141.20000000000002s)]
*  and it did just 17 days after I, the last moment for this to happen. Basically. Anyway, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhm4wQFqc4U&t=146.68s)]
*  we'll see. I mean, look, I'm I'm steamed. I really cooked me in terms of my, my love [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhm4wQFqc4U&t=153.76000000000002s)]
*  and my admiration for switch. When I, I was always like a big Sony loyalist as you guys [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhm4wQFqc4U&t=160.48s)]
*  know, Sony PlayStation fan boy, as you guys know, but I always wanted a portable, I wanted [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhm4wQFqc4U&t=166.35999999999999s)]
*  something portable. Like I was a big PSP fan early on. I maintained the position that PSP [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhm4wQFqc4U&t=173.23999999999998s)]
*  was too technologically advanced for the timeframe. And it, and with a couple tweaks, it could [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhm4wQFqc4U&t=179.6s)]
*  have been the greatest thing of all time. It was, but unfortunately there wasn't enough [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhm4wQFqc4U&t=184.27999999999997s)]
*  like data storage readily available at the time. I had a lot of these, you know, I, I, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhm4wQFqc4U&t=188.08s)]
*  I've always wanted a mobile platform because I can, I wanted to play video games while [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhm4wQFqc4U&t=193.92000000000002s)]
*  I'm pooping and switch for the time being, especially because of the games. When I dove [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhm4wQFqc4U&t=199.44s)]
*  into it, shouts out to the Hassan Avi head who literally forcibly got me into playing [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhm4wQFqc4U&t=204.16000000000003s)]
*  switch games by sending me an animal crossing switch with a bunch of games. I mean, I've [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhm4wQFqc4U&t=211.60000000000002s)]
*  had a lot of great times on it. I've had a great, I've had a lot of great times on that [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhm4wQFqc4U&t=217.04s)]
*  platform. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhm4wQFqc4U&t=221.79999999999998s)]
*  Zelda, like for the first time ever I played a Zelda game. It was incredible. Yeah. It [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhm4wQFqc4U&t=222.79999999999998s)]
*  was ultra PG. So, you know, despite all the wonderful times I had with that thing, I'm [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhm4wQFqc4U&t=227.79999999999998s)]
*  telling you right now, man, the, the steam deck is just so goaded. It's very difficult [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhm4wQFqc4U&t=233.6s)]
*  for me to go back from that, you know, larger library of content, better specs. It's just [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhm4wQFqc4U&t=239.6s)]
*  too clunky and too chunky, but that's fine. You know, it's just, it is [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhm4wQFqc4U&t=246.12s)]
