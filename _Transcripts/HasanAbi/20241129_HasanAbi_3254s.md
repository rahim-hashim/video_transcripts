# What Is Happening In England | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [November 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0)
*  But when it comes to English Patriot... [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=0.0s)]
*  Okay, that lady has a bear. What is happening in England? What's going on? [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1.6s)]
*  Do they just have f***ing wild animals as pets in Dover? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=6.0s)]
*  That's a bear in it! [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=10.24s)]
*  That's a Malamute-Seawolf mix. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=11.68s)]
*  I think that's a Tomaskin. I'll have one too. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=14.4s)]
*  Not technically a wolf hybrid, but bred to look like one. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=16.48s)]
*  I do want to watch the England video though. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=25.36s)]
*  Actually, this one. The end of England by Ordinary Things. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=27.76s)]
*  This summer, my country went to hell. So I decided to follow it all the way to the bottom. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=31.360000000000003s)]
*  Towns across England went up in smoke as gangs of self-proclaimed Patriots decided to [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=37.04s)]
*  take their country back by setting it. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=42.24s)]
*  Their anger was focused on immigrants, legal and otherwise, surrounding ho- [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=45.28s)]
*  This was pretty crazy. It'll never not be strange that they just did a f***ing out and about. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=49.92s)]
*  And like, we just kind of moved past it, but I don't know. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=55.76s)]
*  ...hotels, housing recent arrivals and intimidating long-time residents. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=58.88s)]
*  The sorry display didn't make me feel very patriotic, but then again, nothing much has lately. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=64.0s)]
*  It's the one thing that everyone in England can agree on. Old place has gone to the dogs, mate. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=69.52s)]
*  Living standards, salaries, public services, investment, all in decline, while crime, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=74.64s)]
*  costs, prison populations and the percentage of human s*** in our swimming water [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=80.08s)]
*  spiralling ever upwards. Patriotic? Nah mate, couldn't be me. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=85.2s)]
*  But recently I've been wondering if my attitude is part of the problem. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  After all, how can you fix a country that you're ashamed to be a citizen of? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=94.08s)]
*  So to kindle some country love in the Ed, I took a trip to the most iconic natural thingy [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=98.88s)]
*  m'bob in the UK, the White Cliffs of Dover. A symbol of national pride and the last place [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  where England was successfully invaded from. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=109.68s)]
*  Here, at the end of England, I thought I might figure out where we went wrong. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=112.0s)]
*  I've been to a Spoons, bro. It's just, it's fine. It's like a normal, it's, it's not that cool. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=142.0s)]
*  Like it's fine. It's like a local pub, but a franchise instead. Like I don't understand. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=156.08s)]
*  It's like people being like, you gotta go to a f***ing Applebee's, bro. If you come to America, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=161.84s)]
*  you gotta go to Chipotle or not Chipotle, uh, uh, Chili's. Like it's a, I would rather go [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  to a local pub than go to a f***ing Spoons because I feel like Spoons is just like a [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=172.0s)]
*  cheapened version of it. You know, it's like a, like a mass produced version of a local pub. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=178.16s)]
*  But I'm not. You should look. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=202.16s)]
*  What? Did this guy volunteer? Dude, is every f***ing Uber slash taxi driver in the UK like this? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=203.36s)]
*  I'm not a racist out of nowhere. Like he just volunteered the information that he is. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=209.44s)]
*  As a matter of fact, indeed a racist. Yeah, my not a racist, but I am a gammon. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=215.44s)]
*  Look after your own people first. Uh, you know, if they can't control immigration, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=222.72s)]
*  you know, we've got our kids and that that need housing and stuff like that. And then it's like [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=228.23999999999998s)]
*  they get preferential treatment. Being the closest part of England to mainland Europe, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=232.72s)]
*  Dover has had an unlucky history because of this continental proximity. On a clear day, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=237.44s)]
*  you can see France and on a windy day, you can smell it. Although that might just be the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=242.4s)]
*  ferries swapping out their septic tanks. William the Conqueror landed in Dover in 1066, then marched [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=246.88s)]
*  his boys all the way up to Hastings where he shot King Harold in the eye jelly, forever immortalised [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=252.64s)]
*  on the world's most famous piece of wool as the last man to successfully invade the English. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=257.91999999999996s)]
*  During World War II, Dover suffered heavy bombing by the German Air Force, which accounts for the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=263.36s)]
*  stark architectural differences between the two halves of Dover's seafront. One side decaying [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=268.24s)]
*  Victorian grandeur, the other decaying post-war government housing. The landscape was the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=273.28s)]
*  backdrop for the Battle of Britain, where fighter pilots pushed back a possible German invasion. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=278.15999999999997s)]
*  Since then, Dover, and more specifically its iconic cliff face, have served as a potent symbol of [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=283.03999999999996s)]
*  English patriotism. Basloff always had a strange relationship with patriotism. It's our embarrassing [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=288.71999999999997s)]
*  relative we only invite around for international football tournaments and the occasional Christmas. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=294.64s)]
*  He crushes a couple of- [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=299.36s)]
*  Free lies on a shirt, George Rimet still gleaming, 30 years of hurt, never- [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=300.88s)]
*  What was it? Never Stop Me Believing? No, I forgot what the lyrics are. I got Jules Rimet [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=311.04s)]
*  still gleaming. Oh. Never Stop Me Dreaming. Good effort mate! [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=317.76s)]
*  Tinnies Before Noon makes some unsavory remarks about your cousin with the septum piercing, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=324.71999999999997s)]
*  and then does a sick on himself while watching the royal speech of full volume. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=329.44s)]
*  But I found that people in Dover had a sunnier view of patriotism. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=333.2s)]
*  Are you proud to be English? Oh yes, very patriotic. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=337.52s)]
*  And what about England makes you proud? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=340.64s)]
*  She f***ing Pugin it. What of it? You one of those f***ing Vokes? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=343.2s)]
*  You one of those f***ing slumber fascists, yeah? I'm a proud propaganda man. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=348.48s)]
*  Every single part of my being. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=352.8s)]
*  I think we've got a good system of government, if it worked. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=362.64s)]
*  We've got pretty much free to do as we please, haven't we? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=367.36s)]
*  Do you like Dover, proud to be a Dovidian? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=371.36s)]
*  It's Do-Dovidian. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=373.44s)]
*  Do-Morian, excuse me. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=374.48s)]
*  It's better than what it was. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=375.52s)]
*  It's better than what it was? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=377.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=378.08000000000004s)]
*  How so? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=378.96000000000004s)]
*  There was a lot of immigrants when we came here, but that's gone away now. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=379.44s)]
*  Do you think England's better now? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=383.76s)]
*  Dude, people are, yo, people need to stop. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=385.84s)]
*  I don't know what else to say. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=389.12s)]
*  I'm being kind. I'm trying to do this new thing. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=391.2s)]
*  I'm trying to do this new thing where I be kind, but people need to stop it. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=393.68s)]
*  Okay? All I'm going to say is stop it. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=399.12s)]
*  In the past? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=403.04s)]
*  I personally prefer the past. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=405.28s)]
*  What era? What year? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=407.84000000000003s)]
*  If I was born in the Victorian era, I think I'd be very, very... [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=409.44s)]
*  Bro has a wolf, by the way. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=412.24s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=413.6s)]
*  Like that's casually a literal half wolf dog. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=414.64s)]
*  There's a wolf dog hybrid. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=418.0s)]
*  No, there's not just a husky. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=419.6s)]
*  I just think there is a lot more manners. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=421.68s)]
*  But when it comes to English patriot... [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=423.76s)]
*  Okay, that lady has a bear. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=425.28000000000003s)]
*  What is happening in England? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=426.96s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=428.64s)]
*  Do they just have wild animals as pets in Dover? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=429.68s)]
*  That's a bear in it. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=433.92s)]
*  That's a Malamute-Seawolf mix. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=435.36s)]
*  I think that's a Tomaskin. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=438.08000000000004s)]
*  I have one too. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=439.36s)]
*  Not technically a wolf hybrid, but bred to look like one. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=440.16s)]
*  It's easy to observe a generational divide. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=444.72s)]
*  Are you proud to be English? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=447.92s)]
*  No. Sorry, but no. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=449.36s)]
*  Yeah. Ask any... [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=452.24s)]
*  I feel like ask any British person that don't have a football kid on, right? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=453.36s)]
*  After a f***ing game of footy. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=459.28000000000003s)]
*  And they'll tell you what is there to be proud of in this f***ing island. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=462.24s)]
*  I hate it. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=468.0s)]
*  I'm under 30 lad. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=469.04s)]
*  What do I have to look forward to? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=470.64s)]
*  Never retiring. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=472.96000000000004s)]
*  Worsening conditions. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=475.12s)]
*  Public transit never works. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=477.52000000000004s)]
*  F***ing hell. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=480.0s)]
*  We've had Tories ruling the country and now we got the f***ing Red Tories. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=481.12s)]
*  It's shite, mate. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=486.16s)]
*  English? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=488.0s)]
*  I don't mind it. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=488.72s)]
*  I mean, there's quite a lot of brutal stuff happens. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=489.6s)]
*  I don't like that we're known for being and like we're known to be quite dirty [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=493.04s)]
*  and overly polite as well. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=497.76000000000005s)]
*  I don't like that about British culture. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=499.36s)]
*  Yeah, because it comes across as fake as being too fake. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=502.0s)]
*  So I don't like that. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=504.56s)]
*  I'm not proud about that. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=505.44s)]
*  Growing up here, it's not the easiest. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=506.8s)]
*  Every single corner you turn, drug dealers. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=509.20000000000005s)]
*  Welcome to Dover. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=512.24s)]

*  F*** you mean bow, bro. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=515.52s)]
*  What are you going to use the blunderbuss? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=517.0400000000001s)]
*  Like what do you mean bow? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=518.8s)]
*  You don't got f***ing guns. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=521.3599999999999s)]
*  You don't got guns, dude. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=522.8s)]
*  Cross bro, innit? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=524.8s)]
*  Making a documentary about Dover. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=527.5999999999999s)]
*  So a lot of young people in England today feel completely alienated from the idea of patriotism. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=531.12s)]
*  It's outdated. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=536.88s)]
*  It's unethical. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=538.0s)]
*  And crucially, it is cringe. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=539.3599999999999s)]
*  But I spoke to one young Dover resident filled to the brim with... [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=542.0799999999999s)]
*  Okay, bro. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=546.0s)]
*  This... [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=546.7199999999999s)]
*  I mean, look, I'm not going to judge a book by its cover. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=547.28s)]
*  And I'm trying endlessly to be positive about British people. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=550.64s)]
*  Okay, but that looks like a Nazi. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=555.76s)]
*  Like that, I'm sorry. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=558.0799999999999s)]
*  That looks like we got those here. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=561.68s)]
*  Okay, we got them here too on this side of the pond. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=564.0799999999999s)]
*  That's a paedophile in the making, at least by the looks of it. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=566.9599999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=570.16s)]
*  A Tory. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=570.72s)]
*  It's just, he's too young to be a paedophile at this moment. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=573.04s)]
*  But he'll get there. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=577.52s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=578.56s)]
*  Once he reaches of age. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=579.4399999999999s)]
*  Patriotism. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=581.68s)]
*  Not for England, mind you, but for a country of his own creation. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=582.88s)]
*  What? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=586.4s)]
*  Would you renounce your English citizenship if you were able to return to Verdis and live there permanently? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=586.8s)]
*  If we could build Verdis' international recognition, then I think we would certainly... [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=593.1999999999999s)]
*  I would certainly consider renouncing my citizenship. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=598.56s)]
*  If you haven't heard of Verdis, that isn't a surprise. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=600.9599999999999s)]
*  The nation existed physically for about 48 hours. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=604.24s)]
*  Daniel and a small band of fellow patriots decided to start a new country [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=607.6s)]
*  on an unclaimed half-kilometer of floodland wedged between Serbia and Croatia. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=611.6s)]
*  It remains unclaimed today thanks to a weird quirk of geopolitical loophole. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=616.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm sorry, I'm not into biological predeterminism by any means, okay? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=622.1600000000001s)]
*  But that is the most British thing you can fucking do, okay? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=628.4000000000001s)]
*  I'm sorry, you can't just go, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=634.56s)]
*  oh, there's land there, it's unclaimed, it's mine now, like the good old days, innit? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=638.3199999999999s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=643.52s)]
*  This is literally, he just unlocked epigenetic memories. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=645.2s)]
*  It's looking proper. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=648.88s)]
*  Might as well put a fucking flag on it, yeah? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=650.4s)]
*  Call it mine. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=653.2s)]
*  Like, American sovereign citizens go around annoying people [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=654.48s)]
*  and reading out the rules that they think magically, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=660.48s)]
*  that create supposedly a magical barrier around them [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=666.56s)]
*  that stops them from being harmed by the police or whatever when it's not the case. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=669.36s)]
*  British libertarian sovereign citizens are like, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=673.36s)]
*  oh, we got to do more colonies, right? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=675.84s)]
*  The problem was we needed 14 colonies, not 13, yeah? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=679.68s)]
*  Fucking hell. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=684.3199999999999s)]
*  Hullery. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=685.8399999999999s)]
*  Neither Croatia nor Serbia claim it because they are arguing over larger, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=686.88s)]
*  more liveable pieces of land to Verdus' south. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=691.1999999999999s)]
*  I'm looking forward to hopefully being back on the land at some point, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=694.56s)]
*  and we did actually go back to Verdus recently. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=697.04s)]
*  We can't land the boats, obviously, because the Croatian authorities wouldn't allow us, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=699.1999999999999s)]
*  but because it's an international waterway, there was no problem with us doing so. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=702.56s)]
*  On his first visit, Daniel and the other founding Vardisians [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=706.16s)]
*  valiantly held onto their new home, suffering sleepless nights and one instance of heavy hail. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=709.5999999999999s)]
*  All before Croatian authorities arrived and ejected them from a patch of land that [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=715.04s)]
*  isn't even technically Croatia. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=719.12s)]
*  Ever since, President Jackson and his cabinet have been governing in exile in Dover. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=721.1999999999999s)]
*  Governments were in exile during World War II, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=726.64s)]
*  they still refer to themselves as a state and such. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=728.3199999999999s)]
*  We still continue to do the same thing, even though we are in exile. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=730.7199999999999s)]
*  We have so many different opportunities. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=734.64s)]
*  It's a small country, so we can test new systems of government. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=736.7199999999999s)]
*  Dog, if you want your own formal governance to be established as a sovereign state, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=739.4399999999999s)]
*  you just have to become what's the guy, the bank guy, the bank family that owns an island [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=743.44s)]
*  off the coast of England. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=749.2s)]
*  That's what you got to do. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=750.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=751.7600000000001s)]
*  All you got to do is become wealthy enough that you can just like, oh, the just no, not sea. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=752.08s)]
*  No, I don't think it's sea land. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=758.08s)]
*  The principality of sea land. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=759.44s)]
*  No, is it sea land? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=761.0400000000001s)]
*  Is that what it's called? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=762.5600000000001s)]
*  I don't think it was called the guy that owned the guy that owns a fucking island. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=763.36s)]
*  The two brothers that own an island off the coast of no, the two brothers that own an island [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=767.12s)]
*  off the coast of fucking off the coast of England. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=772.32s)]
*  And they tried the Island of Guernsey. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=775.9200000000001s)]
*  I think, yeah, I think it is the Island of Guernsey. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=777.7600000000001s)]
*  Maybe that that tried to get established sovereignty, but it didn't work. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=779.7600000000001s)]
*  The Barclays. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=789.0400000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=789.9200000000001s)]
*  This, this Bresho is one of the channel islands located off the West coast of Sark, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=791.12s)]
*  where they are now geographically detached from one another Bresho, Brett Breco Bresho. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=796.48s)]
*  Is politically part of both Sark and the bailic of Guernsey. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=802.32s)]
*  It has been established in the courts that Bresho is a tenement of Sark. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=806.1600000000001s)]
*  The Ministry of Justice, the Department of United Kingdom Government with the [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=809.6800000000001s)]
*  responsibilities for the channel islands considers Bresho a part of Sark. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=812.8000000000001s)]
*  There's just like one chateau on it. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=818.08s)]
*  The Barclay brothers built this. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=819.6s)]
*  And we can be a bit of humanitarian outpost. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=821.7600000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of things that we can do to say, for example, compared to an NGO [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=824.32s)]
*  that can only be subject to a couple of things. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=828.48s)]
*  Daniel had a real talent for saying things that were broadly positive without saying [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=830.8000000000001s)]
*  much of any actual substance. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=834.8000000000001s)]
*  To me, it seemed like he had a bright career ahead of him in international politics. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=836.8000000000001s)]
*  You know, with the design of the flag, I understand a lot of people mistake it for Argentina. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=841.6s)]
*  I thought it was an Argentinian trans pride flag. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=846.48s)]
*  I see. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=849.2s)]
*  So how many citizens have you got now? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=849.7600000000001s)]
*  We have 300, no, 399 citizens at the moment on the exact as I checked earlier today, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=851.44s)]
*  even though it's literally just a large amount of trees everywhere. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=858.4s)]
*  It's community and it feels very different. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=863.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=865.92s)]
*  The community has evaporated and that's why a lot of people don't feel as much an attachment to [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=866.3199999999999s)]
*  their national identity, right? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=872.0s)]
*  Is that there is less community, but you've built this community [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=873.4399999999999s)]
*  partly by staking land in this unusual way, but in a more. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=876.48s)]
*  I wouldn't say it's an unusual way, especially for British people. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=880.48s)]
*  I feel like it's the most usual way that British people operate. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=884.3199999999999s)]
*  Am I crazy? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=887.36s)]
*  I guess it's unusual because no one for once, there's no one that lives there for once. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=888.4s)]
*  Relatable way to a lot of people you've found the community online, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=893.04s)]
*  because that's where most of the discussion about this country takes place now, right? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=896.0s)]
*  Nowadays, yes. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=899.84s)]
*  Daniel might be an extreme case, but I think his story speaks to an alienation [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=900.88s)]
*  that a lot of English people feel in the age of the internet and an ever better connected world. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=905.36s)]
*  It can be easier to forge a community with people thousands of miles away [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=910.64s)]
*  than with people in your local town or even your own country. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=914.88s)]
*  Dover is one of Europe's busiest ports with up to 10,000 trucks passing through every day. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=918.4s)]
*  But the town doesn't benefit much from all this traffic. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=923.68s)]
*  Like many UK seaside towns, it has suffered deep economic decline for the last 20 years. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=926.48s)]
*  It rarely makes headlines and when it does, it's probably because part of its iconic cliff base [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=931.76s)]
*  has collapsed, potent symbolism I know, or because of the many asylum seekers [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=936.3199999999999s)]
*  and illegal immigrants who arrive on Dover shores. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=940.9599999999999s)]
*  When polled, immigration and asylum compete only with health and the economy as the issue [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=944.72s)]
*  that the English get most riled up about. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=949.12s)]
*  But it's also the most polarizing issue in the country because of how partisan reporting on the topic is. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=951.04s)]
*  When it comes to the tragic loss of life during channel crossings, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=956.24s)]
*  then both sides of the political spectrum are interested in relaying the facts. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=959.4399999999999s)]
*  But this is where balanced reporting on the topic ends. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=963.12s)]
*  Thanks to this channel's longtime sponsor, Ground News, this divide is made starkly clear. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=966.08s)]
*  They're an app and website I use to challenge mainstream media's reductive narratives on the [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=970.8000000000001s)]
*  most nuanced issues we face today. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=974.4s)]
*  Their platform gathers related news in one place and then points out political bias or corporate [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=976.32s)]
*  backing that may be skewing or suppressing the facts. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=980.64s)]
*  Time and again, the Ground News blind spot feed shows that stories about illegal immigration [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=984.0s)]
*  are the near-exclusive domain of right-wing media. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=988.72s)]
*  Even when Oxford University publishes a politically neutral study finding Britain has the [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=991.6s)]
*  most illegal migrants in Europe, it's completely ignored by the left-leaning press. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=995.52s)]
*  It's easy to write this news off as just another example of hostile political discourse. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=999.6s)]
*  But Ground News also lists original research so no matter what political ideology you [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1003.6s)]
*  personally subscribe to, you know where the information is coming from. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1007.6s)]
*  Both sides of the political spectrum in England are guilty of only wanting to confirm the biases [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1011.0400000000001s)]
*  of their regular readership. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1016.4s)]
*  The right obsessively gobbles up any crime story related to migrants or [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1018.0s)]
*  stats involving the cost of housing them. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1022.24s)]
*  But they will rarely know anything about the migrants themselves or the unique geopolitical [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1024.16s)]
*  situations that they're fleeing from. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1028.32s)]
*  Meanwhile, the left and liberal press will have a more informed take on the global refugee [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1030.08s)]
*  crisis as a whole but are then strategically silent when it comes to the challenges that [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1034.56s)]
*  illegal immigration might pose to poorer communities in the UK. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1038.1599999999999s)]
*  This is why I think Ground News is such an incredible tool when it comes to bursting [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1041.2s)]
*  your own bubble. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1044.32s)]

*  Once upon a 10 years ago smuggling people into England was a high cost low margin business. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1077.12s)]
*  People attempted to cross the channel secretly in the backs of trucks arriving in Dover by [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1083.36s)]
*  ferry. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1088.0s)]
*  Professional smugglers charged upwards of 9,000 euros per traveller leaving most of [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1088.88s)]
*  their potential customer base to try their luck on unsuspecting vehicles instead. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1093.52s)]
*  At the time only around 12,000 people were detected crossing every year. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1099.04s)]
*  That all changed after Brexit when security checks tightened- [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1104.08s)]
*  He's adjacent to the weird drama YouTube circle with Kim and Muda. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1107.6s)]
*  Okay that's actually kind of surprising to me because he definitely is intelligent and I feel [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1111.04s)]
*  like a lot of the Keemstar adjacent drama orbiters have one factor. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1115.76s)]
*  I don't think that that is true. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1119.84s)]
*  Like regardless of his opinions of me he's like very clearly a decent well researched [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1121.44s)]
*  YouTube essayist. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1129.84s)]
*  And border infrastructure improved rendering many of these attempted clandestine crossings [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1131.12s)]
*  unsuccessful. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1136.64s)]
*  But these increased border security measures inadvertently led to more illegal crossings [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1138.32s)]
*  overall as smuggling networks turned to the small boats as an alternative. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1143.36s)]
*  Since the pandemic small boat crossings have skyrocketed peaking in 2022 when over 45,000 [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1148.24s)]
*  people made their way across the channel illegally. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1154.56s)]
*  It is now a popular and profitable business as smugglers are able to charge a fraction [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1157.4399999999998s)]
*  of what they used to mostly because they are overloading their boats with up to 60 [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1162.6399999999999s)]
*  passengers at a time on vessels designed for a maximum of 30. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1167.36s)]
*  Leading to an increased number of deaths by drowning every year. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1171.76s)]
*  Successive prime ministers and you know we've had at least four since the crisis began [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1176.4799999999998s)]
*  have pledged to crack down on the crossings and all have seemingly failed. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1181.84s)]
*  The government has lost control of our borders and we can see that with the number of crossings [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1185.76s)]
*  there are across the channel in small boats. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1189.84s)]
*  We have to stop that and I think the only way to stop that is to smash the gangs that [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1192.56s)]
*  are running this vile trade. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1197.9199999999998s)]
*  Each government has focused mostly on stricter enforcement and more effective policing of the [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1199.76s)]
*  border with the British government handing French border forces 150 million pounds a [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1204.6399999999999s)]
*  year to prevent further crossings. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1209.6799999999998s)]
*  But just like the tightened security on the ferries a decade ago this is also having [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1212.08s)]
*  unintended consequences. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1216.72s)]
*  The smugglers are hurrying launches to evade police and crowding boats far beyond their [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1218.88s)]
*  capacity to make up for earlier intercepted launches. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1223.6000000000001s)]
*  As a result 2024 has been the deadliest year for channel crossings on record while harsher [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1227.3600000000001s)]
*  policing hasn't made a dent in the number of crossings overall. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1232.96s)]
*  It's all a bit depressing really which is why most Brits prefer to just look the other way [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1236.88s)]
*  and pretend it isn't happening. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1242.0800000000002s)]
*  But for a growing minority illegal immigration has become the defining issue of our time. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1244.0800000000002s)]
*  Okay let's talk about the riots. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1249.52s)]
*  They started in Southport a semi-deprived seaside town in the northwest of England. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1251.8400000000001s)]
*  The riot was sparked by the brutal murder of three young girls that had occurred the [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1256.72s)]
*  day before. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1260.56s)]
*  The 17 year old suspect was arrested but authorities kept his identity hidden as British [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1262.0s)]
*  law provides anonymity for anyone under 18 when they are accused of a crime. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1266.8s)]
*  But this allowed online rumours to run rampant as foreign news aggregate sites and anonymous [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1271.52s)]
*  Twitter accounts spread the rumour that the suspect was a South Asian asylum seeker who [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1278.8s)]
*  had arrived via small boat the previous year. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1283.44s)]
*  Like that right there is it that's it it's it one dude one random fucking insane dude [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1288.4s)]
*  does a heinous crime and then pogrom start your society is deeply unwell and it's [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1295.68s)]
*  fundamentally broken. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1301.2s)]
*  Okay it's over at that point it's just is over you got to fucking wipe the slate clean [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1302.56s)]
*  and restart to me that is like the greatest indication that this is a society that is [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1307.68s)]
*  collapsing in on itself. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1313.12s)]
*  Okay America's not entirely there yet but we are getting there. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1315.76s)]
*  It wasn't even that my guy they lied about him being Muslim and other bullshit like even [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1318.8799999999999s)]
*  if he was Muslim it doesn't matter chat what are we talking about like even if he was [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1322.56s)]
*  literally like a Muslim refugee who was like I'm doing this in the name of Allah because [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1327.04s)]
*  I hate England. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1332.32s)]
*  The idea that like you're now going to start killing every fucking person that you assume [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1333.9199999999998s)]
*  is is a Muslim migrant is insane. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1338.96s)]

*  Do we just do we forget like crimes are committed by every ethnic group. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1345.6799999999998s)]
*  Okay everyone every single one of them I know that he was he came from a Christian family [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1350.48s)]
*  but who gives a shit. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1355.6s)]
*  My point is even if he was my point is even if he was a fucking Muslim like the notion [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1356.72s)]
*  that the notion that this is like a justifiable act is crazy. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1363.44s)]

*  My issue is is racism like fascism that that breeds off of the racist tribalism in a society [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1368.56s)]
*  that is like deeply deeply disordered. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1379.12s)]
*  It's not even just collective punishment either. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1381.84s)]
*  I mean collective punishment inherently is just bad. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1384.1599999999999s)]
*  It's not appropriate but it's also collective punishment dished out by mob rule. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1387.04s)]
*  That's it. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1393.84s)]

*  we got here. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1417.92s)]

*  was like Ahmed Mohammed and he was directly from Syria the idea that like every single [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1458.8000000000002s)]
*  Syrian refugee or every single person that's like Muslim looking deserves to be like violently [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1463.92s)]

*  Okay like I hope people understand that the Welsh part of the UK brother you mean just [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1474.24s)]

*  That's what it is and a lot of people look to that to be like I'm rationalizing my racist [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1487.04s)]
*  opinions. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1492.4s)]
*  By saying no we have to do that. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1493.92s)]
*  What would you say to convince someone that these movements are completely fascist and [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1496.0s)]
*  based on completely exaggerated information and not a genuine plea for national security. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1499.92s)]
*  What a genuine plea for national security brother they're making the nation insecure [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1504.48s)]
*  like if someone looks to these fucking gamins running around lighting cop fire cop cars [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1509.68s)]

*  fucking mind you know and before people go well what about the Black Lives Matter protest [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1525.28s)]
*  that turned into riots from time to time all around the country it's like yeah okay in [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1529.2s)]
*  that circumstance that is an anti-government protest that is actually understandable and [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1533.52s)]
*  worthy okay that is a protest specifically against the police forces that disproportionately [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1539.44s)]
*  target and kill American citizens in a nation where cops kill more than a thousand people [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1544.72s)]
*  every year they kill ten thousand dogs and other pets every single year okay that's a [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1550.16s)]
*  major issue and yes of course turns out the the enterprise that has the monopoly of violence [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1556.64s)]
*  is not going to simply turn around and go you know what you're right our violent means [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1564.32s)]
*  are too far we're going to stop that. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1569.2s)]
*  No that's not what happens they start beating you and brutalizing you and almost killing you in many [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1572.16s)]
*  instances when you dare to tell the government not to do that okay so once again the age-old [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1578.72s)]
*  Hassan I'd be adage of there are differences between good things and bad things there are [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1586.56s)]
*  differences between good causes and bad causes there's difference between worthy causes and just [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1591.28s)]
*  virile hatred. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1596.0s)]
*  Black Lives Matter protests were not conducted in a similar vein to turn into race riots where [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1597.1999999999998s)]
*  black people were storming the streets looking for white people to kill as a matter of fact it [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1603.52s)]
*  was heavily attended by white people and it was against the police force this on the other hand [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1608.1599999999999s)]
*  is fucking dumbass fascists running around roaming the streets looking for migrants they literally [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1614.1599999999999s)]
*  lit on fire the entrance of a hotel that they knew housed migrants it's fucking insane. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1620.32s)]
*  Outside Downing Street where 100 protesters were arrested in Aldershot large crowd. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1628.0s)]
*  That's the exact argument that these brit people use though yeah it's wrong though that's my whole [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1633.04s)]
*  point Mr would George Floyd be the American parallel or is this different yes there's a [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1637.28s)]
*  difference between an anti-racist protest against objectively a criminal enterprise in American [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1641.76s)]
*  policing versus people being like how about we kill all the migrants and like forcibly remove [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1649.28s)]
*  them from the country and if the government doesn't do it let's take matters into our own hands [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1655.2s)]
*  do you feel like these two things are different do you feel like the the American federal government [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1660.16s)]
*  the north's actions in the in the civil war in the United States of America was the same as Nazi [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1666.24s)]
*  Germany for example they're both governments that were engaging in violent behavior yeah you can [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1672.16s)]
*  reduce everything down to its bare bones and make it seem like they're both same there are [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1677.76s)]
*  they advancing the same project fuck no that's what you have to look at. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1683.84s)]
*  Else gathered outside a hotel house asylum seekers while in Hartlepool private homes were vandalized [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1687.84s)]
*  and a police there are protests burning the world and you're out here winning anti-semite of the [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1693.52s)]
*  year law yeah except those protesters are trying to kill Muslims okay so they would never win [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1696.96s)]
*  anti-semite of the year they would win pro-israel award if there was one to be given out like that [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1703.52s)]
*  disorder peaked over the weekend as riots broke out across the country [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1715.44s)]
*  Sunderland, Middlesbrough, Rovereham all served as staging grounds for some of the most crowded scenes [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1719.68s)]
*  United United United United United United United United United United United United United [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1725.2s)]
*  in Rovereham and Tamworth crowds gathered around hotels housing migrants setting them on fire [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1729.44s)]
*  and breaking in while in Middlesbrough rioters again targeted private homes cars and the crown [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1734.64s)]
*  court that weekend was the most violent and most widespread case of civil unrest in England since [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1741.0400000000002s)]
*  the 2011 riots a much more explosive event in terms of criminal damage injuries and fatalities [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1746.8000000000002s)]
*  sparked by the police killing of Mark Duggan. An event that is now remembered hazily, if at all, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1753.2s)]
*  by a nation that likes to put this kind of unpleasant business behind us. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1759.3600000000001s)]
*  When it is remembered, it's either for the large-scale looting, or more charitably, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1763.44s)]
*  by the liberal press, as a community's collective rage boiling over after years of harsh policing. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1768.24s)]
*  I mean, that's also objectively correct. Like, even the liberal press in that regard, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1774.0s)]
*  that's the way that they analyze it, is notice how the damage conducted in the aftermath of a [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1778.8s)]
*  riot of that regard is to the bottom line of random fucking corporations. Okay? While I [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1784.88s)]
*  understand the reasons as to why people get mad at that, because at the end of that, there are still [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1792.0s)]
*  human beings that might suffer from the financial hardship, especially if it's a small business, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1796.88s)]
*  and I think that that is inappropriate. There is a bit of a difference there, don't you think? [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1801.84s)]
*  In terms of, you know, trying to identify where migrants live to kill them. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1806.08s)]
*  The recently elected government reacted to the riots with a shock and awe crackdown. More than [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1817.36s)]
*  a thousand were arrested at the scene and in the weeks that followed, while local police slapped [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1822.4799999999998s)]
*  together some social media propaganda to show what a good, scary job they were doing. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1827.1999999999998s)]
*  I utterly condemn the far-right thuggery we've seen this weekend. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1831.68s)]
*  The government labeled the rioters as far-right, a designat- [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1836.88s)]
*  Lock them up, mate! What are you fucking doing then? Do your fucking job! Right? Or is it only [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1840.72s)]
*  that you like the star of children, kids star the club of them all, mate? [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1848.16s)]
*  ...that the London media class immediately copied and pasted into their headlines. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1853.68s)]
*  But was this strict- [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1858.56s)]
*  Was this not a far-right viol- Wait, what? [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1859.44s)]
*  ...accurate. National newspapers and government ministers blamed the EDL for the riots, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1861.68s)]
*  a far-right gang of football hooligans that's been inactive for nearly a- [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1866.56s)]
*  Weren't you celebrating when this dumbass, red Tory, won the election? [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1870.16s)]
*  No. I was literally in Croatia doing real-time coverage and all the English heads in the chat [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1873.6s)]
*  were actually kind of mad at me for not actually celebrating it sufficiently. I kept ringing the [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1883.2s)]
*  alarm bells before this program took place. You, you compare them with Mel and Sean, please go back [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1888.96s)]
*  and watch my coverage. Please go back and watch my coverage. I did the exact opposite. I think he [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1894.48s)]
*  heard me joke about me saying Keir Starmer is actually Keir Stalin. And he took it to heart. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1901.2s)]
*  Like he was like, Oh yeah, this is, this guy definitely believes it. Yeah. No, I wasn't fond [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1906.72s)]
*  of Keir Starmer who ran on a platform of we're going to stop the boats and that my opposition [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1911.6s)]
*  is not serious enough about stopping the boats and we're going to do austerity or we're going to [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1917.9199999999998s)]
*  also continue. I did make jokes about Keir Starmer being Stalin, but that's what it was. Jokes. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1923.28s)]
*  Decade. The inconvenient truth is that the riots had no specific organizers. The incredible irony [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1932.24s)]
*  of these riots is that they were largely mobilized by foreign forces themselves. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1939.36s)]
*  The news aggregate site that first spread the false rumors about the South port suspects ethnicity [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1943.6s)]
*  and migration status is based in Pakistan. While the majority of the telegram groups and [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1948.1599999999999s)]
*  influencers responsible for mobilizing people were based abroad, mostly in mainland Europe or the US. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1952.8799999999999s)]
*  So in lieu of domestic organizers, the government cracked down on the shit posters. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1959.1999999999998s)]
*  So I'm actually being arrested. The people on the ground [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1963.6s)]
*  that were primed into defending England. Okay. We're not like random Russian spies. They were [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1968.4s)]
*  just like the dudes that you speak that you see at spoons. Right. Proper, proper reform. My fucking [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1977.76s)]
*  proper reform supporters. All right. This is in relation to some comments that you've made [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1986.88s)]
*  on Facebook page. Your coverage of this one, the UK is following the path of us politics here. This [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=1994.24s)]
*  is not, this is a fan account. This is from daily dose of Hassan. I've been labor leader, sir. Keir [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2000.32s)]
*  Starmer celebrated landslide week through labor winning 170 plus majority. This raises questions [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2003.84s)]
*  about whether the UK labor party will devolve similar to the American democratic party. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2007.68s)]
*  Usually when centers hold power, they shift to the right. I think Hassan is a weak understanding of [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2011.44s)]
*  our politics. I agree. I usually can listen to Hassan stances, but his takes on labor right now [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2015.52s)]
*  are painful clouded by his anglophobia because I was very critical of Keir Starmer. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2020.4s)]
*  The only way that the labor would ever lose this instead of the insane landslide victory that [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2028.0s)]
*  they're supposed to get in this circumstance, like their opposition once again has recycled [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2033.44s)]
*  leadership unceremoniously is this apps this airization. The river is full of the water is bad. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2038.5600000000002s)]
*  Everything's expensive. I mean, it just, it can't go on like this. Right? So the only way that this [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2048.0s)]
*  still loses the clip of your coverage of Keir Starmer's victory. Quick questions. Firstly, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2054.64s)]
*  would you campaign alongside reform for portion representation? Pre-watch piker. You already [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2061.28s)]
*  called it. They're already doing it. Oh yeah. I'm sure you'll see, watch this space in the upcoming [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2065.04s)]
*  days. Everyone is going to talk about how much better Keir Starmer is than Jeremy Corbin. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2071.2000000000003s)]
*  And that centricism won in the UK. And it's the, it's the solution is the antidote to far right [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2075.8399999999997s)]
*  politics of the Tories. Okay. What's happened? I think it was you. You have to excuse things. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2081.2s)]
*  We were saying back then died in the wool. Marks were so briefly lived up. Yeah. It's funny though, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2087.2799999999997s)]
*  because people go, people go, I think you have like this person has me in his fucking PFP. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2092.0s)]
*  I think, Oh no, nevermind. It's actually Keanu Reeves. I thought it was like an old [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2098.0s)]
*  photo of me with long hair, but I thought it was from when I had the long hair and people would [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2101.6s)]
*  make me, people would make jokes about how I look like that fucking Lord Farquaad. You are [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2106.24s)]
*  clueless about UK politics. Please stay out of UK politics. Your understanding is too limited to [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2111.04s)]
*  be speaking from a place of authority. You know, it's funny cause they used to, they said this [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2115.2799999999997s)]
*  about my fucking understanding of American politics too. Now Nigel Farage is more popular [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2119.12s)]
*  than Keir Starmer already. Yeah. Reform is now pulling ahead of labor and some jurisdictions. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2124.48s)]
*  Keir Starmer is so unpopular that reform is going to win seats and they're campaigning on [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2129.76s)]
*  three largest deportation flights in UK history. It's really interesting because most of my analysis [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2134.7200000000003s)]
*  here was about how Keir Starmer is going to be a fucking boring, annoying neoliberal. And he's [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2140.96s)]
*  also uncharismatic and that the real fucking election victory was the, the massive amounts [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2147.36s)]
*  of popularity that reform was able to get in an incredibly fucking short amount of time [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2155.84s)]
*  because of the movement that has gone unaddressed. Okay. And yeah, the post-Corbyn labor party is [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2162.8s)]
*  actually dog shit and they are very similar to the democratic party in America. And it's really [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2170.32s)]
*  interesting because everyone hates the effects of Tori's austerity policies, but the problem is that [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2176.32s)]
*  they have a very sophisticated media behind them. I understand Hassan. I respect Hassan's knowledge [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2180.56s)]
*  on many things, but he doesn't understand UK politics using the US as a country with a complete [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2185.36s)]
*  different political system and culture as some super, as some sort of template is lazy and frankly [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2188.56s)]
*  dumb. I'm not a fan of Biden, but continue to use Jover is pretty cringe labor. Aren't like Tories, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2194.4s)]
*  they're center left, but still have a large contingent of socialist members in a year. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2199.04s)]
*  He will be pressured in the more leftist policies. It hasn't even been that long. It's been four [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2202.88s)]
*  months labor is center left and more left on social issues. Starmer is dull and boring, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2207.44s)]
*  but sounds like heaven after 14 years of clowns and circus acts every PM the Tories had over [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2211.52s)]
*  the 14 years screwed the country in some way, even David Cameron, like nobody was asking for [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2215.2s)]
*  that referendum in the EU or at the time it's nice to have some normalcy back in leadership, [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2219.12s)]
*  some balance and an end to hopefully some for some time of all the extremes and dramas. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2223.3599999999997s)]
*  Only negatives that Farage got to see in the parliament. Maybe it's because of his centrist [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2228.0s)]
*  views that he won. Hmm. Minute 16 of this video, this space, Keir Starmer does privatization [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2231.68s)]
*  continues the, the austerity regime of the Tories. And then basically all the labor strongholds [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2239.28s)]
*  go to reform reform comes in hot as a motherfucker gets more legitimacy from the Tories. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2245.36s)]
*  The Tories have no one else to rely on. So they, they, they try to bring the, the reform party [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2251.76s)]
*  on their side, set up a coalition. And then that only ends up legitimizing the, the reform [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2257.52s)]
*  positions here. Starmer turns around and in a lat like a last ditch effort, he already signaled [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2264.16s)]
*  towards this. He signaled towards us in the debates and he has signaled towards his centrist. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2269.52s)]
*  What will end up happening is Keir Starmer will also capitulate to the right wing framing on [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2274.0s)]
*  immigration. And he already has just like Joe Biden did. Okay. That will only further solidify [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2278.0s)]
*  the reform position and only legitimize reform further England 1930s style, 1930s Germany style [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2283.12s)]
*  England goes right wing next time around. Really in this pincer. The thing is my naysayers make [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2289.76s)]
*  this kind of shit sound sweet. It's not, it's not that insane. It's not like that crazy of a prediction. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2295.92s)]
*  I'm just looking at patterns throughout history and applying the same analysis that I apply [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2302.0s)]
*  usually. And yet, and yet ironically enough, there were still hella people being like, dude, you're [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2309.2000000000003s)]
*  out of your depth. You're out of your element. Will those people turn back and be like, okay, [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2314.88s)]
*  maybe he was right. Probably not. Probably not. Yeah. We're full. Poles who just reform would win [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2320.48s)]
*  Northeast England. Yeah. I had the 14th key dude. Yeah. It's not particularly brilliant. Like these [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2328.7200000000003s)]
*  opinions are not that crazy. I'm just saying North England has always been racist. At least stop [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2334.88s)]
*  the idea that like people are intrinsically racist and unsalvageable is silly. Okay. It's, [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2341.2s)]
*  it's silly. That's a nonsensical silly position. You can't, you can't create winning governing [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2347.04s)]
*  coalitions with that mentality. You can't do anything with that. Oh, yeah. I'll see a Facebook [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2352.7999999999997s)]
*  prime. Is it many of those who were arrested, one even present during the riots, they were charged [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2359.12s)]
*  and handed multi-year sentences for inciting racial hatred or directing the actions of the [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2364.7999999999997s)]
*  riots towards the hotels. They all right. Yeah. Essentially he was telling people on Facebook to [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2369.28s)]
*  go and attack a hotel in Leeds housing asylum seekers. He didn't actually take part in that [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2374.32s)]
*  action. We understand he was at home with an injured foot, but it was his messages online that [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2379.92s)]
*  were seen by his friends and other people. They shared those posts with every man and his dog. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2384.88s)]
*  She smashed a fuck out of Britannia hotel in Leeds that were at the root of his sentencing. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2390.32s)]
*  The sentence that I pass has been reduced by one third to reflect your guilty plea. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2397.2s)]
*  The sentence is one of 20 months imprisonment. Martin Luther King said that a riot. What is this? [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2402.8799999999997s)]
*  Rev up your judgment by my enemy's tweet. Another Hassan hater got exposed for pulling a V. Who, [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2408.08s)]
*  who did? The language of the unheard, a quote that is inconsistently applied by liberal commentators. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2412.72s)]
*  Happy to roll it out for causes we sympathize with and ain't no fucking way. Ain't no fucking way. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2419.3599999999997s)]
*  That this man is using an MLK quote to, to talk about what the fuck to talk about a fucking [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2427.6s)]
*  pogrom. What is happening? First, he said it was actually not the proper British gamins. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2436.3199999999997s)]
*  Muda. Wait, what did Muda do? Oh no. Is he in the lolly? Shut the fuck up. Ain't no fucking way. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2442.08s)]
*  Ain't no fucking way that Muda is in the lolly shit. Muda is a lolly enjoyer. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2449.6s)]
*  No, I don't believe that. That sounds fucking nuts. Wait, why is his account locked? Why is [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2456.64s)]
*  his account inactive preventing impersonation? Wait, what? Wait, what resurface video of Oompa [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2463.2s)]
*  Ville, some ordinary gamers and nukes taco watching lolly porn together on a discord call. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2470.16s)]
*  Can't speak for Caleb from what I remember regarding stuff like this is stuff from Nuck [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2475.7599999999998s)]
*  showing us hentai for his competitions. And usually in this, there are around multiple creators. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2478.96s)]
*  No defense here. I'm not knowledgeable about anything anime and I finally assumed someone [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2484.96s)]
*  we collaborate at the time showed us hentai and nothing illegal. This is appears to now [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2488.0s)]
*  come from some something more sinister. I apologize for what I said in this. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2491.92s)]
*  And I'm livid at Nuck's who was quite against this kind of material in both public and private [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2495.76s)]
*  conversations with us. Whatever he showed us at the time I had believed would just fall under [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2499.04s)]
*  legal hentai banner in Canada and the U S and assume poorly that all of it would just be legal. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2503.44s)]
*  And after filming, just go on with my day. Check out the Nuck's YouTube video channel. He's made [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2507.76s)]
*  several anti-Assam vids. Nux is Nux hates you. He's super pro Israel. Yeah. Let's not dive into [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2512.64s)]
*  that somber pit of hell, please. Yeah. I mean, this doesn't seem like it's a, it's entirely a [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2518.72s)]
*  mood of Horace fault. Now in a situation in an, if there was ever like a comparable situation where [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2525.12s)]
*  I was in the crosshairs in a similar vein, I'm sure he would farm that fucking sweet, sweet fuck [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2532.16s)]
*  has some points aggressively and in the most sinister fashion possible. I will not be doing [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2536.8799999999997s)]
*  that to him. I don't think that he, I mean, he was friends with that one fucking guy Nux. He's the V [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2541.84s)]
*  he's the, he's the guy with a V tube avatar, right? That like definitely is into some weird shit. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2548.6400000000003s)]
*  But, you know, I won't do that to him. I don't think that this is a, as damning for mood of [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2553.6000000000004s)]
*  horror. I don't know what the fucking video is. I don't know what he says in the video, but, [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2560.32s)]
*  and I like Oompa Ville in general. I haven't seen anything gross or weird from him. So yeah, [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2564.2400000000002s)]
*  I'll be on a discord call to watch hentai as well though. Yeah, no, I know it's gross. It's weird, [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2569.36s)]
*  but I don't, I don't think that mood of horror is like a fucking lolly enjoyer personally, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2573.36s)]
*  or at least that is not the damning evidence that you think it is. Once again, though, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2580.2400000000002s)]
*  I will repeat mood horror, especially runs was a foot runs a very weird crowd. And not only does [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2585.6800000000003s)]
*  he run with a very weird fucking crowd, he has time and time again, tucked on the fuck has on [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2591.44s)]
*  heartstrings over and over again with all the other weirdos that he aligns with and, and has [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2598.16s)]
*  actively played a role in the, has actively played a role in the, the, we should get a Twitch band [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2605.6s)]
*  or we should get Hassan D platform train extra weird considering that he, you know, went to the [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2613.6s)]
*  Hodge, did the Hodge, went to the Mecca. And not only that, but also, you know, the fan base that [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2619.76s)]
*  he's trying to cultivate desperately dehumanizes him, or at least the people that he aligns with [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2627.76s)]
*  legitimately fucking hate Muslims, like actually despises Muslims and brown people. So kind of odd, [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2633.28s)]
*  but you know, you gotta do what you gotta do. Rarely for those we oppose. Understandably as well, [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2640.96s)]
*  as the hate that was on display makes these writers incredibly difficult to sympathize with [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2646.88s)]
*  while they're outright idiocy makes us feel like their motivations are too stupid to bother [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2651.28s)]
*  analyzing. But failing to assess the reasoning behind these riots will leave us open to being [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2655.92s)]
*  surprised when they happen again. The way I see it, there were two riots this summer, the one that [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2662.32s)]
*  happened on the ground and the one that happened online. On the ground, I think it's simple enough. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2667.6800000000003s)]
*  It's not a coincidence that seven out of the 10 most deprived areas in the UK were home to riots. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2674.0s)]
*  Well, okay. The way to cover this is not by fucking undermining the severity of the racist pogroms. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2679.04s)]
*  Yeah. Mota has talked about Gaza twice, both about Hassan. Yeah. All those fucking, all of those [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2686.48s)]

*  talked about it because they were too afraid of pissing off people. And the only time they [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2699.28s)]
*  ever talked about it was to attack a motherfucker who actually is, is, you know, brave enough to [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2704.32s)]
*  put himself out there with their actual positions. I have no respect for shameful centrist drama [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2709.92s)]
*  farming. Always center, right? Always reactionary pieces of shit. Okay. No respect whatsoever. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2717.6000000000004s)]

*  fucking guys, all of these guys, what is this? Nicholas de Oreo or whatever. The Oreo guy, [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2742.6400000000003s)]

*  seemingly talk about anything Israel, Palestine adjacent is when they fucking turn around, [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2765.92s)]

*  Muda's deep dives into niche IT topics is informative, but after what he's been doing [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2925.44s)]
*  for the past year, I lost every single iota of respect for him and on self. Fuck this coward. Oh, [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2928.64s)]
*  no, I used to talk to him. I used to talk to Muda. Like I, we use a DM back and forth. I thought it [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2932.16s)]
*  was chill. Like I would ask him for advice on fucking Steam Deck related shit. Like I'm not [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2938.56s)]
*  expecting him to, to be, you know, to, to avoid talking about me for that reason. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2944.16s)]
*  Okay. That's not what my expectation is at all, but I would have thought that he would be at least [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2950.8799999999997s)]
*  somewhat charitable and, and more understanding or even fucking reach out to be like, Hey, I've been [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2955.3599999999997s)]
*  hearing a lot of stuff that people are saying about you. I wonder if it's true because I feel like [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2962.3999999999996s)]
*  that at that point is not even friendship that at that point is just like doing your [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2970.32s)]
*  goddamn journalistic due diligence. If you're going to fucking write a YouTube essay, that was [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2974.0s)]
*  what I was trying to reference when a chatters were saying that Muda is, it was caught in a [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2977.76s)]
*  resurface video watching Lolly con porn of, of drawn children. That shared ability that I offered [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2982.6400000000003s)]
*  in my analysis is not because I'm friends with him. I clearly am not. Okay. It's because I'm not a [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2990.6400000000003s)]
*  fucking asshole. Muda is a large content creator. It'd be fucking super easy for me to just like [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=2997.76s)]
*  make a YouTube video dedicated to exposing him and demanding accountability. Okay. And I'm sure [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=3004.0s)]
*  there are plenty of people who fucking hate him as well. And they would also get on board with that. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=3010.48s)]
*  That's usually how it works. That's usually how these fucking dipshits make YouTube videos. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=3015.28s)]
*  The reason why I'm not doing that. And the reason why I don't care to do that is because I don't [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=3019.76s)]
*  think that there's enough evidence for him to, you know, to be called a Lolly porn enjoyer. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=3024.24s)]
*  He simply was, it seems friends with one. I don't even know if he's still friends with them, but [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=3030.56s)]
*  regardless, the former leader of the EDL, Tommy Robinson has rebranded himself as a citizen [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=3035.4399999999996s)]
*  journalist, reaching a worldwide audience. Now through Twitter and podcast appearances, [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=3041.6s)]
*  based getting onto the fact that there's been riots in the U. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=3047.2s)]
*  This guy is literally a white supremacist terrorist, by the way, the fact that like the [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=3050.0s)]
*  daily wire is offering him a platform is of course the most expected outcome, but like they're making [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=3054.88s)]
*  it seem like he's just like a normal dude. He's just a straight up fucking Nazi. Yeah. If you were [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=3060.8s)]

*  No, we got to do a little bit of plausible deniability. When you, when you say that sort [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=3070.64s)]
*  of stuff, you gotta, you gotta be like, Oh, I don't know. I don't know. But it's like pretty crazy, [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=3075.68s)]
*  pretty damning. That's how they do it. Okay. And the media have said that I instigated them [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=3081.44s)]
*  and directed them. Tommy and the influences in his sphere are seasoned enough not to post anything [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=3086.56s)]
*  that could be seen as incitement during the riots, leaving that to their followers, ordinary people [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=3091.7599999999998s)]
*  who the government then turns into martyrs when they hand out these lengthy prison sentences for [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=3098.16s)]
*  online speech. Since COVID-19, the internet has become a more hostile and openly conspiratorial [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=3102.8s)]
*  place. And my hunch is that England generally is following suit. But to confirm my suspicions, [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=3109.04s)]
*  I went to the one place where you can always get a reliable measure of how the English really feel. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=3115.28s)]
*  The pub. If you are not English and you are watching this and you want to know the best way [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=3120.4s)]
*  to integrate yourself with English culture quickly, the moment you get off the plane or small boat or [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=3125.6000000000004s)]
*  whatever, you want to get yourself down to a Weatherspoons, get a full English breakfast, [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=3132.08s)]
*  and order a pint of the cheapest lager possible. Only in England and only in Weatherspoons, [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=3136.24s)]
*  the biggest chain of pubs in the UK and the nation's public living room. Weatherspoons is [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=3141.7599999999998s)]
*  a national institution. Hell, it's basically a public service. There aren't many places today [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=3146.96s)]
*  where you can get a pint in a full English for five pounds. In a country plagued by inflation [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=3151.36s)]
*  and over a decade of stagnant wages, it is an oasis of the cheap and unchanging. Are you proud [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=3155.36s)]
*  to be English? That's an interesting question because I'm not too sure. So I think the idea [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=3160.4s)]
*  was a bit square. England has always been a mixed race country. Are you proud to be English? Very [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=3165.84s)]
*  proud. Why? It's where I was born, where I was brought up, English through and through. I think [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=3173.84s)]
*  English should come first. I don't mind anybody coming to this country if they're legal. If they [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=3180.0s)]
*  work and pay taxes and everything, I'm fine with it. But they come in on the boat, they're giving [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=3186.24s)]
*  hotels, food, lodging, and money. So they're getting everything for nothing. And they even get [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=3192.4799999999996s)]
*  to come on the waiting list before English people. So when you're just a race, I'll excuse you. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=3201.04s)]
*  Yeah. It's like these people that are coming from war torn parts of the fucking world [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=3207.52s)]
*  actually have it so much better. They have it so much better than the average lad. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=3213.84s)]
*  You know, it's the same fucking talking points. That's why it's so funny when people are like [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=3217.84s)]
*  Hassan, you can't interpret what's going on in the UK by talking about, by, by making a comparison [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=3221.44s)]
*  to America. It's hollow. Also, I read somewhere on the, on the Reddit that Mouda Har actually [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=3229.6s)]
*  basically nuked his whole account and is keeping it inactive, preventing impersonation, [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=3236.16s)]
*  exclusively because Twitter got two races for him. It's like dog. You literally court racist [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=3242.56s)]
*  for the record. Like, what do you mean? Excuse me. I am [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvD1c9toK0&t=3248.96s)]
