# Trump’s Most UNHINGED Speech Yet | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [April 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y)
*  I brought a hat just in case it got too windy, but here's... [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Would anybody like a hat? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3.0s)]
*  I'm giving it... I'm not giving it to a cabinet. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=5.0s)]
*  I'm giving it to the autoworkers. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=7.0s)]
*  I caught it! I caught it, Mr. President! [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=9.0s)]
*  Thank you, fellas. Get it. That's it. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=14.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=17.0s)]
*  Hell yeah! [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=19.0s)]
*  They deserve it more than our cabinet. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=21.0s)]
*  Make the tree rot scream, Mr. President! [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=23.0s)]
*  Our cabinet has plenty of hats. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=25.0s)]
*  ...buying ahead of that announcement from Trump... [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=31.0s)]
*  I wish the Democrats... [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=35.0s)]
*  ...and the market's still looking for clarity... [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=36.0s)]
*  ...like a real... [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=37.0s)]
*  ...we know the stock... [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=38.0s)]
*  Democrats motivated by a real leftist ideology, an anti-capitalist ideology, would be half as successful as Donald Trump in the future. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=39.0s)]
*  It makes me so sad. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=49.0s)]
*  ...the day of negotiating tactic, and that he would not allow them to have a severe drag on the economy, that if he were to see that happening, he would start to pull... [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=50.0s)]
*  Those are a lot of ifs out there right now, Kara, Kana. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=60.0s)]
*  So what we're seeing is people are betting that clarity will bring stability to the market, but we're not sure because we still have those retaliatory tariffs. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=64.0s)]
*  Remember, these countries are going to have to answer back to whatever Trump puts out there today. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=72.0s)]
*  We don't know what that's going to mean for corporate profits, what that's going to mean for the health of industries here in the U.S. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=78.0s)]
*  Right, we're seeing some overseas markets. It looks like they're coming together. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=84.0s)]
*  We've heard from Mexico's president saying she doesn't want to do a tit for tat, but you're right. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=88.0s)]
*  We don't really know how these other countries are going to retaliate. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=93.0s)]
*  As you're watching the video here, again, we are awaiting the announcement from the president, and you can see everyone is gathered there in the Rose Garden. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=96.0s)]
*  But Alexis, I think we just saw JD Vance... [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=102.0s)]
*  Oh, there he is. There's JD Vance shaking hands, glad handing some folks that are clearly there in support of the president. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=104.0s)]
*  Alexis, can I ask you one other quick question here? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=110.0s)]
*  There was some terminology that came across my desk today. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=112.0s)]
*  Some investigators, excuse me, some investors consider what's happening right now in the market a bit of a clearing event. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=115.0s)]
*  Can you explain that? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=121.0s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely, Kana. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=124.0s)]
*  So what happens is stocks are down so much. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=127.0s)]
*  I mean, just take a look at this. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=130.0s)]
*  The S&P 500 tied to lots of people's retirement funds, down 8% from the record high we saw back in February. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=132.0s)]
*  The Nasdaq, which is home to many big tech companies like Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, down 14% since the high we saw back in February. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=139.0s)]
*  When you have stocks that have been so richly valued come down so fast, it's just too good of an opportunity for a lot of institutional investors and just regular investors to pass up. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=149.0s)]
*  So we're sort of seeing this clearing in the market right now where they're sort of deciphering who may be the winners, if at all, from these tariffs. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=159.0s)]
*  For Wall Street, from where they stand, a more targeted approach from the president would be the way to go because the pain would presumably be less spread out. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=167.0s)]
*  It wouldn't affect all parts of our economy. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=176.0s)]
*  So a lot depends on what we're going to hear in the next few minutes. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=179.0s)]
*  But at least for today, investors felt that safe to come back into the market at these levels ahead of that announcement. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=182.0s)]
*  Interesting. All right, Alexis, thank you. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=189.0s)]
*  Thank you. And, Katherine, as we're watching all of this play out here, we know that the president was meeting with his advisors, his so-called tariff team, if you will. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=192.0s)]
*  And because we're so sparse on details, there was some reporting that even his closest advisor didn't know the specifics of this. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=200.0s)]
*  But, Katherine, in this moment leading up, I mean, who really has the president's ear right now? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=206.0s)]
*  Well, it's a good question because, as you know, there's multiple different advisors who Trump has been consulting on the tariffs. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=210.0s)]
*  Sorry, because we're going to send it to David Meir and the powerhouse political team, powerhouse political team for special coverage here. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=218.0s)]
*  Good afternoon, everyone. We're coming on the air for what will likely be another defining moment in President Trump's second term. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=225.0s)]
*  Just moments from now, the president is expecting to unveil his sweeping tariff plan, which has been raising economic anxiety here in the U.S. and around the world. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=230.0s)]
*  You can see the president right there emerging in the Rose Garden in what's designed today to be a major event at the White House. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=237.0s)]
*  The president is expected to unveil these new tariffs targeting many of America's trade partners. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=242.0s)]
*  The president's cabinet and Republican leaders are attending the event right there in the Rose Garden. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=247.0s)]
*  The White House has said the new tariffs will take effect immediately. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=251.0s)]
*  The administration has given no real indication about the scope of the tariffs before this moment, percentages or the countries being targeted. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=254.0s)]
*  Just this morning, a senior administration official telling ABC News, quote, it's still all very fluid. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=261.0s)]
*  It's believed to be an aggressive plan here, which will include tariffs on some of America's closest allies. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=266.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. Let's listen to the president. Thank you. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=271.0s)]
*  Nice crowd. What a good looking group of people. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=274.0s)]
*  Well, we have some very, very good news today and a lot of good things are happening for our country. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=276.0s)]
*  Please sit down. My fellow Americans, this is Liberation Day. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=282.0s)]
*  Waiting for a long time. April 2nd, 2025 will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=289.0s)]
*  The day America's destiny was reclaimed and the day that we began to make America wealthy again. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=300.0s)]
*  Gonna make it wealthy, good and wealthy. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=309.0s)]
*  For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, robbed and plundered by nations near and far. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=312.0s)]
*  I want one of those like Gryper core videos of Trump talking about how he's going to there's going to be so much winning. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=319.0s)]
*  You will say, please, sir, not not enough winning is like and then like HVAC business owners like crying. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=326.0s)]
*  Years of ransacked our factories and foreign scavengers have torn apart our once beautiful American dream. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=333.0s)]
*  We had an American dream that you don't hear so much about. You did four years ago. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=341.0s)]
*  You don't hear about it any longer. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=345.0s)]
*  But where is it too often for many years? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=347.0s)]
*  For many years, a decade. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=349.0s)]
*  They say, hold on. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=351.0s)]
*  Let's see what as Ms. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=352.0s)]
*  Chad, our country and its taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, but it is not going to happen anymore. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=353.0s)]
*  It's not going to happen. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=361.0s)]
*  Based Trump pump, a theory. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=362.0s)]
*  And please, in a few moments, I will sign a historic executive order. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=364.0s)]
*  Yes, daddy, daddy, no, reciprocal tariffs on countries throughout the world. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=369.0s)]
*  Reciprocal. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=374.0s)]
*  That means they do it to us and we do it to them. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=375.0s)]
*  Very simple. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=378.0s)]
*  Can't get any simpler than that. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=379.0s)]
*  This is one of the most important days, my opinion in American history. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=384.0s)]
*  It's our declaration of economic independence for years. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=390.0s)]
*  Hardworking American citizens were forced to sit on the sidelines as other nations got rich and powerful. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=395.0s)]
*  Much of it. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=401.0s)]
*  But now it's our turn to prosper. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=402.0s)]
*  And in so doing, use trillions and trillions of dollars to reduce our taxes and pay down our national debt. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=405.0s)]
*  And it'll all happen very quickly. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=412.0s)]
*  With today's action, we are finally going to be able to make America great again, greater than ever before. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=415.0s)]
*  Jobs and factories will come roaring back into our country. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=422.0s)]
*  And you see it happening already. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=427.0s)]
*  We will supercharge our domestic industrial base. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=429.0s)]
*  We will pry open foreign markets and break down foreign trade barriers. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=433.0s)]
*  And ultimately, more production at home will mean stronger competition and lower prices for consumers. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=438.0s)]
*  This will be indeed the golden age of the world. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=444.0s)]
*  This will be indeed the golden age of Americans coming back. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=449.0s)]
*  We're going to come back very strongly. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=454.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, the golden age is upon us. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=459.0s)]
*  We're pleased to be joined on this momentous occasion by Vice President J.D. Vance. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=461.0s)]
*  J.D., thank you. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=466.0s)]
*  They're all, they believe it. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=468.0s)]
*  They're saying, hell yeah. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=470.0s)]
*  That wasn't too hard to find. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=472.0s)]
*  I was looking, you know, he likes to take a low key attitude. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=474.0s)]
*  Usually we sit right in front. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=477.0s)]
*  He's gaining a lot of confidence. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=479.0s)]
*  And nearly my entire cabinet is here as well as Speaker Mike Johnson, who's done an amazing job. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=481.0s)]
*  And with the great success we had last night in Florida, we have a majority of seven and sevens like a lot where we had it at one. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=492.0s)]
*  Right. You've done a fantastic job. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=501.0s)]
*  And many of the members of the Macy's that have his chat is European, which makes it even funnier. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=503.0s)]
*  I know they get the worst out of this as well. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=508.0s)]
*  The United States last year, like European Gropers loving Donald Trump's initiatives is so funny to me. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=511.0s)]
*  It just like destroys their economy. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=517.0s)]
*  Outrageous non-monetary barriers to decimate our industries. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=520.0s)]
*  And in many cases, the non-monetary barriers were worse than the monetary ones. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=525.0s)]
*  They manipulated their currencies, subsidized their exports, stole our intellectual. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=530.0s)]
*  Where's Elon? Where's Elon? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=535.0s)]
*  Imposed exorbitant VAT taxes to disadvantage our products, adopted unfair rules and technical standards and created filthy pollution havens. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=537.0s)]
*  They were absolutely filthy, but they always came to us and they said we're violating. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=547.0s)]
*  We should pay for it. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=553.0s)]
*  It's all detailed in a very big report by the US trade representative on foreign trade barriers. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=554.0s)]
*  And I'll just hold it up for you. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=561.0s)]
*  It's available and you don't have to pay too much. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=563.0s)]
*  As I understand it, you'll pay nothing. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=566.0s)]
*  It's a lot of work, a lot of work for something actually, because it's a special it's a special book. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=568.0s)]
*  It's very frankly, it's very upsetting when you read it, when you see what people have been doing to us for 30 years. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=574.0s)]
*  This all happened with no response from the United States of America, none whatsoever. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=582.0s)]
*  But those days are over. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=587.0s)]
*  Let me offer just a few examples of the vicious attacks workers have faced for so many years. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=589.0s)]
*  The United States charges other countries only a 2.4 tariff on motorcycles. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=596.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, Thailand and Ireland are charging much higher prices like 60 percent is 70 percent. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=603.0s)]
*  Vietnam charges 75 percent and others are even higher than that. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=610.0s)]
*  Likewise, until today, the United States has for decades charged a 2.5 tariff. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=615.0s)]
*  Think of that 2.5 percent on foreign made automobiles. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=622.0s)]
*  The European Union charges us more than 10 percent tariffs and they have 20 percent VATS, much, much higher. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=627.0s)]
*  India charges 70 percent or perhaps worst of all are the non-monetary restrictions imposed by South Korea, Japan and very many other nations. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=636.0s)]
*  As a result of these colossal trade barriers, 81 percent of the cars in South Korea are made in South Korea. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=645.0s)]
*  Ninety four percent of the cars in Japan are made in Japan. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=654.0s)]
*  Toyota sells one million foreign made automobiles into the United States and General Motors sells almost none. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=658.0s)]
*  Ford sells very little. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=666.0s)]
*  None of our companies are allowed to go into other countries. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=668.0s)]
*  And I say that friend and foe. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=672.0s)]
*  And in many cases, the friend is worse than the foe in terms of trade. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=674.0s)]
*  But such horrendous imbalances have devastated our industrial base and put our national security at risk. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=679.0s)]
*  I don't blame these other countries at all for this calamity. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=686.0s)]
*  I blame former presidents and past leaders who weren't doing their job. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=690.0s)]
*  They let it happen. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=694.0s)]
*  And they let it happen to an extent that nobody can even believe. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=695.0s)]
*  Imagine supporting and believing this idiot. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=698.0s)]
*  We will impose a 25 percent tariff on all foreign made automobiles. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=700.0s)]
*  Our words in the chat don't understand how economics work. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=705.0s)]
*  Omega law. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=707.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=708.0s)]
*  But tariffs and VAT are paid by the end consumer. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=709.0s)]
*  What is happening? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=712.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=713.0s)]
*  I just see him sitting. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=714.0s)]
*  He's been a fan of ours. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=715.0s)]
*  And he understands this business a lot better than the economists, a lot better than anybody. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=718.0s)]
*  Brian, say a few words, please. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=723.0s)]
*  Would you? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=724.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=725.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=726.0s)]
*  It's great honor to have you. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=727.0s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=728.0s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=729.0s)]
*  I grew up just north of Detroit, Michigan, in Macomb County, known as the home of the Reagan Democrats. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=730.0s)]
*  My first vote for president was Ronald Reagan. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=736.0s)]
*  I thought that was going to be the best president I ever saw in my lifetime. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=739.0s)]
*  Until Donald J. Trump came along. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=742.0s)]
*  You're a fucking idiot. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=744.0s)]
*  You can wear all the labor unions shit all you want. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=746.0s)]
*  You voted for Ronald Reagan, you dumb fuck. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=748.0s)]
*  Plant after plant after plant in Detroit and in the metro Detroit area closed. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=750.0s)]
*  There are now plants sitting idle. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=756.0s)]
*  There are now plants that are underutilized. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=758.0s)]
*  And Donald Trump's policies are going to bring product back into those underutilized plants. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=761.0s)]
*  These people are so stupid. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=767.0s)]
*  There's going to be new investment. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=768.0s)]
*  There's going to be new plants built. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=769.0s)]
*  And the UAW members, and I brought 20 of them with me. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=771.0s)]
*  They're sitting right over here. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=774.0s)]
*  We support Donald Trump's policies on tariffs. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=776.0s)]
*  100 percent. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=780.0s)]
*  So, Mr. President, we can't thank you enough. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=782.0s)]
*  And in six months or a year, we're going to begin to see the benefits. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=785.0s)]
*  I can't wait to see what's happening three or four years down the road. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=788.0s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=791.0s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=793.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=795.0s)]
*  What a great guy. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=796.0s)]
*  He got it right from the beginning. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=797.0s)]
*  He got it before almost anybody else's group over there. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=799.0s)]
*  They got it too. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=802.0s)]
*  As far as as far as tariffs and boosting American manufacturing goes, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=803.0s)]
*  there is a validity for UAW to be in support of some of these tariffs. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=808.0s)]
*  OK, but saying like, oh, I love Ronald Reagan. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=812.0s)]
*  Like you're a fucking moron. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=815.0s)]
*  OK, you're a moron. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=817.0s)]
*  Pretty good. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=818.0s)]
*  I will tell you. Thank you very much. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=819.0s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=820.0s)]
*  You're going to be very happy. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=821.0s)]
*  His position is I don't think Sean Fain said he loves Ronald Reagan. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=823.0s)]
*  I think you're talking about Sean O'Brien who said that and he was wrong to say [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=826.0s)]
*  that I don't think Sean Fain was like, I love Ronald Reagan. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=829.0s)]
*  Are you insane? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=833.0s)]
*  Day in day out. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=834.0s)]
*  You're seeing it. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=835.0s)]
*  Nobody's ever seen anything like that with today's actions. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=836.0s)]
*  We're also standing up for our great farmers and ranchers. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=839.0s)]
*  UAW's position on the tariffs are that it will be beneficial for American [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=842.0s)]
*  manufacturing. Yes. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=846.0s)]
*  Canada, by the way, imposes a two hundred and fifty to three hundred percent [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=849.0s)]
*  tariff on many of our dairy products. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=854.0s)]
*  They do the first the first can of milk. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=856.0s)]
*  They do the first little carton of milk at a very low price. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=860.0s)]
*  But after that, it gets bad and then it gets up to two hundred and seventy five [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=863.0s)]
*  three hundred percent. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=867.0s)]
*  So when they're figuring what's Canada charging, they say, oh, about two percent [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=868.0s)]
*  percent. But take a look at what happens down the road. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=872.0s)]
*  When you look a little bit, it's not a pretty picture and we don't like it. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=875.0s)]
*  And it's not fair. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=879.0s)]
*  It's not fair to our farmers. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=880.0s)]
*  It's not fair to our country. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=881.0s)]
*  And with countries like Canada, you know, we subsidize a lot of countries and [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=882.0s)]
*  keep them going and keep them in business. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=887.0s)]
*  In the case of Mexico, it's three hundred billion dollars a year. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=890.0s)]
*  In the case of Canada, it's close to two hundred billion dollars a year. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=894.0s)]
*  And I say, why are we doing this? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=898.0s)]
*  Why are we doing this? [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=900.0s)]
*  I mean, at what point do we say you got to work for yourselves and you got it? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=901.0s)]
*  This is why we have the big deficits. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=906.0s)]
*  This is why we have that amount of debt that's been placed on our heads over the [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=909.0s)]
*  last number of years. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=914.0s)]
*  And we're really not taking it anymore through non tariff barriers. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=916.0s)]
*  The European Union bans imports of most American poultry. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=920.0s)]
*  You understand they say we want to send you our cars. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=924.0s)]
*  We want to send you everything, but we're not going to take anything that you [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=927.0s)]
*  have. Australia bans and they're wonderful people and wonderful everything. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=931.0s)]
*  But they ban American beef. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=936.0s)]
*  Yet we imported three billion dollars of Australian beef from them just last [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=938.0s)]
*  year alone. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=943.0s)]
*  They won't take any of our beef. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=944.0s)]
*  They don't want it because they don't want it to affect their farmers. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=945.0s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=948.0s)]
*  I don't blame them. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=949.0s)]
*  But we're doing the same thing right now, starting about midnight tonight, I [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=950.0s)]
*  would say. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=954.0s)]
*  And China charges American rice farmers an over quota. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=959.0s)]
*  It's called a tariff rate of 65 percent. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=962.0s)]
*  South Korea charges 50. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=965.0s)]
*  Actually, they charge different from 50 percent to five hundred and thirteen [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=968.0s)]
*  percent. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=972.0s)]
*  And Japan, our friend, charges a seven hundred percent. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=973.0s)]
*  But that's because they don't want us selling rice. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=977.0s)]
*  Another thing. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=979.0s)]
*  Who can blame them? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=980.0s)]
*  Madam Secretary, agriculture. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=982.0s)]
*  Great job you did on eggs, by the way. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=984.0s)]
*  The egg prices came down 50 percent. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=986.0s)]
*  You got them down 50 percent. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=989.0s)]
*  Once we got involved, they were going through the sky, the egg prices. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=991.0s)]
*  They were going through the sky and you did a fantastic job. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=995.0s)]
*  Now we have lots of eggs and they're much cheaper down about 59 percent now. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=998.0s)]
*  And they're going down further. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1003.0s)]
*  We charge two point eight percent for so many things that other countries are [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1005.0s)]
*  charging. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1010.0s)]
*  Ten percent across the board tariff on all imports. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1011.0s)]
*  And China would be the first on line. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1013.0s)]
*  They run a very strong country. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1015.0s)]
*  But they're not first in line and the American people are paying a very big [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1017.0s)]
*  price. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1022.0s)]
*  From 1789 to 1913, we were a tariff backed nation in the United States. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1023.0s)]
*  And we were the first country to have a tariff back. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1030.0s)]
*  And we were the first country to have a tariff back. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1033.0s)]
*  And we were the first country to have a tariff back. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1036.0s)]
*  In 1913, we were a tariff backed nation and the United States was [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1039.0s)]
*  proportionately the wealthiest it has ever been. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1044.0s)]
*  So wealthy, in fact, that in the 1880s, they established a commission to decide [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1047.0s)]
*  what they were going to do with the vast sums of money they were collecting. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1053.0s)]
*  We were collecting so much money so fast we didn't know what to do with it. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1057.0s)]
*  Isn't that a nice problem to have? [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1060.0s)]
*  What do you think, Marco? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1062.0s)]
*  Good problem? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1063.0s)]
*  Marco would love that problem. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1064.0s)]
*  But we don't have that problem. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1066.0s)]
*  I don't think he meant 1789. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1068.0s)]
*  They collected so much money, they actually formed a commission to determine [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1070.0s)]
*  what they were going to do with the money, who they were going to give it to [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1074.0s)]
*  and how much. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1077.0s)]
*  Then in 1913, for reasons unknown to mankind, they established the income tax [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1078.0s)]
*  so that citizens rather than foreign countries would start paying the money [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1084.0s)]
*  necessary to run our government. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1088.0s)]
*  And in 1929, it all came to a very abrupt end with the Great Depression. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1090.0s)]
*  And it would have never happened if they had stayed with the tariff policy. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1095.0s)]
*  Oh, that's what Goss did. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1099.0s)]
*  They tried to bring back tariffs to save our country, but it was gone. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1102.0s)]
*  It was gone. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1107.0s)]
*  It was too late. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1108.0s)]
*  Nothing could have been done. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1109.0s)]
*  It took years and years to get out of that depression, far longer than even that [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1110.0s)]
*  office right over there for a long period of time. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1115.0s)]
*  The ramp system that's rather intricate was built because of him. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1118.0s)]
*  And every time you walk up, you think of him and he did a great job in many ways, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1122.0s)]
*  but it lasted long beyond his terms, as you know. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1127.0s)]
*  But it's not too late any longer. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1131.0s)]
*  And we're going to start being smart and we're going to start being very wealthy again. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1133.0s)]
*  We're going to be wealthy as a country because they've taken so much of our wealth away from us. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1138.0s)]
*  We're not going to let that happen. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1143.0s)]
*  We truly can be very wealthy. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1145.0s)]
*  We can be so much wealthier than any country. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1146.0s)]
*  It's not even believable. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1149.0s)]
*  But we're getting smart. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1150.0s)]
*  Nearly a century later, in the face of unrelenting economic warfare, the United States can no longer [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1152.0s)]
*  continue with a policy of unilateral economic surrender. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1158.0s)]
*  We cannot pay the deficits of Canada, Mexico, and so many other countries. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1162.0s)]
*  We used to do it. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1166.0s)]
*  We can't do it anymore. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1167.0s)]
*  We take care of countries all over the world. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1168.0s)]
*  We pay for their military. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1171.0s)]
*  We pay for everything they have to pay. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1172.0s)]
*  And then when you want to cut back a little bit, they get upset that you're not taking care of [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1175.0s)]
*  them any longer. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1179.0s)]
*  But we have to take care of our people and we're going to take care of our people first. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1180.0s)]
*  And I'm sorry to say that. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1184.0s)]
*  And today we're standing up for the American worker and we are finally putting America first. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1190.0s)]
*  In sleepy Joe Biden's last year in office, the United States hemorrhaged 100,000 manufacturing [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1197.0s)]
*  jobs and the number was going through the roof at levels never seen before. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1209.0s)]
*  And our trade deficit reached a record one point two trillion dollars, which is unheard of. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1214.0s)]
*  Since the beginning of NAFTA, the worst trade deal ever made. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1221.0s)]
*  It was a horror show. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1225.0s)]
*  I was able to terminate it. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1226.0s)]
*  They all said you'd never be able to get it out. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1227.0s)]
*  We had to get approval from Congress to get it terminated. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1230.0s)]
*  We had to live with that deal. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1234.0s)]
*  It was the worst deal, worst trade deal ever made by far. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1235.0s)]
*  But since the very beginning of NAFTA, our country lost 90,000 factories. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1238.0s)]
*  Think of what that is. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1244.0s)]
*  Ninety thousand. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1246.0s)]
*  Think about putting a map up. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1247.0s)]
*  Does he announce the income tax to be abolished? [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1248.0s)]
*  You wouldn't have enough room. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1249.0s)]
*  I mean, he did say it was bad. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1250.0s)]
*  Ninety thousand. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1251.0s)]
*  I said, is that possible? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1252.0s)]
*  We had it checked four different times and it was actually somewhat higher than that. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1253.0s)]
*  And five million manufacturing jobs were lost while racking up trade deficits of 19 trillion dollars. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1258.0s)]
*  That was the worst trade deal ever made. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1266.0s)]
*  As a result of these gigantic losses, foreign nations now own 26 trillion dollars more of [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1269.0s)]
*  American assets than American. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1275.0s)]
*  Think of this than the Americans own of their own foreign assets or other foreign assets. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1277.0s)]
*  The United States can no longer produce enough antibiotics to treat our sick. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1283.0s)]
*  We have a tremendous problem. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1289.0s)]
*  We have to go to foreign countries to treat our sick. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1291.0s)]
*  If anything ever happened from a war standpoint, we wouldn't be able to do it. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1293.0s)]
*  We import virtually all of our computers, phones, televisions and electronics. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1297.0s)]
*  We used to dominate the field and now we import it all from different countries. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1302.0s)]
*  A single shipyard in China now produces more ships every year than all of the American shipyards combined. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1307.0s)]
*  Think of that. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1314.0s)]
*  And it was a business that we used to dominate. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1315.0s)]
*  We used to dominate it totally. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1318.0s)]
*  In short, chronic trade deficits are no longer merely an economic problem. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1320.0s)]
*  They're a national emergency that threatens our security and our very way of life. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1324.0s)]
*  It's a very great threat to our country. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1330.0s)]
*  And for these reasons, starting tomorrow, the United States will implement reciprocal tariffs on other nations. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1332.0s)]
*  It's been a long time since we even thought of that. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1339.0s)]
*  We used to think about it a lot. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1343.0s)]
*  We didn't think about it for many decades. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1345.0s)]
*  And you see what's happened for nations that treat us badly. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1347.0s)]
*  We will calculate the combined rate of all their tariffs, non-monetary barriers and other forms of cheating. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1351.0s)]
*  And because we are being very kind, we're kind people, very kind. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1358.0s)]
*  You're not so kind when you got ripped off with your salaries. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1364.0s)]
*  My autoworker friends and my Teamster friends and all of the unions that typically voted Democrat, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1368.0s)]
*  they're not voting Democrat anymore because worker, whether union or non-worker, they're for the Republicans now. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1374.0s)]
*  That's what happened. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1380.0s)]
*  But we will charge them approximately half of what they are and have been charging us. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1383.0s)]
*  So the tariffs will be not a full reciprocal. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1388.0s)]
*  I could have done that, yes, but it would have been tough for a lot of countries who didn't want to do that. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1394.0s)]
*  I'd like to see the chart if you have it. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1399.0s)]
*  Could you bring it up, Howard? [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1401.0s)]
*  This is our great Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1403.0s)]
*  Thanks, Howard. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1409.0s)]
*  So if you look at that, China, first row, China, 67 percent, that's tariffs charged to the USA, [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1411.0s)]
*  including currency manipulation and trade barriers. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1421.0s)]
*  He loves this visual, I think. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1425.0s)]
*  67 percent, I think you can for the most part see it. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1427.0s)]
*  Those with good eyes, with bad eyes. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1429.0s)]
*  We didn't want to bring, it's very windy out here, we didn't want to bring out the big charts because it had no chance of standing. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1431.0s)]
*  Fortunately, we came armed with a little smaller chart. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1437.0s)]
*  So 67 percent, so we're going to be charging a discounted reciprocal tariff of 34 percent. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1441.0s)]
*  I think, in other words, they charge us, we charge them, we charge them less. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1447.0s)]
*  So how can anybody be absurd? [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1451.0s)]
*  In smaller font, including currency manipulation. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1453.0s)]
*  They will be because we never charge anybody anything, but now we're going to charge them. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1455.0s)]
*  Including currency manipulation and trade barriers, so funny. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1457.0s)]
*  The European Union is very tough, very, very tough trade. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1459.0s)]
*  You can just put any number you want on there once you add those. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1461.0s)]
*  The European Union, very friendly. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1465.0s)]
*  Once you add that as a reasoning, everything is a tariff. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1467.0s)]
*  39 percent, we're going to charge them 20 percent, so we're charging them essentially half. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1471.0s)]
*  Vietnam, great negotiators, great people. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1477.0s)]
*  They like me, I like them. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1479.0s)]
*  The problem is they charge us 90 percent, we're going to charge them 46 percent tariff. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1481.0s)]
*  Taiwan, where they make, they took all of our computer chips and semiconductors. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1487.0s)]
*  We used to be the king, right? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1493.0s)]
*  We were everything, we had all of it. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1495.0s)]
*  Now we have almost none of it except the biggest company is coming in. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1497.0s)]
*  We're going to end up with almost 40 percent of these Eldens working to get their approvals. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1501.0s)]
*  And it's an amazing company, Mr. Wei, of one of the great companies of the world actually. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1505.0s)]
*  They're coming in from Taiwan and they're going to build one of the biggest plants in the world. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1511.0s)]
*  Maybe the biggest for that. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1515.0s)]
*  But 64 percent, we're going to charge them 32 percent. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1517.0s)]
*  Japan, very, very tough, great people. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1520.0s)]
*  And again, I don't blame the people for doing it. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1524.0s)]
*  I think they're very smart in doing it. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1527.0s)]
*  I blame the people that sat right in that Oval Office, right over there, right behind the resolute desk or whichever desk they chose. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1529.0s)]
*  Japan, 46 percent, they were charged us 46 percent. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1537.0s)]
*  And much higher for certain items like cars. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1540.0s)]
*  Look, he is doing this after, in after hours. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1543.0s)]
*  We're charging them 24 percent. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1547.0s)]
*  India, very, very tough, very, very tough. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1549.0s)]
*  The Prime Minister just left. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1552.0s)]
*  He's a great friend of mine, but I said you're a friend of mine. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1555.0s)]
*  I can't see this. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1558.0s)]
*  You're not treating us right. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1559.0s)]
*  They charged us 52 percent. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1561.0s)]
*  You have to understand, we charge them almost nothing for years and years and decades. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1562.0s)]
*  And it was only seven years ago when I came in, we started with China and charged them. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1566.0s)]
*  Hundreds of billions of dollars from China in tariffs. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1573.0s)]
*  And honestly, President Xi understood. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1577.0s)]
*  He said, look, I understand. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1580.0s)]
*  And the other countries, and they all understand, we're going to have to go through a little tough love, maybe. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1581.0s)]
*  But they all understand. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1587.0s)]
*  They're ripping us off and they understand. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1588.0s)]
*  Prime Minister of Japan, Shinzo was Shinzo Abe. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1591.0s)]
*  He was a fantastic man. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1597.0s)]
*  Oh, he loves Shinzo. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1599.0s)]
*  He was unfortunately taken from us, assassination. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1600.0s)]
*  Even if only Shinzo could see me now. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1602.0s)]
*  We have to do something. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1606.0s)]
*  Trade is not fair. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1607.0s)]
*  He said, I know that. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1608.0s)]
*  I know that. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1609.0s)]
*  And he was a great gentleman. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1610.0s)]
*  He was a fantastic man. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1612.0s)]
*  But he understood immediately what I was talking about. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1615.0s)]
*  I said, Shinzo, we have to do something. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1618.0s)]
*  He said, I know that. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1620.0s)]
*  And we've worked out a deal. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1621.0s)]
*  And it would have been a much better deal. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1622.0s)]
*  Could have made China a third world again. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1624.0s)]
*  Frankly, there were many years left on the deal that was made previous to my getting there. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1625.0s)]
*  But it was something. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1628.0s)]
*  Tariffs on our own cities, by the way, Pepe laughs. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1629.0s)]
*  If you look at Switzerland, 61% to 31%. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1631.0s)]
*  Indonesia, oh, look at Cambodia, 97%. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1633.0s)]
*  We're going to bring it down to 49%. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1638.0s)]
*  They made a fortune with the United States of America. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1640.0s)]
*  United Kingdom, 10%. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1643.0s)]
*  And we'll go 10%. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1645.0s)]
*  So we'll do the same thing. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1647.0s)]
*  South Africa, oh, 60%, 30%. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1649.0s)]
*  That's when he brought out the chart. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1653.0s)]
*  Bad things going on in South Africa. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1655.0s)]
*  You know, we're paying them billions of dollars. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1657.0s)]
*  We cut the funding because a lot of bad things are happening in South Africa. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1660.0s)]
*  The fake news ought to be looking at it. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1664.0s)]
*  They don't want to report it. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1665.0s)]
*  Brazil, 10%, 10%. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1667.0s)]
*  Bangladesh is 74%. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1669.0s)]
*  So you see what's going on. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1673.0s)]
*  Pakistan, 58%. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1675.0s)]
*  Sri Lanka, 88%. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1678.0s)]
*  So what we're doing is we're taking not the full. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1681.0s)]
*  We could take the full 88%. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1684.0s)]
*  Thanks a lot. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1686.0s)]
*  He's doing a very good job. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1687.0s)]
*  How's he doing? [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1688.0s)]
*  He's doing a great job. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1689.0s)]
*  I think you better take it with you. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1691.0s)]
*  It's not going to last very long. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1692.0s)]
*  He's going to put it. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1694.0s)]
*  It's going to follow you down with the wind. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1695.0s)]
*  I brought a hat just in case it got too windy. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1697.0s)]
*  But here's what anybody like a hat. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1700.0s)]
*  I'm giving I'm not giving you to a cabinet. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1703.0s)]
*  I'm giving it to the auto workers. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1705.0s)]
*  I caught it. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1707.0s)]
*  I caught it, Mr. President. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1708.0s)]
*  Thank you, fellas. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1712.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1713.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1715.0s)]
*  Hell, yeah. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1716.0s)]
*  Make the tree scream, Mr. President. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1717.0s)]
*  Our cabinet has plenty of hats. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1722.0s)]
*  But you see that you see the numbers, the numbers are so disproportionate. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1724.0s)]
*  They're so unfair. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1728.0s)]
*  At the same time, we will establish a minimum baseline tariff of 10%. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1729.0s)]
*  You notice that on the chart. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1734.0s)]
*  Let me see where this was made. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1735.0s)]
*  That'll be on other countries to help rebuild our economy and to prevent cheating. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1736.0s)]
*  It doesn't say where this hat was made, Mr. President. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1741.0s)]
*  We're going to be very severe on the people that at the gate that watch the tariffs and watch the product coming in because there's been a lot of a lot of bad things happening at the gate. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1744.0s)]
*  It's got an American flag on it, though. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1753.0s)]
*  You're talking about there's never been probably anything like it in terms of the enormity and things don't know where it was made. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1755.0s)]
*  But I think I can check it. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1763.0s)]
*  They're looking at 10 year jail sentences if they do play. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1765.0s)]
*  We're going to treat them so good. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1768.0s)]
*  But if they cheat, the repercussions are going to be extremely strong. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1769.0s)]
*  Foreign nations will finally be asked to pay for the privilege of access to our market, the biggest market in the world. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1774.0s)]
*  We're right now the biggest market in the world. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1781.0s)]
*  We had a great country four years ago in terms of the economics. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1783.0s)]
*  We were doubling up on China. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1788.0s)]
*  We were doing so well. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1789.0s)]
*  Nobody was going to catch us. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1790.0s)]
*  But so much of it slipped away over the last four years under Biden. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1792.0s)]
*  I campaigned on this policy throughout last year and today that promise was made and it was also a promise, as you know, that was kept. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1796.0s)]
*  Promises made, promises kept. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1804.0s)]
*  To any company that objects to our common sense, reciprocal tariffs, again, reciprocal back and forth, back and forth. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1810.0s)]
*  And we were I call this kind reciprocal. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1818.0s)]
*  This is not full reciprocal. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1822.0s)]
*  This is kind reciprocal. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1824.0s)]
*  But what we do is we cut it in half. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1826.0s)]
*  We charge them. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1829.0s)]
*  My answer is very simple. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1830.0s)]
*  If they complain, if you want your tariff rate to be zero, then you build your product right here in America because there is no tariff. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1831.0s)]
*  If you build your plant, your product in America in companies coming in like we've never seen before. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1839.0s)]
*  Likewise to all of the foreign presidents, prime ministers, kings, queens, ambassadors and everyone else who will soon be calling to ask for exemptions from these tariffs. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1846.0s)]
*  I say terminate your own tariffs, drop your barriers. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1856.0s)]
*  Don't manipulate your currencies. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1861.0s)]
*  Manipulate their currencies like nobody can even believe, which is a bad, bad thing and very devastating to us. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1864.0s)]
*  And start buying tens of billions of dollars of American goods. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1871.0s)]
*  Tariffs give our country protection against those that would do us economic harm. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1875.0s)]
*  And many people were looking to do us economic harm. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1880.0s)]
*  Maybe not so obviously, but they were doing tremendous economic harm. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1884.0s)]
*  But even more importantly, they will give us growth. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1890.0s)]
*  These tariffs are going to give us growth like you haven't seen before. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1893.0s)]
*  And it'll be something very special to watch. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1897.0s)]
*  I am so looking forward and Brian, it's going to happen even faster than you said. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1900.0s)]
*  You know, you might you might say, but it's already started. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1905.0s)]
*  It's already started. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1909.0s)]
*  Work's already begun on plants all around the country. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1910.0s)]
*  And you see that is before these are big rich companies. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1914.0s)]
*  We have sixty one billion dollars started on a big plant going up. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1917.0s)]
*  It's going to be announced over the next two days. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1923.0s)]
*  And they already started work. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1925.0s)]
*  Market futures describes two percent in 45 seconds. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1927.0s)]
*  Build, build, build. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1930.0s)]
*  We're going to build, build, build, sir. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1931.0s)]
*  And they came here to see me and they came wanted to know if they could have a press conference. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1933.0s)]
*  I do as many as I can. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1937.0s)]
*  I'm pretty busy trying to stop Russia and Ukraine and the Middle East. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1939.0s)]
*  We got to stop that. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1943.0s)]
*  We're going to stop the Houthis, which we're making tremendous. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1944.0s)]
*  They like shooting ships down and out of the water, sinking ships. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1948.0s)]
*  They get a kick out of it, but they're not getting such a kick out of it now. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1952.0s)]
*  Are they, Mr. Secretary? [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1955.0s)]
*  They're not getting such a kick out of that now. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1957.0s)]
*  But here are just a short list of some of the companies that have already announced and committed to investment. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1959.0s)]
*  And this is a company that built its factories and its plants in China. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1967.0s)]
*  Apple is going to spend five hundred billion dollars. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1973.0s)]
*  They never spent money like that here. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1978.0s)]
*  They're going to build their plants here. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1980.0s)]
*  SoftBank, OpenAI and Oracle, great, great companies are investing five hundred billion dollars almost immediately. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1982.0s)]
*  Nvidia, a hot company is investing hundreds of billions of dollars. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1992.0s)]
*  They just announced TSMC, the biggest, most important company in the world of chips from Taiwan, with no investment from us, is investing two hundred billion. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=1996.0s)]
*  And they said the reason was, number one, the election of November 5th and number two, the tariffs. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2008.0s)]
*  They don't want to pay the tariffs. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2013.0s)]
*  And the way they're not paying it is to build their plant here. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2015.0s)]
*  So we're going to go from almost no percentage. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2018.0s)]
*  We used to have a hundred percent of the chip market. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2020.0s)]
*  Now it's all in Taiwan, almost all of it's in Taiwan, a couple of other countries, but mostly in Taiwan. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2022.0s)]
*  And think of it, we had a hundred percent. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2028.0s)]
*  We lost it because of people in that office that didn't do their job. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2031.0s)]
*  They allowed it to be stolen from us. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2034.0s)]
*  Johnson and Johnson, great company, fifty five billion dollars. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2037.0s)]
*  Eli Lilly, twenty seven billion. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2041.0s)]
*  Metta is investing five hundred billion dollars. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2043.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2048.0s)]
*  The Mac is investing twenty billion CMA, CGM, twenty billion dollars. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2049.0s)]
*  And then you have Merck and Clarious, Stellantis, General Motors, G, aerospace, Honda, Nissan. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2056.0s)]
*  Hyundai are all putting in billions and billions of dollars and they're committed to a hundred percent. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2063.0s)]
*  In between them talking about maybe the increase of higher view counts for Asmongold, [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2069.0s)]
*  the dumbasses are talking about how it's going to lower the prices of fucking chips and GPUs. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2074.0s)]
*  With what everybody wanted to do. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2080.0s)]
*  You know, I watched a gentleman today on television, he used to work with Lee Iacocca, a very respected automobile person. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2082.0s)]
*  They're so dumb. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2088.0s)]
*  And he said, you know, because they're asking people, they try and get as many negative people as they can, [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2089.0s)]
*  but they can't find them too much. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2094.0s)]
*  Pretty hard to find in terms of what we're doing, especially when they see all this investment. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2096.0s)]
*  What are you liberated from today? Your wallet. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2100.0s)]
*  Trump is doing the remaining money in your wallet. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2103.0s)]
*  That's what you're being liberated from. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2105.0s)]
*  I can't believe it. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2107.0s)]
*  Somebody is finally he's an older guy, real pro, really top guy with Lee Iacocca. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2108.0s)]
*  He said, I never thought I'd see the day when this would happen where somebody had the courage to go and do what has to be done. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2114.0s)]
*  This is transforming our nation. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2121.0s)]
*  Our entire nation is going to be transformed not only with the cars, but on every single other item that's built. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2123.0s)]
*  We're going to become an industrial powerhouse. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2131.0s)]
*  And he said that so beautifully today. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2133.0s)]
*  In fact, I'm going to find out, I'm going to get a tape and Bruce, I'm going to get that tape and I'm going to send it to you out in Long Island. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2135.0s)]
*  And you're going to play it for the people and all your union workers and your non union workers out there. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2142.0s)]
*  You got a pretty even split. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2147.0s)]
*  But we have so far, it looks like we're going to have about six trillion dollars of investments and you wouldn't do that in years. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2150.0s)]
*  Jeff Stein tagging get fiscal. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2158.0s)]
*  Don uses so funny. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2160.0s)]
*  Six trillion dollars. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2162.0s)]
*  17 percent of Israel is hilarious. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2163.0s)]
*  And think of what six trillion dollars is. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2166.0s)]
*  You wouldn't have even a small percentage of that under this other system. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2169.0s)]
*  We're going to be a Wall Street country. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2174.0s)]
*  Maybe Black Rock did actually hire Thomas Crooks, dude. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2176.0s)]
*  Maybe Wall Street did hire Thomas Crooks. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2180.0s)]
*  Thinking about thinking about the impact this is going to have on on the American economy. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2184.0s)]
*  Perhaps they did know and they were like, we have that we have to cut it out immediately. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2191.0s)]
*  Executives and presidents of big public companies and to watch the enthusiasm they have now that they didn't have. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2197.0s)]
*  They gave up on our country. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2204.0s)]
*  They went to foreign countries and they built companies are pouring into our country at levels never seen before with jobs and money to follow. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2205.0s)]
*  And it's really beautiful. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2214.0s)]
*  In the coming days, there will be complaints from the globalists and the outsources and special interests and the fake news always fake news will always complain. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2216.0s)]
*  But never forget every prediction our opponents made about trade for the last 30 years has been proven totally wrong. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2225.0s)]
*  They were wrong about NAFTA. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2233.0s)]
*  They were wrong about China. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2235.0s)]
*  They were wrong about the trans specific which would have been a disaster if I didn't terminate it. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2237.0s)]
*  If I didn't turn that term and after hours, you know, you would have had no jobs. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2243.0s)]
*  I was all going to other countries in my first term. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2251.0s)]
*  They said tariffs would crash the economy. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2255.0s)]
*  Instead, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2259.0s)]
*  And again, I have great respect for President Xi of China, great respect for China. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2262.0s)]
*  But they were taking tremendous advantage of them of us. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2266.0s)]
*  And I commend them for that. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2271.0s)]
*  I say, hey, if you can get away with it, that's OK. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2273.0s)]
*  But, you know, they understand exactly what's happening and they probably most of them are saying it's about time they did something. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2276.0s)]
*  But and they're going to fight and they're going to fight fair. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2283.0s)]
*  Everyone's going to fight. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2286.0s)]
*  You know, it's like I say to the leaders, look, you got to take care of your country, but we have to start taking care of our country. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2287.0s)]
*  Now, we can't do what we've been doing for the last 50 years. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2293.0s)]
*  From the day of my election, the stock market went up in my first term, 88 percent with NASDAQ going up one hundred and fifty five percent more than any president has ever had in any term in office by far. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2296.0s)]
*  And I think we're going to blow that away. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2311.0s)]
*  And maybe the numbers won't show, but I think they're going to show much better than even those numbers. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2315.0s)]
*  But what you're going to see is you're going to see activity that empty dead sites, factories that are falling down. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2321.0s)]
*  Those factories will be knocked down and they're going to have brand new factories built in their place. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2327.0s)]
*  And not only talking about renovating, they're talking about brand new, the best anywhere in the world, the biggest anywhere in the world. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2332.0s)]
*  I have a friend who builds car plants and I said, I want to see the biggest and the best. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2338.0s)]
*  He said, well, we have to go to Mexico. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2343.0s)]
*  I said, no, I want to see it in the United States. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2345.0s)]
*  He said, we're not building them. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2347.0s)]
*  And then this is a year and a half ago during the campaign. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2348.0s)]
*  He said, we're not building it. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2351.0s)]
*  Have to go to Mexico. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2352.0s)]
*  When I was starting to decide to run and I went to number one in the polls very rapidly, I want to say I want to like, let's say in the first in the first hour and then shortly thereafter, it looked like I was going to win. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2354.0s)]
*  And the fake news was saying, oh, no, don't do this. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2367.0s)]
*  What they don't know is if I didn't win, they would have really been in trouble because nobody wants to read them anyway. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2370.0s)]
*  But I tell you what, when I when it looked like I was going to win, I announced that I was going to be doing exactly what we're talking about today. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2376.0s)]
*  Great consistency, actually, because I've been taught speeches when I was young, very handsome by all speeches. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2385.0s)]
*  And people would say, be on a television show. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2392.0s)]
*  I'd be talking about how we were being ripped off by these countries. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2395.0s)]
*  I mean, nothing changes very much. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2399.0s)]
*  The only thing that changed were the countries. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2400.0s)]
*  But nothing really changes. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2402.0s)]
*  But, you know, it's why it's such an honor. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2404.0s)]
*  It's such an honor to be finally able to do this. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2406.0s)]
*  If you look at China, I took in hundreds of billions of dollars in my term, hundreds of billions. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2409.0s)]
*  They never paid 10 cents to any other president. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2417.0s)]
*  And yet they paid hundreds of billions, so much so that Biden couldn't do anything. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2420.0s)]
*  They wanted to try and terminate it because he had a very special relationship. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2425.0s)]
*  I'm in private equity. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2429.0s)]
*  We just passed the relationship territory in the market. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2430.0s)]
*  But the numbers were so big. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2433.0s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2435.0s)]
*  What recession he's going to build? [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2436.0s)]
*  He's building factories tomorrow. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2439.0s)]
*  It takes only a couple of weeks, dude. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2441.0s)]
*  And then to hire all of the labor after also gutting half of the labor force in the country with these insane decisions of instead of doc be fine election. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2443.0s)]
*  A lot of bad things happen. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2454.0s)]
*  So it takes like what a couple days to build a factory and then hire and train a competent labor force. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2455.0s)]
*  What do you mean? It's fine. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2462.0s)]
*  Win. It's fine. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2463.0s)]
*  It was such an honor to see so many of you like Brian and your friends. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2465.0s)]
*  Also, also to build the factory, you do need a workforce to begin with. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2470.0s)]
*  So it's good. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2475.0s)]
*  It's good that we have that work. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2476.0s)]
*  This will be an entirely different country in a short period of time. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2477.0s)]
*  It'll be something the whole world will be talking about it. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2481.0s)]
*  The critics made the very tired predictions earlier this year. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2484.0s)]
*  But in February, core inflation dropped to the lowest rate in four years. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2488.0s)]
*  And the price of eggs, as you know, just in a couple of in a month and a half, we were there for four weeks. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2493.0s)]
*  And the first week I got blamed for eggs. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2500.0s)]
*  I said, I just got here. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2503.0s)]
*  They said eggs have gone up at like two hundred and fifty percent and you can't get eggs. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2505.0s)]
*  And they were going crazy. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2510.0s)]
*  And I said, I just got here. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2512.0s)]
*  And then we we got to work on eggs. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2515.0s)]
*  We got to work on everything. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2518.0s)]
*  And our great secretary of agriculture, you did a fantastic job, Brooke Rollins. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2520.0s)]
*  She did a fantastic job. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2525.0s)]
*  And as I said before, the price of eggs dropped now fifty nine percent and they're going down more and the availability is fantastic. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2527.0s)]
*  They were saying that for Easter, please don't use eggs. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2535.0s)]
*  Could you use plastic eggs? [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2538.0s)]
*  I said, we don't want to do that. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2539.0s)]
*  We want to. And you really came through. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2541.0s)]
*  It's amazing job. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2543.0s)]
*  Thank you very much, Brooke. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2544.0s)]
*  You did great. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2545.0s)]
*  But likewise, an old fashioned term that we use groceries. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2546.0s)]
*  I used it in the campaign. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2549.0s)]
*  It's such an old fashioned term, but a beautiful term groceries. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2551.0s)]
*  It sort of says a bag with different things in it. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2554.0s)]
*  Groceries went through the roof and I campaigned on that. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2556.0s)]
*  I talked about the word groceries for a lot and energy costs now are down. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2560.0s)]
*  Groceries are down. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2565.0s)]
*  Gasoline is way under three dollars and people are beginning to be able to buy things and live again. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2566.0s)]
*  We brought prices way down. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2572.0s)]
*  We created ten thousand already in a few weeks. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2574.0s)]
*  New manufacturing jobs. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2577.0s)]
*  And it was that took place in one month. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2579.0s)]
*  Numbers that they haven't seen in a long time. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2582.0s)]
*  We had virtually no inflation under my term. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2584.0s)]
*  We had virtually no inflation for four years. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2587.0s)]
*  But after transitioning over to sleepy Joe, it went from almost nonexistent to the highest in the history of our country. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2590.0s)]
*  They're the highest inflation in the history of our country. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2598.0s)]
*  Brought up by energy and bad spending and bad policy and a lot of bad things happened. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2602.0s)]
*  How about allowing millions and millions and millions of people to pour into our country with open borders where the you will never be able to jerk off ever again. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2607.0s)]
*  And I see no more coming. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2618.0s)]
*  You have done stand up, please, Christie. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2620.0s)]
*  Last last term, I had a pandemic. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2623.0s)]
*  Now you're going to have a band. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2626.0s)]
*  These people are doing a great job, but gotten them out in records. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2629.0s)]
*  We have problems with judges that don't want them to go out. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2634.0s)]
*  They want trend, Iraq, and they want MS 13, the most vicious gangs ever. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2637.0s)]
*  Nobody's ever seen anything like it. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2643.0s)]
*  Absolute killer gangs. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2645.0s)]
*  They kill people. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2646.0s)]
*  They don't even think about it. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2647.0s)]
*  And we put them out and we have judges now radical left judges that want to say, please, sir, I want to go out. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2648.0s)]
*  They want them to even be brought back. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2654.0s)]
*  I'm going to tell you no more coming. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2655.0s)]
*  You will never come again. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2657.0s)]
*  Please thank everybody. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2658.0s)]
*  Homeland Security. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2660.0s)]
*  Thank everybody. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2661.0s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2662.0s)]
*  And we now have a border that's the best border that we've ever had, even better than it was my first term. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2665.0s)]
*  My first term we did good. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2673.0s)]
*  But this one we really specialized in. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2674.0s)]
*  We've done really well. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2676.0s)]
*  And we had records then we had the were the best, safest border four years ago with the best border there ever was. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2677.0s)]
*  And now we have you've actually matched it and done even better. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2684.0s)]
*  And we're going to get it down the right way. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2688.0s)]
*  And we want people, by the way, to come into our country. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2691.0s)]
*  But we want to come in through a legal process. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2693.0s)]
*  We want them to come in legally. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2696.0s)]
*  We need more people. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2698.0s)]
*  We need people to run these plants and to help the other workers and the teamsters and the non-union people and everybody else. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2699.0s)]
*  But we need people, the farmers, and we're going to let people come in. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2706.0s)]
*  But they want to come in. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2710.0s)]
*  We want them to come in legally. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2711.0s)]
*  They have to have the capability of loving our country, not people that hate our country. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2712.0s)]
*  We don't want them in our country. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2716.0s)]
*  And now we're going to pass the largest tax cuts in American history. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2718.0s)]
*  And that's where we're relying on Mike and John Thune. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2723.0s)]
*  Uh oh. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2726.0s)]
*  And we will not cut Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid benefits. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2727.0s)]
*  And the Democrats will because if they got in, the entire economy would collapse. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2732.0s)]
*  This country is heading for a collapse. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2738.0s)]
*  Amazing. So mass. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2740.0s)]
*  Under the people that you saw. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2742.0s)]
*  So complete fucking tax cuts. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2743.0s)]
*  I think one of the reasons people like the job. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2745.0s)]
*  And my highest approval rate is because I think they're comparing me to the worst administration in the history of our country. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2747.0s)]
*  So I appreciate that at least. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2754.0s)]
*  But Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, Majority Leader. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2756.0s)]
*  Appreciate it, Mike. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2759.0s)]
*  John Thune have been fantastic. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2760.0s)]
*  No more progressive taxation. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2763.0s)]
*  I hate progress. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2765.0s)]
*  But they've been working tirelessly on taking the next step to pass the plan for our one big, beautiful bill. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2766.0s)]
*  I like to name it that if you can. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2772.0s)]
*  One big, beautiful. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2775.0s)]
*  I made that statement about six months ago. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2776.0s)]
*  And everybody calls it one big, beautiful bill. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2778.0s)]
*  And it will be that. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2780.0s)]
*  It'll have everything. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2781.0s)]
*  The big tax cuts and every incentive there is. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2782.0s)]
*  It'll be fantastic. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2785.0s)]
*  And by the way, for the cars, we're asking for an interest deduction on a loan. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2788.0s)]
*  So if you build the car only in America, we do it. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2792.0s)]
*  Brian, if the car is not built in America, you don't get the interest rate deduction. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2795.0s)]
*  But if you build the car in America, if you buy a car, if it's built in America, then you get an interest rate deduction, tax deduction. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2799.0s)]
*  And that's a big thing. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2808.0s)]
*  It's going to be a big thing. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2810.0s)]
*  I think that's going to pay for itself very quickly. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2811.0s)]
*  That deduction never happened. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2813.0s)]
*  We've never had anything like that before. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2815.0s)]
*  Somebody said, where do you get the idea? [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2817.0s)]
*  Because it's so basic. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2818.0s)]
*  You would think that would have happened a long time ago. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2819.0s)]
*  It never did. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2821.0s)]
*  And I'm very happy it didn't, because now I can say that was my idea. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2822.0s)]
*  But we're going to get us closer to the debt extension. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2828.0s)]
*  We have to get the debt extension passed. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2833.0s)]
*  And I know you're going to be able to do that, Mike. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2835.0s)]
*  And it's very important that you do that. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2837.0s)]
*  And all of the other things that the Senate budget plan gives us along with working because I know they're working together, John and Mike. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2839.0s)]
*  And the two bills are going very well together. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2846.0s)]
*  We need to get our shared priorities done, including certain permanent tax cuts. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2849.0s)]
*  We want the tax cuts to be permanent spending cuts, energy and historic investments in defense border and so much more. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2854.0s)]
*  We're covering everything. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2862.0s)]
*  These will be phenomenal. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2863.0s)]
*  There'll be no no bill like this going to straighten. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2865.0s)]
*  One bill is going to straighten out our country for many, many years to come. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2867.0s)]
*  And we said, let's just do it and let's get it done. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2871.0s)]
*  And some guys will love it. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2874.0s)]
*  And some guys will like it a little bit less because they're not getting what they were exactly looking for. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2876.0s)]
*  But they're getting a lot. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2881.0s)]
*  They'll never if we get this done, it'll be the most incredible bill ever passed in the history of our Congress and Senate and congressmen, the senators and the congressmen, many of whom are here today. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2882.0s)]
*  We'll be very proud of themselves. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2894.0s)]
*  I really believe that it's going to set us on a whole new prosperous path. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2896.0s)]
*  We're going to cut spending and right size the budget back to where it should be. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2901.0s)]
*  We're going to do that very strongly. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2905.0s)]
*  Thank you, Rick. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2909.0s)]
*  Thank you, John. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2910.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2911.0s)]
*  Oh, look, look at all of our senators over. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2912.0s)]
*  Oh, boy, that's a nice group of people, but I won't like them so much if they don't get this bill done. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2914.0s)]
*  That's a great group. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2922.0s)]
*  And, Congressman, thank you very much. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2923.0s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2925.0s)]
*  Tremendous people. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2926.0s)]
*  The Senate plan is my complete and total support. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2927.0s)]
*  And the House plan likewise is very similar. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2930.0s)]
*  They're moving along pretty much at the same clip. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2933.0s)]
*  And as soon as you're ready, you'll show it to me and I'm sure it'll have my support. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2936.0s)]
*  Mike, every Republican congressman and senator must unify. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2939.0s)]
*  We have to unify. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2944.0s)]
*  We can't be separated. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2945.0s)]
*  We have to get it done. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2947.0s)]
*  We have to get absolutely everything we can and we have to take care of the American people. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2948.0s)]
*  That's the only thing that matters. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2952.0s)]
*  We have to take care of the American people first. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2954.0s)]
*  We need to pass this bill immediately. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2956.0s)]
*  Get it done, including debt extension. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2959.0s)]
*  From this day on, we're not going to let anyone tell us that American workers and families cannot have the future that they deserve. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2962.0s)]
*  We're going to produce the cars and ships, chips, airplanes, minerals and medicines that we need right here in America. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2969.0s)]
*  The pharmaceutical companies are going to become roaring back. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2977.0s)]
*  They're coming roaring back. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2981.0s)]
*  They're all coming back to our country because if they don't, they got a big tax to pay. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2982.0s)]
*  And if they do, I'll be very happy. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2987.0s)]
*  And you're going to be very happy and you're going to be very safe. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2990.0s)]
*  We're going to build our future with American hands, with American heart, American steel. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2992.0s)]
*  And we're going to build it with American pride like we used to. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=2998.0s)]
*  We're approaching our 100th day as president and have been given credit by a lot of people, actually. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3002.0s)]
*  Even some of the fake news, can you believe it? [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3010.0s)]
*  Which in this case, hopefully isn't fake. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3013.0s)]
*  They'll definitely be giving you credit for this. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3015.0s)]
*  For having done more in that time than any other administration in the history of our country. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3016.0s)]
*  They'll definitely be crediting you for what's going on now. Trust me. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3020.0s)]
*  In the first 100 days, amazing in terms of what we've done, what we've gotten accomplished. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3021.0s)]
*  Like to see if we can get that war ended and another war from not starting in the Middle East. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3026.0s)]
*  We have to get Russia. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3033.0s)]
*  They're losing 2000 on average, 2500 people that they're young people, soldiers, Russians. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3035.0s)]
*  Think of that. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3042.0s)]
*  2500 through some days. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3043.0s)]
*  But on average, probably over about a one week period, it's 2712, they say. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3046.0s)]
*  They're losing those soldiers. They're dying. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3054.0s)]
*  They're being decimated. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3057.0s)]
*  And they're not from our country, but they're from other countries. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3058.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm noticing a lot of people being mentioned in this speech. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3062.0s)]
*  You guys notice that too? [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3066.0s)]
*  And we're going to get it stopped. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3068.0s)]
*  It's a senseless war that would have never happened if I was president. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3070.0s)]
*  That it shouldn't be allowed to go on. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3073.0s)]
*  And I think we're being given good cooperation by Russia and by Ukraine, but we have to get it stopped. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3076.0s)]
*  It's humanity. It's humanity. It's a terrible thing. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3084.0s)]
*  This will be a very big moment. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3088.0s)]
*  I think you're going to remember today. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3091.0s)]
*  It's going to be a free nation that we're dealing with. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3093.0s)]
*  We're going to have a very free and beautiful nation. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3096.0s)]
*  It's going to be Liberation Day in America. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3099.0s)]
*  And it's going to be a day that hopefully you're going to look back in years to come and you're going to say, [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3102.0s)]
*  you know, he was right. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3107.0s)]
*  This has turned out to be one of the most important days in the history of our country. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3108.0s)]
*  God bless you and God bless America. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3112.0s)]
*  Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3114.0s)]
*  So there you have it. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3116.0s)]
*  President Trump in the Rose Garden at the White House on what he has dubbed Liberation Day. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3117.0s)]
*  When it comes to the economy, he has announced reciprocal tariffs against countries all over the world. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3121.0s)]
*  He has said, basically, what we are going to do is reciprocal tariffs charge countries what they charge us to sell our products in their countries. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3126.0s)]
*  And instead of charging them exactly what they charge us in his words, [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3137.0s)]
*  we have to take his numbers for what they are at this moment, that the U.S. will charge half as much as what other countries are doing. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3141.0s)]
*  Why would you take his word? [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3147.0s)]
*  He said China, and this is the number calculated by the White House, they charge 67 percent in tariffs on American goods and other charges. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3149.0s)]
*  So the U.S. will now charge 34 percent. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3157.0s)]
*  The EU, our allies, he says they rip us off. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3160.0s)]
*  He says they charge about 39 percent in tariffs and other charges. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3164.0s)]
*  We will charge them now about half that 20 percent. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3168.0s)]
*  It went down the list of a number of countries. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3171.0s)]
*  He said Vietnam, our allies, he said, I like them, but they charge us 90 percent. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3174.0s)]
*  We'll charge them about half that at about 40. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3178.0s)]
*  I will say this much. OK, the markets might be screaming at this moment, but ultimately, that's not the most reliable metric for seeing the damage that this will do. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3180.0s)]
*  So they'll fucking rebound tomorrow. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3190.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3194.0s)]
*  But what's important to understand here is what will most likely happen to U.S. trade and specifically the cost of goods. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3195.0s)]
*  The cost of goods is going to go up a lot. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3202.0s)]
*  A better indication of how you feel, a better indication of how you experience the economy will be inflation from here moving forward. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3206.0s)]
*  Well, the negotiation that could happen going forward is certainly on the table here. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3215.0s)]
*  And he even sort of opened the door to that as he was talking to the. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3221.0s)]
*  We can have conversations with these foreign countries, but the big headline here is that this is based on the White House's math. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3224.0s)]
*  But these are very high numbers, a 34 percent tariff on China, 20 percent tariff on the EU, 26 percent on India and that 10 percent minimum. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3231.0s)]
*  That's not insignificant. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3240.0s)]
*  Let's go to Rachel Scott right there in the Rose Garden. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3242.0s)]
*  Rachel, the temperature there in the garden. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3244.0s)]
*  She's standing by for us momentarily. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3246.0s)]
*  Mary Bruce is on the other side of the White House. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3248.0s)]
*  Marius Rebecca says these are historic tariffs not seen at this level at quick math here since the early nineteen hundreds. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3250.0s)]
*  This would be an extraordinary shift. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3259.0s)]
*  And we did not hear a lot from the president about any immediate impact on the American consumer, the customer who goes to the grocery store, the mall, the auto lot to buy a car. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3261.0s)]
*  We didn't hear a lot of detail about what the initial impact could be here. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3271.0s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder why the president is adamant that these tariffs are going to boost the U.S. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3275.0s)]
*  economy, that it's going to spur a renaissance in American manufacturing. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3279.0s)]
*  But economists have warned that that takes time, that it could be months or even years to boost production on American soil. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3282.0s)]
*  And in the meantime, they say American consumers are going to bear the brunt of this. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3288.0s)]
*  The costs are going to skyrocket. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3291.0s)]
*  The president didn't touch on that in these lengthy remarks. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3293.0s)]
*  Now, in the past, he has said that Americans should be braced for some short term pain. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3296.0s)]
*  The question is, how long is that pain going to last? [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3300.0s)]
*  And when pressed on that in recent days, the White House has said simply that Americans need to trust the president and have faith. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3303.0s)]
*  David, Mary Bruce, right there at the White House at the Rose Garden, Rachel Scott also standing by. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3309.0s)]
*  Rachel, I understand you can hear me now. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3314.0s)]
*  There you are with the crowd there behind you. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3315.0s)]
*  They liked what they were hearing. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3317.0s)]
*  And, of course, the question is how our allies will respond to this around the world, our friends around the world with these extraordinarily high tariffs that the president says are long overdue. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3318.0s)]
*  And again, initial impact. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3329.0s)]
*  And when I say initial, this could be in many weeks, several months, if you will, because also economists say if you want to bring products back to America, it's going to take quite some time before that can get up and running. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3332.0s)]
*  How long do you think it will take to build a factory? [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3342.0s)]
*  Exactly, David. And even those who are here, steelworkers, autoworkers, they acknowledge that while they are supportive of the president's plan, that this is not going to be like a light switch on and off, that this could take time. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3344.0s)]
*  And even once you build a factory and you hire the workers and you train the workers, it's going to take a long time for them to even build a factory to even get the workers and train the workers to build a factory to begin with. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3355.0s)]
*  But even after that, there is a runway here that is tremendously long, much longer than the couple months that they're suggesting. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3364.0s)]
*  Okay, but also on top of that, the fucking goods that they need, the materials that they need to do manufacturing that are coming from outside of the United States, the cost of that is going up to it's so stupid. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3374.0s)]
*  BC news.com for many of you. Your local news is standing by right here in the East. And of course, I'll be back here with the entire team for World News tonight. I'm David Muir in New York. Good day. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3389.0s)]
*  Why the long face David get it because he has a long face. Yeah, American glorious liberation day liberating us from living in [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCmUv28md8Y&t=3398.0s)]
