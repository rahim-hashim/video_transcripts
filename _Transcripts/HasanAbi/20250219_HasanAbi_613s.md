# Trump's New Military Policy Is Insane | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc)
*  The move will mark Trump's latest assault on federal bureaucracy that he's convinced [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=0.0s)]
*  is hostile to his agenda. Like he has with Elon Musk, Doe, Jeff or Trump will also cite [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=3.6s)]
*  his concerns about the millions of dollars. Some of the committees cost taxpayers. Officials [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=8.22s)]
*  said Trump. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=11.44s)]
*  Yes, it's war with Mexico or at least like blowing up Mexican territory. CIA has been [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=14.44s)]
*  covertly flying MQ nine Reaper drones over Mexico to spy on drug cartels. Her and a former [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=26.76s)]
*  officials familiar with the matter told CNN part of Trump's shift to treat shift to treat [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=31.8s)]
*  cartels like orgs. Also it is pretty funny to fly Reaper drones to figure out what the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=35.400000000000006s)]
*  cartel is doing instead of just asking their guys, you know, who are either currently working [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=42.36s)]
*  with the cartel or in the past worked with the cartel. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=49.64s)]
*  Just yell at the guy sitting on the opposite side of the room to be like, Hey, what's the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=54.44s)]
*  deal? What's the deal with the cartel file? Can you pull it over here? I just want to [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=61.04s)]
*  take a look. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=65.88s)]
*  AP said Claudia approved it. What's up with that? Maybe Yo, it's on, did you go over the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=66.88s)]
*  14 flag tweet yet on Twitter? What? Because Elon Musk posted 14 flags, 14 American flags [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=72.92s)]
*  indicating the 14 words or something. Yes. Elon Musk is a racist. Next question. Defense [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=79.30000000000001s)]
*  secretary orders military to prepare for major budget cuts. Yeah. It was issued the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=84.7s)]
*  day before president Donald Trump endorsed the house's budget plan, which includes a [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=88.5s)]
*  hundred billion dollar increase in defense spending, suggesting a major disconnect within [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=91.62s)]
*  the administration. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=96.38000000000001s)]
*  So while Trump is claiming that he wants 8% budget cuts on the department of defense, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=97.74000000000001s)]
*  on the other hand, he already, he already signed off on a hundred billion dollars of [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=105.78s)]
*  increase in defense spending. Current defense spending is nearing a trillion dollars. It's [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=109.9s)]
*  like around almost 900 billion. So an additional 100 billion would make it basically a trillion [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=115.22s)]
*  dollars. How does that work? Also they've already, they've already talked about what [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=122.22s)]
*  parts not to cut. Pete Hegson made some Pete Hegson made some demands about what won't [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=127.78s)]
*  get cut. And of course he did not say VA should not be cut or I don't know, additional, additional [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=135.06s)]
*  things that are helpful. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=144.78s)]
*  The exemptions exist for 17 categories. Where is it? Yeah. This I asked the military and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=146.1s)]
*  depart military departments and DOD components, resource, the capabilities and readiness necessary [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=153.78s)]
*  for wartime tempo and offset. Those are crimes with low impact items such as wasteful DEI [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=157.56s)]
*  and climate change programs. They're going to cut VA. They're going to cut any benefits [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=163.38s)]
*  and any like additional social safety. And as you get, when you are a veteran and it [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=169.94s)]
*  still will not amount to a 8% cut, there's no other, there's no other place that they [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=174.33999999999997s)]
*  will genuinely cut from. It's crazy. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=179.1s)]
*  Hold on. Yeah. Military family housing, things like that will get cut, which is ironic because [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=181.1s)]
*  when you cut the benefits package in times of a recruitment crisis, how the hell Oracle [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=189.02s)]
*  Lassonde is out here making a prediction. That's dangerous. I mean, come on. How the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=195.66000000000003s)]
*  hell are you going to beef up recruitment numbers? Like that's what's so funny about [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=199.66000000000003s)]
*  this entire process. Trump is saying we have to one fire a bunch of transgender operators [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=205.42000000000002s)]
*  and non-combatant staff. Okay. That's number one at a time when the military is experiencing [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=214.23999999999998s)]
*  historically low recruitment numbers, they're also simultaneously most likely going to cut [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=220.88s)]
*  benefits for veterans. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=227.88s)]
*  So how are you going to improve the recruitment numbers is good for the Chinese century chill [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=230.64s)]
*  by lowering living standards by a lot. Okay. But you're, but you're not making it so that [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=235.23999999999998s)]
*  the military makes things better. If you're cutting the benefits, if you are eliminating [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=242.20000000000002s)]
*  the one part of the poverty draft, that means that you will get upward social mobility. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=246.52s)]
*  If you join the military and your life up, then why would you ever join the military? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=252.76s)]
*  It's all good. Don't worry. As miss chess going to join. Yeah, that's right. I have [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=259.44s)]
*  it on good authority that as men's neckbeard army was talking about how, you know, now [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=262.8s)]
*  that they said they're banning transgenders from the military, I really thought about [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=268.72s)]
*  joining the Marine Corps brother. Yeah. Also speaking of which the CIA in as far as the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=272.20000000000005s)]
*  CIA surveillance, the drones are not armed and the CIA is flown surveillance drones to [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=279.20000000000005s)]
*  hunt cartels since inside Mexico before, according to a former and current U S official under [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=282.24s)]
*  at least one small program that partnered with Mexican authorities. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=286.84000000000003s)]
*  But the more recent flights were communicated to Congress using a particular notification [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=290.12s)]
*  reserve or new or updated covert programs that the CIA intends either to conceal or [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=293.6s)]
*  deny a source familiar with the matter said, suggesting that the flights represent a distinct [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=298.16s)]
*  escalation CIA declined the comments specifically about the drones. A spokesperson said broadly [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=302.6s)]
*  that countering drug cartels in Mexico regionally is a priority for the CIA. They're like, we [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=306.8s)]
*  built it. Now we break it. That's crazy. I can't believe the CIA. I thought Donald Trump [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=310.8s)]
*  was ending wasteful government spending. And here you have the CIA surveilling more of [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=316.64000000000004s)]
*  the CIA, but in another country, this is weird. This is weird to me. It doesn't exactly. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=321.52s)]
*  It doesn't exactly show that you're cutting wasteful government spending. If you're making [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=328.21999999999997s)]
*  the CIA surveil itself weird, a transition doc, 20, 25 agency action plan reviewed by [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=332.28s)]
*  CNN said that the admin should do a treat counter drug cartel to treat counter drug [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=337.84s)]
*  cartel work as a form of counter and to use those authorities and unique resources appropriately, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=342.71999999999997s)]
*  resource from other regions if necessary. Trump plans to sign an executive order to [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=348.56s)]
*  eliminate or dramatically diminish a handful of federal advisory committees like the United [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=352.28000000000003s)]
*  States Institute of peace, according to administration officials. Okay. This one's fair to be, to [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=355.84s)]
*  be fair. Like, I mean, what, what kind of, what kind of, what kind of success have these [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=361.32s)]
*  guys gotten so far? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=368.72s)]
*  They have, they have had a horrid track record. Okay. Like where were these, where were these [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=371.16s)]
*  guys during the endless bombing campaign that amounts to a genocide in Gaza? I don't know. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=377.96000000000004s)]
*  The executive order was your president plans to sign on air force one will target organizations [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=384.68s)]
*  like the United States Institute of peace and the inter-American foundation. The order [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=387.92s)]
*  is a similar to his assertion Tuesday night that he has direct authority over boards and [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=392.04s)]
*  the FDIC, sec and CFTC. Okay, dude, Jesus Christ. The move will mark Trump's latest [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=398.3s)]
*  assault on federal bureaucracy that he's convinced is hostile to his agenda. Like he has with [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=404.54s)]
*  Elon Musk, Doe, Jeff or Trump will also cite his concerns about the millions of dollars. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=409.42s)]
*  Some of the committees cost taxpayers. Officials said Trump will also require his cabinet to [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=412.78000000000003s)]
*  scrub their departments and submit a list of additional committees and boards with termination [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=416.62s)]
*  for in the next 30 days among the groups that Trump will single out for termination or reduction. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=419.90000000000003s)]
*  The Presidio trust, a federal agency that manages large parts of the Presidio in speaker [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=424.84s)]
*  Emma Ritter, Nancy Pelosi's San Francisco district, the U S African development foundation, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=429.47999999999996s)]
*  which invests in African grassroots enterprises, the presidential management fellows program, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=434.71999999999997s)]
*  which is designed to train academics and other qualified applicants on how to serve in the [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=439.32s)]
*  executive branch. Yeah. We don't want academics in the executive branch. Why would we want [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=442.91999999999996s)]
*  their woke losers that learn not to be loyal to Donald Trump, which is the most important [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=451.16s)]
*  part of this most important qualification. The advisory committee on voluntary aid, which [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=456.3s)]
*  was founded to advise the U S agency of for international development and other U S government [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=460.92s)]
*  agencies on development, development issues regarding foreign assistance, the health equity [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=465.5s)]

*  In the lines, the Institute for peace is being targeted in part because of its officials [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=477.54s)]
*  believe it's a highly partisan organization with its employees contributing to the democratic [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=480.28000000000003s)]
*  party and they consider the inter-American foundation, which was designed to invest in [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=483.90000000000003s)]
*  development projects across Latin America and the Caribbean as a vehicle to justify [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=487.36s)]
*  democratic theories about the root causes of migration. Oh my God. Okay. Yes. I saw [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=490.24s)]

*  that they engaged in. Okay. I don't know deep enough about like all of the lame propaganda [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=520.42s)]
*  that they engaged in, but we're yes, not only and gross and inhumane and pieces of shit, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=525.08s)]
*  but we're also very lame on top of that. Like we are literally engaging in this weird process [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=531.44s)]
*  where, I mean, this is like positively liberal, if that makes sense. Like the white house [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JaUoGB_Rc&t=539.2s)]
