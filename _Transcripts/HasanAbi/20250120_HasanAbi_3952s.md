# Trump Signs His First Executive Orders | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo)
*  Holy moly. The glass thing to see her fully back by his side. See that's the difference. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=0.0s)]
*  When I talk about like objective truths in terms of like Trump playing a role in tick [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=8.68s)]
*  tock, being unbanned, at least for the time being, even if I tell you like things are [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=12.58s)]
*  going to get much worse down the line or about the quote unquote ceasefire, the small short [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=16.34s)]
*  window of the ceasefire. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=23.22s)]
*  I'm just telling you what the truth is. I'm not going to sit here and be like iconic, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=25.1s)]
*  the iconic fist bump. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=28.92s)]
*  Priced of undocumented migrants that work to defend undocumented migrants and talked [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=35.32s)]
*  about methods of organizing against Trump's obviously insane and cruel and violent anti-immigrant [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=40.44s)]
*  policies months ahead of time. And I will always continue to do so. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=48.72s)]
*  Saying that I haven't talked significantly or talked enough about undocumented migrants [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=52.36s)]
*  is a stupid to saying that I'm like a transphobic or something. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=60.519999999999996s)]
*  Trump is back on the cameras. Let's see what he's doing. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=63.6s)]
*  Did you see Trump? Did you see Ilan do a questionable salute? It wasn't a questionable salute. There [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=80.12s)]
*  was no question of what the salute was. He hit the sig. Hile and he hit it twice. Okay. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=89.60000000000001s)]
*  He that wasn't questionable. I think there's nothing in question there that wasn't suspicious. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=98.04s)]
*  Nothing suspicious about that. Very obviously the guy who bought Twitter and turned it into [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=103.76s)]
*  a neo Nazi farming ground did the Nazi salute on stage twice. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=109.24s)]
*  And he did it very deliberately. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=114.88s)]
*  These are his executive orders that he's going to sign, I guess, symbolically in front of the people. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=140.16s)]
*  ABC has titles, subtitles. Can you link it to Macy's? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=146.04s)]
*  The supporters were able to get to the president of the United States and he is taking this moment [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=169.16s)]
*  in an inaugural parade that has somewhat of a feel of a political rally, David. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=181.04s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. I think that that is well put. This is a Donald Trump inaugural parade. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=185.12s)]
*  This is what an inaugural parade would look like in 2025 if you had to imagine it. If he had won [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=192.92s)]
*  the election and now he has and to have the family up at sort of the reviewing stand and the audience [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=198.84s)]
*  cheering for who they think is their favorite Trump and the desk now set up. And I think we have [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=203.84s)]
*  an image there of just the pile of what we believe he shamelessly replying with the salute [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=208.76000000000002s)]
*  executive orders that President Trump will take action on. No, that's not first hour. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=214.56s)]
*  You're reading too much of being in office. We know he has talked about this in his inaugural [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=220.88000000000002s)]
*  address, the border declaring an emergency in the southern border. Here is the prep work. We [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=227.0s)]
*  captured this image earlier today of them placing these on the table, of course, with the presidential [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=232.04s)]
*  seal, which was placed there within moments of Donald Trump taking the oath of office here this [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=237.4s)]
*  afternoon and that familiar fist bump. And of course, that image from Butler, Pennsylvania, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=242.84s)]
*  John Karl, when there was an assassination attempt, an attempt on his life, the fact that Donald Trump [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=248.16s)]
*  was able to stand up and hold his fist to the air. That was an extraordinary moment and one that [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=254.32s)]
*  will go down as having a true, true impact on this campaign and how people see Donald Trump. David, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=260.52s)]
*  it was the defining moment of Donald Trump's campaign. It was the defining moment of that [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=266.76s)]
*  entire campaign. It may well be the defining moment of Donald Trump's political life. I think some [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=271.68s)]
*  people close to him believe that it was in that moment that he solidified the fact that he was [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=278.88s)]
*  going to win that election. I mean, it was coming to your feet, bloodied. And also what he said, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=283.52s)]
*  fight, fight. Oh my God. The writing is out of control. Glaze bro dial it back, dude. Take the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=289.2s)]
*  dick out of your mouth. Take the dick out of your mouth. You can't do commentary like that on the [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=299.64s)]
*  campaign. She made a brief appearance at the Holy moly. The glazed thing to see her fully back by [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=303.26s)]
*  his side. See that's the difference. What, when I talk about like objective truths in terms of [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=311.68s)]
*  like Trump playing a role in tick tock being unbanned, at least for the time being, even if [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=316.44s)]
*  I tell you like things are going to get much worse down the line or about the quote unquote [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=320.44s)]
*  ceasefire, the small short window of the ceasefire. I'm just telling you what the truth is. I'm not [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=326.12s)]
*  going to sit here and be like iconic, the iconic fist bumping that he did after he got shot that [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=332.03999999999996s)]
*  changed the tide of history. That's glaze. One is objectively telling you the truth. The other is [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=337.84s)]
*  glaze. What the media is doing here. What ABC news is doing here is glaze. Okay. And that kind of [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=344.64s)]
*  glaze plays a very important role in normalizing Donald Trump further, which is going to happen, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=350.96s)]
*  by the way. And as I told you this already, there is no hashtag resistance liberalism. Okay. It's [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=357.03999999999996s)]
*  done. It's over. It's not going to happen this time around. It is no longer. Trump is no longer [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=363.84s)]
*  being treated as an aberration. Okay. Who cast aside the, the civility and the optics of liberalism. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=368.96s)]
*  And he is just now seen as a normal Republican. This is the Republican party. And in many ways, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=375.84s)]
*  it was already the normal Republican party, but now the media is openly embracing it as such. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=380.56s)]
*  Do you see, I believe those are, yes, some of those were there in Butler, Pennsylvania. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=385.44s)]
*  And of course, remembering the person who lost their life there in Butler, Pennsylvania. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=389.36s)]
*  As well, Martha, I believe the president will probably look back at this moment and say, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=393.92s)]
*  I'm glad we were at the arena. This is a more intimate gathering and this is more, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=398.0s)]
*  as Mary said, more like a Trump rally. And it has the DNA of Donald Trump and his supporters and, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=402.32s)]
*  and the American voters who were determined to be there for Donald Trump. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=410.71999999999997s)]
*  As he said in his speech this morning at the Capitol, he built by God to make America great [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=415.92s)]
*  again after that assassination attempt and that, and that fist you put up. So that he put up. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=425.12s)]
*  So when you see these citizens from Pennsylvania walking by and law enforcement, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=432.0s)]
*  firefighters, these are Donald Trump's people. You know, Donald Trump loves this. He thrives on [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=438.24s)]
*  this. This is what he does at rallies. He loves having that crowd there. And so in that, in that [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=446.64000000000004s)]
*  arena, it really is more intimate, not just for the people there, but for Donald Trump. This feels [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=454.0s)]
*  exactly like the rallies he's held again and again. And of course, he's looking to see how he did. We [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=459.84000000000003s)]
*  heard him right after his speech in the inaugural speech saying, it's going to play great. I thought [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=466.08s)]
*  it would play great. And the reviews have been great. That's what he's looking for today too. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=472.24s)]
*  And Rachel Scott, who was there in the arena, of course, was our reporter on the scene that day [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=476.88s)]
*  in Butler. Rachel. It is striking, David, to see this procession that is happening. Those first [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=481.36s)]
*  responders from Butler County walked out to applause carrying that uniform from Cory Compentour, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=489.52s)]
*  someone who died ultimately shielding his family. I remember being there in Butler in this year, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=496.15999999999997s)]
*  panic that that was as the president-elect covered his ear. He was rushed out and then he raised his [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=501.91999999999996s)]
*  fist in the air. You remember those striking images as he said, fight, fight, fight. And I thought of [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=508.47999999999996s)]
*  that moment again today, as the president of the United States was inside of the Capitol taking the [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=513.04s)]
*  oath and right after putting up his fist three times. Once again, you saw him do it just a moment [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=518.0s)]
*  ago as well. Fight, fight, fight. It became the mantra of his campaign. Many people in this arena [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=522.72s)]
*  repeating it right back to him, David. Rachel, thank you. Special event. Let us now take a [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=527.52s)]
*  moment of silence in honor of Cory Comparatory. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=533.92s)]
*  Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=548.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=578.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=595.44s)]
*  Tom and Jerry as music. We now present to you the New York Military Academy from Cornwall on Hudson, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=605.44s)]
*  New York. New York Military Academy stands out due to its unique connection to the president himself. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=611.84s)]
*  President Trump is a 1964 graduate and has been enshrined as one of our alumni's of distinction. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=618.48s)]
*  This historic academy has been named a junior reserve officer training corps. That's JROTC [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=625.9200000000001s)]
*  and are marching with their cadet dress uniforms. Look at these, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=632.4000000000001s)]
*  all modeled after post-World War I general Black Jack Pershing's gray uniform. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=636.0s)]
*  So [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=655.9200000000001s)]
*  so [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=666.88s)]
*  it's too cold outside. So they're doing an indoor parade chat. That's what's going on right now. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=679.68s)]
*  Introducing the Palm Beach Police and Fire Honor Guard unit representing the town of Palm Beach, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=686.72s)]
*  Florida. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=692.48s)]
*  This group consists of police officers and firefighters from the town of Palm Beach, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=698.0s)]
*  home to some of the most prestigious people in the world, including President Donald J. Trump. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=702.5600000000001s)]
*  So [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=782.48s)]
*  the [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=789.12s)]
*  the band has had the distinct honor to perform at the 75th commemoration of the attack on Pearl [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=803.44s)]
*  Harbor in Oahu, Hawaii. The band has also played for hospitalized children, military veterans, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=808.24s)]
*  as well as the 1980 and 2005 presidential inaugural parades and his holiness, Pope John Paul II. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=814.72s)]
*  The NYPD Emerald Society pipes and drums formed way back in 1960 and you know they are the oldest, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=823.28s)]
*  largest police pipe band in the United States comprised of all active and retired police officers [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=830.08s)]
*  of various ranks and assignments. Listen to those bagpipes. Let's hear it for folks. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=836.8s)]
*  And look at this. Here's one that hits close to home for our vice president. We now welcome [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=896.8s)]
*  the Middletown High School marching band and cheerleaders. They're traveling all the way from [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=919.1999999999999s)]
*  Middletown, Ohio to proudly represent their school, our nation and outstanding alumni, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=925.44s)]
*  including our new vice president of the United States, JD Vance. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=931.84s)]
*  So [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=940.5600000000001s)]
*  putting miners in a room with the highest file per capita density is definitely a choice, you know. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=951.84s)]
*  The band has performed in countless parades, community and sporting events, as well as [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=970.08s)]
*  competitions. They have also always qualified for the Ohio Music Educators Association [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=982.08s)]
*  state finals for 23 years straight. How about that? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=987.6s)]
*  And have earned the highest rating in 18 of those appearances. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=992.24s)]
*  And today they performed America's Sweet Land of Liberty. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1001.6800000000001s)]
*  The national nightmare begins to thunderous applause. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1052.24s)]
*  ACLU has already started. The Trump admin is already facing its first legal filing [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1172.56s)]
*  as decision to shut down CBP one. The ACLU filed a motion existing case against Biden's [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1183.44s)]
*  asylum restrictions along the US southern border. ACLU and partners requested an immediate status [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1188.48s)]
*  conference. Good luck. Godspeed. I just don't think that we have any, I have no more confidence [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1193.44s)]
*  in any of the courts to hold up anything. Like I think these guys are, that was the last four, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1206.72s)]
*  I mean not the last, sorry, that was the first four years of Trump. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1219.76s)]
*  And they are wearing their most notable uniforms. What a great photo opportunity [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1249.84s)]
*  consisting of the Glengarry headgear and kilts. And they are proud to honor their fallen brothers [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1264.48s)]
*  and sisters. Each and every. Steve Wittoff is talking. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1269.76s)]
*  About Gaza. This achievement demonstrates the strength of President Trump's leadership [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1279.44s)]
*  and the respect he commands on the global stage. It is yet another example of his ability [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1285.92s)]
*  to deliver results in the most complex and challenging situations. The Abraham Accords, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1292.4s)]
*  a testament to his vision and determination, have also brought historic progress to the region, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1299.76s)]
*  transforming old rivalries into new alliances. These agreements are not merely symbolic. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1307.2s)]
*  They represent a practical roadmap for peace, economic cooperation, and mutual respect [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1314.96s)]
*  across nations. My role as President Trump has tasked me is straightforward yet profoundly [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1322.48s)]
*  challenging to turn his vision into actionable outcomes. He sets the agenda, he lays the framework, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1330.3999999999999s)]
*  and he inspires people like me into bold action. My responsibility is to implement his vision, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1340.0s)]
*  engaging with leaders across the region to find pathways towards sustainable peace and stability. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1348.64s)]
*  And let me tell you, having Donald Trump as a boss makes this task not only possible, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1356.72s)]
*  but far more effective. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1363.44s)]
*  President Trump's reputation as a leader who delivers results resonates far beyond Washington. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1374.72s)]
*  Leaders in the Middle East know he means what he says. His ability to cut through bureaucratic [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1383.28s)]
*  gridlock and focus on tangible results is the game changer. It allows me to approach delicate [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1389.28s)]
*  negotiations with the confidence that the full weight of the United States is behind me. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1397.2s)]
*  The principles President Trump has laid out for our approach to the Middle East and foreign policy [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1404.24s)]
*  in general are fourfold and they are clear. One, respect for sovereignty. Every nation [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1411.52s)]
*  deserves the right to determine its own destiny free from the interference of external powers. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1419.76s)]
*  Two, economic prosperity as a bridge to stability. Through economic partnerships and investment, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1427.84s)]
*  we can build a foundation for cooperation that transcends historical grievances. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1436.48s)]
*  Three, courageous diplomacy. Real progress requires difficult conversations and bold decisions. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1443.3600000000001s)]
*  And it is through these that trust is built and maintained. And finally, four, reciprocity. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1453.3600000000001s)]
*  Chad's saying what about Gaza? He's literally talking about Gaza, dude. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1462.24s)]
*  Why do you think he's saying that? You think he needs to say that for Israel? [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1466.32s)]
*  Everybody understands Israel as sovereignty. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1470.8s)]
*  We are done carrying the financial burden for nations that are unwilling to fund [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1492.72s)]
*  their own progress. The days of blank checks are over. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1498.64s)]
*  Partnerships under President Trump's leadership must be equitable and contributions must reflect [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1511.68s)]
*  shared commitments to our goals. In my work, I've seen firsthand how these principles resonate. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1519.76s)]
*  They provide a foundation that transcends politics and speaks to the shared humanity of all people [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1528.16s)]
*  in a region. Leaders across the Middle East recognized that this Trump administration [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1536.0s)]
*  is serious about results, not symbolic gestures, but real meaningful progress that improves lives. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1542.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1553.6000000000001s)]
*  It's not always easy. There are moments of deep challenge and frustration. Decades of mistrust [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1560.24s)]
*  cannot be undone overnight. Yet I take comfort in knowing that I am not in this alone. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1567.68s)]
*  President Trump's clarity of vision ensures that I never have to question what success looks like. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1574.0800000000002s)]
*  His leadership provides the confidence and direction necessary to navigate these complexities. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1581.52s)]
*  As we move forward, my commitment is to continue the work of advancing President Trump's vision [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1588.88s)]
*  for the Middle East. Whether through expanding the Abraham Peace Accords, fostering economic [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1594.96s)]
*  development, or facilitating dialogue between long-standing adversaries, my focus remains on [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1601.68s)]
*  actionable results. Let me close by saying this. A stable and prosperous Middle East [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1609.68s)]
*  is not an unattainable dream. It is a goal within our reach made possible by strong leadership and [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1617.36s)]
*  unwavering commitment. Under President Trump's guidance, we are proving that the impossible [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1628.7199999999998s)]
*  can become reality. Thank you, but I have one more thing to say. We have some special people [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1635.6799999999998s)]
*  for me to introduce you to tonight. President Trump has been talking to them as well. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1644.88s)]
*  They are the families of hostages from Israel who have been in Gaza for the last year and a half. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1651.0400000000002s)]
*  There are many of them here today. Several of the families have lost children and loved ones, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1660.24s)]
*  and they're here because they're part of an effort to retrieve their bodies so they can be buried in a [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1666.72s)]
*  proper way. Several have children who are still in captivity. There is an American family here [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1673.52s)]
*  whose loved one is scheduled to come out in 14 days. It is kind of crazy that the Biden [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1681.84s)]
*  admin set the stage for so much, for Israel to be propped up as this massive sovereign state [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1689.44s)]
*  that operates on its own. That Steve Witkoff, a random golf buddy of Donald Trump, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1701.76s)]
*  can sit up there and act like he overcame this Herculean task. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1711.12s)]
*  Okay, like, come on, dog. Let's have a, let's have a moment of honesty here. Like you just told them [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1718.16s)]
*  was what? That's it. The notion that like it is really difficult to get Israel to abide by [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1726.72s)]
*  the agreements that we set forth is so silly to me. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1735.76s)]
*  It's ridiculous. No Palestinian representative. Yeah, of course not, dude. Are you kidding me? [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1745.3600000000001s)]
*  I told you it's not like Donald Trump is a friend of the Palestinians. Never was and never will be. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1753.3600000000001s)]
*  Make no mistake. Whenever I talked about the situation, I told you, yes, in the interim period, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1759.44s)]
*  a moment of respite is still ultimately a good thing. But I am not holding my breath with the [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1766.0s)]
*  assumption that, you know, the future for Palestinians will be great under the Trump leadership. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1772.5600000000002s)]
*  It's not. I warned you that he'd most likely cut a side deal. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1777.28s)]
*  I told you that any kind of respite, any kind of long-standing ceasefire agreement is most likely [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1786.3999999999999s)]
*  being conducted so that Israel can recoup, recover, and rearm. But this does not mean that [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1794.08s)]
*  there shouldn't be a ceasefire. A ceasefire ultimately is still good. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1802.24s)]
*  But if you talk to anyone here and say, what was the difference between the deal on May 24 [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1805.76s)]
*  and what just happened here? They say nothing on paper. The only difference was Donald Trump. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1814.16s)]
*  I want to really highlight something that Steve Witkoff said there. He seemed to suggest that the [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1818.96s)]
*  American, one of the American hostages, possibly two who we believe to be part of this first phase. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1824.4s)]
*  Is the war in Ukraine over yet? No, he's got 24 more hours or 12 more hours. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1829.52s)]
*  Don't worry, chat. 12 more hours, chat. Don't worry. It's coming. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1835.92s)]
*  She was released much earlier, is still in Washington. So I haven't been able to check [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1845.44s)]
*  whether she was one of those on the stage, but an important moment. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1850.16s)]
*  ... of the United States, Donald J. Trump. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1852.8799999999999s)]
*  Ian Pennell, our thanks to you, Ian, who's covered this conflict from the very beginning. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1856.16s)]
*  He's got like six more hours, dude. He'll fix the... [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1865.76s)]
*  After greeting the families. He's got like six more hours to go, man. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1877.28s)]
*  I'm sure he'll pack up the whole Russia stuff. This arena is filled with supporters who gathered [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1881.36s)]
*  early this morning. Thank you very much, everybody. Appreciate it. Thank you. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1886.64s)]
*  So now the work begins. We won. We won, but now the work begins. We have to bring... [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1896.64s)]
*  Witkoff visiting Gaza to ensure the ceasefire deal is implemented. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1902.56s)]
*  Yeah, I saw that. But they're also opening up 2,000 pound munitions. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1906.24s)]
*  ... hostages, pardons. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1911.12s)]
*  They're going to continue giving extra munitions to Israel. Here, look at this. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1913.76s)]
*  And as soon as I leave, I'm going to the Oval Office and we'll be signing [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1918.08s)]
*  pardons for a lot of people. A lot of people. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1922.8s)]
*  And thank you to Steve Witkoff. He's a great guy. He's a friend of mine. He's been a very [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1929.04s)]
*  successful man. He's a great negotiator. He's a wonderful guy. People love him. And [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1933.36s)]
*  he's got a tremendous power of persuasion. And that's what we need. We don't need stiffs. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1938.4s)]
*  We don't need stiffs. We got a lot of stiffs. You just had... You just had a whole load of them. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1944.56s)]
*  And to the former hostages with us today, welcome. Welcome home. Some of the folks are [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1952.48s)]
*  former hostages. Not a good situation. The three young ladies that came home yesterday, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1958.56s)]
*  you saw that. More coming home every day now. They're coming home. But they were hurt. They [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1966.32s)]
*  were hurt. They were hurt. One had her head blown off. Fingers on her... [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1972.16s)]
*  Oh God, bro. Don't say that in front of them. Holy shit. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1978.88s)]
*  She was trying to defend herself from a bullet. Oh my God, bro. He is so crazy. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1982.72s)]
*  Knocked off her hand. I don't know. You look at it, it's a disgrace. We never stop. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1987.92s)]
*  Oh my God. We're so glad that you're reunited. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1993.44s)]
*  Bro, in front of the parents, dude. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1997.5200000000002s)]
*  Bless you all. And some of them are just saying, no, my son is gone. But please just bring home [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=1999.92s)]
*  his body. Right, Steve? Many of you have told me that. That your son is gone, but bring home [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2006.96s)]
*  his body. It should have never happened. Three years. It's ridiculous. It should have never [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2013.28s)]
*  happened. It wouldn't have happened. I also want to express my tremendous gratitude to the hundreds [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2020.08s)]
*  of thousands of proud American patriots who came from all across the country to join us in this [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2025.76s)]
*  celebration. It's a celebration of a big win. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2031.92s)]
*  And you're witnessing the dawn of the golden age of America. That's what it's going to be. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2043.2s)]
*  We're bringing it back. We're going to bring it back fast. We're going to bring it back fast. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2050.96s)]
*  Let us also thank the incredible service members, national guardsmen, police, secret service, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2055.84s)]
*  and law enforcement personnel for keeping us all safe. Even though they are great people. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2063.92s)]
*  New York's finest. I grew up with New York's finest. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2070.88s)]
*  Damn, bro. He is tired. Vibeshift. I feel like he... Does Trump no longer have the same [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2074.7200000000003s)]
*  motion and juice that he once did? He's EP, bro. He's EP. He's an EP guy. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2083.6s)]
*  I mean, he is 80. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2102.3199999999997s)]
*  Working men and women who made it possible. Those people. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2103.52s)]
*  It does make sense. Really talented, amazing people. I also want to thank my wonderful family [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2109.84s)]
*  for being here, especially my beautiful wife, our first lady, Melania. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2115.7599999999998s)]
*  They love our first lady. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2133.52s)]
*  Also, JD. How good is JD been? And his beautiful wife, Usha. How good is JB? JD has been great. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2140.56s)]
*  He's another good negotiator, Steve. He's a great negotiator, too. We need negotiators in this [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2154.08s)]
*  country. But so many of the people on the stage, we had, not as an example, [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2160.0s)]

*  First, I'll revoke nearly 80 destructive and radical executive actions of the previous [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2453.44s)]
*  administration. One of the worst administrations in history, maybe the one of them, the worst, [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2460.2400000000002s)]
*  anybody that would allow millions of people to pour through our borders from jails, prisons, [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2466.4s)]
*  mental institutions, insane asylums, gang members to be taken off the streets of Venezuela and [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2473.2000000000003s)]
*  deposit in our country and many not just Venezuela. You know, crime in Venezuela is down 74% [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2480.0800000000004s)]
*  because they took their criminals and gave them to us through an open border policy of the previous [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2487.52s)]
*  administration. All over the world, they're emptying their prisons into our country. They're [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2495.44s)]
*  emptying their mental institutions into our country. It stops as of one o'clock this afternoon. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2502.7999999999997s)]
*  Okay. So I'm revoking nearly 80 destructive, radical executive actions of the previous [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2511.04s)]
*  administration. They'll all be null and void within about what? Five minutes. Is that them over there? [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2524.64s)]
*  Five minutes. And next to gain immediate control of the vast federal out of control bureaucracy, [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2530.56s)]
*  I will implement an immediate regulation freeze, which will stop Biden bureaucrats from continuing [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2539.12s)]
*  to regulate. Most of those bureaucrats are being fired. They're gone. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2546.48s)]
*  Should be all of them, but some sneak through, but we have to live with a couple, I guess. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2557.84s)]
*  I'll also issue a temporary hiring freeze to ensure that we're [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2562.48s)]
*  only hiring competent people who are faithful to the American public. And we will pause the [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2566.8s)]
*  hiring of any new IRS agents. We will also require that federal workers must return to the office in [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2573.28s)]
*  person. I'm going to take the 88,000 people that they hired to go after you with guns. By the way, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2581.1200000000003s)]
*  they're allowed to use guns and harass you like they were so many other people. Remember this. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2589.76s)]
*  Okay. Remember we got to do remember a little statement about tips? Does anybody remember [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2597.28s)]
*  that little statement? I think we won Nevada because of that statement, but they went out [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2602.56s)]
*  and harass you over the tips. In other words, we are restoring control of our government to the [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2609.68s)]
*  people. We're going to take those 88,000. Let's see if they'd like to work on the border because [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2615.52s)]
*  that's what we want. I'm really under it. So we're going to have no tax on tips, right? [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2620.4s)]
*  No tax on tips. We may have like the speaker of the house. Is he here? He's done such a good job. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2632.24s)]
*  Is Mike here? Is he around here someplace? I saw him just a little while ago. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2642.4799999999996s)]
*  Hello, fellas. Look at you guys. I know it. He's great. He's doing great. They're all doing good. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2647.3599999999997s)]
*  The Republican party has never been unified like it is right now. They want to save our country. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2653.04s)]
*  We're going to more than save it. We're going to make it greater than it's ever been before by a [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2658.0s)]
*  lot. Next, I'm going to sign a presidential memorandum directory directing every member of [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2661.84s)]
*  my cabinet to marshal every power at their disposal to defeat inflation and rapidly bring [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2669.52s)]
*  down the cost of daily life because your costs have gone through the roof in the last four years. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2676.1600000000003s)]
*  Perhaps you didn't notice. Does anyone notice their costs are like double, triple, quadruple? [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2682.08s)]
*  You can't buy bacon. Apples have doubled in price. You want an apple? Anybody pay twice what you did [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2687.28s)]
*  two years ago? We'll put more money in your pocket and we'll bring back the American dream [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2694.0s)]
*  to reduce energy costs and liberate our economy so we have more oil and gas than any country in [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2700.1600000000003s)]
*  the world and we're going to use it. We're not going to do the wind thing. Big ugly windmills. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2708.0800000000004s)]
*  They ruin your neighborhood. They ruin you. If you have a house that's near a windmill, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2715.36s)]
*  guess what? Your house is worth less than half. And did you see up in New England with the whales? [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2719.1200000000003s)]
*  You see what's happening? So they had two whales killed in about 14 years. Last year and the year [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2724.96s)]
*  before total they had 28. So if you're into whales, you don't want windmills either. And they're the [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2731.04s)]
*  most expensive form of energy that you can have by far. And they're all made in China, by the way, [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2739.28s)]
*  practically all of them. And they kill your birds and they ruin your beautiful landscapes. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2746.96s)]
*  But other than that, I think they're quite good, right? [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2755.6800000000003s)]
*  Now remember when we used to joke and kid when we were kidding, but we don't kid anymore? They [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2759.76s)]
*  want to watch the debates on television. They want to watch your favorite president on television. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2765.92s)]
*  But the wind isn't blowing so we can't watch television that night, Gladys. Remember? Gladys, [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2771.28s)]
*  I'm sorry. The wind is just not blowing. We're not watching Trump tonight. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2778.2400000000002s)]
*  But I'm immediately withdrawing from the unfair one-sided Paris climate accord ripoff. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2783.6s)]
*  The United States will not sabotage your own industries while China pollutes with impunity. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2789.44s)]
*  You know, China, I mean, look, they use a lot of dirty energy, but they produce a lot of energy. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2800.48s)]
*  And when that stuff goes up in the air, you know, doesn't stay there. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2808.64s)]
*  It's not like you got a wall. We love walls, don't we? Not like you have a wall around and [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2812.88s)]
*  it just, it doesn't, it floats into the United States of America after three and a half to five [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2818.16s)]
*  and a half days. It floats across the oceans and it comes right over your neighborhood [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2823.3599999999997s)]
*  and it falls into your neighborhood. So they all say we have to fight for Alex. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2830.16s)]
*  Press brought up something really funny, but he has the families of the Israeli hostages on stage [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2835.52s)]
*  and he's talking about partying the January six hostages. And there is something very ironic [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2841.68s)]
*  about that under the Trump administration. And we didn't do anything to stop jobs and stop [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2848.0s)]
*  production. Believe me, you're going to see a lot of companies come pouring back because tariffs. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2854.64s)]
*  I always say tariffs is the most beautiful word to me in the dictionary. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2860.32s)]
*  Then I was reprimanded by the fake news. They said, what about love, religion and God? I said, [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2864.56s)]
*  I agree. Let's put God number one. Let's put religion number two. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2870.64s)]
*  I love, I don't know. We got to put that number three, I guess. Right. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2878.64s)]
*  And then it's tariff because tariffs are going to make us rich as hell. It's going to bring our [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2882.7999999999997s)]
*  countries businesses back that left us. And I'll also sign an executive order to immediately end [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2888.56s)]
*  federal government censorship of the American people in America. We believe in free speech [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2896.56s)]
*  and we're bringing it back starting today to stop the weaponization. No, do I know about that? These [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2903.04s)]
*  creeps deranged Jack Smith. Yeah, we have him deranged. He's a deranged prosecutor is sick. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2910.4s)]
*  They suck on me. He's now been reduced to apparently Alex also wrote about how [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2918.64s)]
*  he also referred to the Palestinians and Israeli prisons as hostages as well. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2930.0s)]
*  Did they pardon Jack Smith? You know that Biden, while I was making my speech, pardoned his whole [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2934.72s)]
*  family. The brother, the whole deal was pardoned. Can you imagine that? While I was making my speech, [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2942.08s)]
*  did everybody hear my speech? Did you like my speech? [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2959.12s)]
*  Thank you. I mean, the only thing wrong with it is I had a lot of tough things to say. And [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2972.08s)]
*  I have some great people that work for me, sir. This is such a great speech. It's so unifying. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2982.7999999999997s)]
*  Don't talk about Biden with Alex. Press did a misinformation. He's using the word. Oh, never mind. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2988.72s)]
*  I'm correcting the record. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=2996.64s)]
*  I just meant he's using the word hostage refer to political prisoners. He didn't say hostages [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3001.2s)]
*  about Palestinians. I was wrong. I was wrong because I was misguided by so-called quote unquote [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3004.8799999999997s)]
*  journalist, Alex press, unified like it is. It's so beautiful the way it is. And it is getting [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3012.7999999999997s)]
*  great reviews. The new administration has officially kickstarted and we're already doing [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3019.6s)]
*  misinformation. So already, I said, all right, I won't put it in my speech. But you know what? [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3024.88s)]
*  I'm speaking in front of a hell of a lot of people at a place called Capital One Arena. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3036.0s)]
*  And I'll talk about it. So we're going to, we're going to be going over the beautiful Oval Office, [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3042.2400000000002s)]
*  one of the great offices in history, even if it wasn't beautiful, it's the Oval Office, [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3050.56s)]
*  but it is beautiful. And we love the Oval Office. It all starts with the every the wars [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3054.4s)]
*  start and on and on. Everything starts and ends at the Oval Office. We love it. But we're going to [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3060.8s)]
*  go to the Oval Office. We're going to decide we're going to release our great hostages that didn't do [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3067.36s)]
*  for the most part. They didn't do stuff wrong. You see, take a look at what went on and look [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3075.28s)]
*  what happens in other parts of the country. In Portland, where they kill people, they destroy [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3081.2s)]
*  the city. Nothing happens to them. In Seattle, where they took over a big chunk of the city, [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3085.4399999999996s)]
*  nothing happened. Minneapolis, where they burned down the city. Nothing happened. Essentially, [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3091.2799999999997s)]
*  nothing happened. All they want to do is go after the J6 hostages. A 76 year old grandmother was [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3096.16s)]
*  arrested the other day because she was looking, I think because she was looking at the Capitol [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3103.8399999999997s)]
*  or something like that. Now, we're not going to put up with that crap anymore. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3108.16s)]
*  And to stop the weaponization of law enforcement, I've been investigated more than any human being [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3119.68s)]
*  in the world. I believe I have the all time record every day as a penis, a penis. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3125.8399999999997s)]
*  Every single day would get subpoenas. I was more than any person. Alphonse Capone, remember I used [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3131.84s)]
*  to talk about him? Now, Alphonse Capone Scarface, he was a pretty rough guy. I was investigating [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3140.2400000000002s)]
*  about 1 100th what Trump was, my father's looking down on me, my mother, how the hell did this [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3146.96s)]
*  happen? You know what it is? They investigated their political opponent, the opponent of Biden, [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3153.76s)]
*  and then ultimately Kamala. Has anyone ever heard of Kamala? [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3160.88s)]
*  We had to beat two opponents, you know, we had to beat Biden and we beat him. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3170.7200000000003s)]
*  Now he goes on top. The guy was like 39 points down. I think I could have beaten Trump. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3176.2400000000002s)]
*  They should have left me and I would have beaten him. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3183.76s)]
*  Now his debate performance wasn't the best, right? That's what killed them. And then they had a change [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3186.16s)]
*  and they, that's like you get into a fight. The great Dana White spoke last night. We love Dana [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3194.72s)]
*  White, right? UFC. That's like he puts in two fighters, one of them's getting creamed, getting [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3199.44s)]
*  really beaten and they say, all right, take him out, let's put somebody else in to finish up the [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3207.8399999999997s)]
*  fight. That's what they did to us. They gave us somebody new, but we took care of both of them. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3211.6s)]
*  So we beat actually two, we beat actually two opponents, but to stop the weaponization of law [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3216.64s)]
*  enforcement and our government, I will also sign an order directing every federal agency to preserve [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3223.7599999999998s)]
*  all records pertaining to political persecutions under the last administration of which there were [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3229.2799999999997s)]
*  many and beginning the process of exposing any and all abuses of power, even though he's pardoned [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3235.76s)]
*  many of these people. Can you believe it? He's pardoned them. You know why he did it while I [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3241.84s)]
*  was speaking because that way I couldn't speak about it. I was speaking. I didn't know he did it. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3247.44s)]
*  I finished my speech and they said, sir, he pardoned his whole family. I said, Oh, can I go back out [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3252.1600000000003s)]
*  there and talk about it? Somehow that wouldn't be very elegant. Our first lady would say, please [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3258.0s)]
*  don't do that. But we have plenty of time to talk about it and we will. We're doing all of this on [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3264.16s)]
*  our very first day in office. You know, don't forget we've been in this position really where [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3272.16s)]
*  we won the primaries in record time. We were the fastest win of a primary ever in political history, [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3277.92s)]
*  which is a very nice thing. It's nice to know. Well, the second election was rigged, so we knew [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3284.7999999999997s)]
*  we were doing well. But if it wasn't, I would have never run. I would have never run. But this [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3291.2s)]
*  third one was just a monster. Boy, was that a big one, huh? That was a big one. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3298.08s)]
*  On the second one, we got like 10 or 12 million votes more than the first one. How about that? [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3305.3599999999997s)]
*  We did great on the first one. We did much better on the second one, but bad did we do [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3309.7599999999998s)]
*  well on the third one. So we're going to have some fun. It's very simple. We're going to make [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3315.36s)]
*  our country great. We're going to make our country great again. We're going to make America great [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3322.4s)]
*  again. How good a name is MAGA though, right? You know? I was going to say keep America great, [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3327.04s)]
*  but unfortunately it wasn't great. Can't say keep it great. It will be great again. But CAG, [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3336.6400000000003s)]
*  keep America great, CAG. I don't think it's ever going to replace MAGA. Does anybody like CAG? [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3342.7999999999997s)]
*  I don't think so. It's never replacing MAGA. Nothing will ever replace MAGA. MAGA was the most [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3348.16s)]
*  successful political operation, political movement in the history of our country, [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3355.2s)]
*  maybe in the history of the world. Let's see what happens because we're not finished yet. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3362.72s)]
*  We're not finished yet. It's not so good, CAG, but we're doing this in the very first day in office. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3368.48s)]
*  And in just a few moments, I'm not only signing the release of the J six hostages, I'm signing [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3375.68s)]
*  other things that you're going to love. Oh, you're going to be happy reading newspapers tomorrow. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3383.52s)]
*  And the next day and the next day and the next day, he's keeping the Israeli family hostages [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3387.68s)]
*  hostage again, you know, hostage on stage. He's holding them hostage too. You don't have any [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3392.3199999999997s)]
*  empty seats. And by the way, the capital one owners, they are so good while talking about the [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3401.8399999999997s)]
*  real hostages, January six. And I just want to thank Ted and everybody. You guys have been [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3409.9199999999996s)]

*  They're doing great. So I want to thank them. Capital one arena owners. They have been [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3423.44s)]
*  absolutely fantastic. And thank you once again to everyone. And I can only tell you, you're going [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3429.04s)]
*  to be very happy. You're going to watch a lot of good things happen. We've got to stop some wars [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3434.64s)]
*  that are happening and going on some stupid things are happening. The war with Ukraine [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3438.64s)]
*  would have never happened. And it has, as you know, Israel would have never been hit on October [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3443.36s)]
*  7th. And, Oh no, he's turning to them. None of you would even know anything about this tragedy [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3450.4s)]
*  that you're going through right now. But Iran was broke. Anybody that bought oil from Iran, [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3455.6s)]
*  they couldn't do any business with us. You're not going to do business with America. China passed, [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3463.04s)]
*  everybody passed. They were broke. They didn't have money for Hamas. They didn't have money for [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3468.0s)]
*  Hezbollah. And your sons would be alive and they certainly wouldn't be incarcerated like they are. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3472.24s)]
*  It's a shame, but we're, we're getting a lot of people out in a short period of time. So I'm going [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3478.56s)]

*  Capitol one arena, shaking hands with families of the hostages. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3499.2s)]
*  Many of those families have given Donald Trump credit in recent days saying they do not think [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3507.04s)]
*  that this ceasefire, this deal would have gotten across the finish line had it not been [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3512.8799999999997s)]
*  for Donald Trump versus Mideast envoy teaming up with the Biden administration in those final days. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3517.2s)]
*  They have said that they believe it was the addition of Donald Trump and his team [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3524.3199999999997s)]
*  that made this happen. Donald Trump saying he will head over to that table with a number of executive [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3528.7999999999997s)]
*  actions already laid out on the table in the presidential seal. Mary Bruce, [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3536.08s)]
*  do we have an understanding of exactly what it is he's signing right here? [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3540.3199999999997s)]
*  Now, but we, but we do know that this is going to be a tremendous effort for him to show straight [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3545.6s)]
*  out the gate just how aggressive he is being as he has been touting all day. We know that he is [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3550.7999999999997s)]
*  signing a wide range of executive orders ranging from rescinding any DEI or gender related directives [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3555.84s)]
*  from the Biden administration to designating cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3562.08s)]

*  and others. Wait, you can do that with one signature? That's crazy. Bold, radical. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3574.4s)]
*  With the strength of the President and Donald Trump there, President Trump now trying effectively to undo as much as he can. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3586.6400000000003s)]
*  The second item of President Trump is a regulatory freeze as you announced in your speech preventing [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3592.8s)]
*  bureaucrats from issuing any more regulations until we have full control of this, the government and this administration. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3598.0s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3615.84s)]
*  The next item, sir, is a freeze on all federal hiring, accepting the military and a number of [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3628.96s)]
*  other excluded categories again until our full control of the government is achieved and we [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3634.6400000000003s)]
*  understand the objectives of government going forward. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3639.36s)]
*  Could you imagine Biden doing this? I don't think so. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3646.32s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3657.44s)]
*  Sir, the next item as you announced in your speech is a requirement that federal workers return to [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3661.76s)]
*  full-time in-person work immediately. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3668.7200000000003s)]
*  Why are they clapping for that? Like, what does that do? No, honestly, like not even like good or bad. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3671.44s)]
*  I'm not making a value judgment here, but why would that be something worthy of clapping? [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3680.32s)]
*  Like, what does that do for any of the people in the room? Yeah, finally my bitch ass dad has to go [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3686.2400000000002s)]
*  back to work and work from the office. Like, what is that? Is cost of living crisis that has cost [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3694.2400000000002s)]
*  Americans so dearly? Also, what? This executive order is so stupid. He's going to address it. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3698.72s)]
*  He's going to address the living crisis, cost of living crisis. Oh, hell yeah. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3710.3199999999997s)]

*  Another thing where it's like, why are you clapping for that? Good or bad? [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3724.72s)]
*  And this one is objectively like ridiculous, but clapping for that is so stupid. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3728.32s)]
*  Easy not to worry about the living crisis when you're a millionaire. Are you talking about me? [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3747.92s)]
*  Are you stupid? Do you think signing an executive order saying that you're going to address the cost [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3751.92s)]
*  of living crisis is actually going to address the cost of living crisis? Because I'm not talking [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3757.36s)]
*  about the validity of the cost of living crisis that much is, you know, apparent. I'm saying he's [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4msRiXwoo&t=3763.36s)]
