# Kamala Harris's Crazy Interview With MSNBC | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [September 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA)
*  Having said that, however, obviously Kamala Harris, I have no confidence in. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=0.0s)]
*  So I do believe she's probably hitting that from the NIMBY perspective or not NIMBY, sorry, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=4.22s)]
*  YIMBY perspective. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=8.9s)]
*  I you guys know for me, it's like make the federal government compete. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=11.14s)]
*  OK, we need deflation. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=16.18s)]
*  I say America bad, but this is exactly how America bad and why I say America bad. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=19.06s)]
*  Anyway, we're quickly going to move on to the Kamala Harris interview that's taking [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=31.1s)]
*  place on MSNBC. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=35.739999999999995s)]
*  OK, I'm going to try that one more time with Stephanie rule after Stephanie rule came out [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=36.739999999999995s)]
*  and said she supports people voting left us on film. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=42.3s)]
*  I'm going to try that one more time with Stephanie rule after Stephanie rule came out and said [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=46.86s)]
*  she supports people voting left us on film. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=49.86s)]

*  and said she supports people voting left us on film. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=99.26s)]
*  I love how stupid this level of argumentation is. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=102.66000000000001s)]
*  It was stupid when Brandon was saying it and it's increased. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=105.66000000000001s)]
*  It's still stupid when Kamala said. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=108.66000000000001s)]
*  And invite a recession by the middle of next year. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=110.66000000000001s)]
*  So the facts remain. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=113.66000000000001s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=114.66000000000001s)]
*  That Donald Trump has a history of taking power. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=115.66000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump has a history of taking power. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=118.66s)]
*  Donald Trump has a history of taking power. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=121.66000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump has a history of taking power. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=124.66000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump has a history of taking power. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=127.66000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump has a history of taking care of very rich people. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=131.06s)]
*  And I'm not mad at anybody for being rich, but they should pay their fair share. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=134.06s)]
*  But tax cuts for the billionaires and the top corporations in our country. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=139.06s)]
*  And then not really paying much attention to middle class families. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=145.06s)]
*  My perspective on the economy is when you grow the middle class, America's economy is stronger. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=150.06s)]
*  And there's empirical evidence to prove my point. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=155.06s)]
*  Correct. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=157.06s)]
*  Then let me ask you about taxes. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=158.46s)]
*  Because lots of people will say, I don't like Donald Trump, but he cut my taxes. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=160.46s)]
*  He didn't just cut corporate taxes, he cut individual taxes. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=164.46s)]
*  Now that expires next year. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=167.46s)]
*  And there's some people confused saying, I don't know what's going to happen next year. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=169.46s)]
*  Under a Harris administration, at what income level should someone expect their taxes to go up? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=172.46s)]
*  And that state and local tax deduction that's currently capped and matters to a lot of people in blue states. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=179.46s)]
*  Are you going to lift that cap? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=185.46s)]
*  First of all, when it relates to anybody making less than $400,000 a year, your taxes will not go up. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=187.86s)]
*  Your taxes will not go up. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=193.86s)]
*  And in fact, under my plan, taxes, that means you're going to make the Trump tax cuts permanent, including $6,000 a year for, for young couples for the first year of the, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=195.86s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=207.86s)]
*  She's going to make the tax Trump tax cuts that are supposed to sunset. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=208.86s)]
*  She's going to make them permanent. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=211.86s)]
*  Is that because during the first year of a young couple of a person's child's life, they're going to need help buying a crib, buying a car seat. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=213.26000000000002s)]
*  And we all benefit when they're actually able to do what they naturally want to do to take care of their child. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=224.26000000000002s)]
*  And expanding that child tax credit, or you mentioned housing before giving that extra money for a first home. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=229.26000000000002s)]
*  If you can't raise corporate taxes or if GOP takes control of the Senate, where do you get the money to do that? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=235.26000000000002s)]
*  Do you still go forward with those plans and borrow? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=242.66s)]
*  Well, but we're going to have to raise corporate taxes and we're going to have to raise. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=244.66s)]
*  It's not new, but she's never said it was in the context of like Trump tax cuts, the tax cuts sunsetting. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=249.66s)]
*  And billionaires pay their fair share. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=254.66s)]
*  That's just it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=257.65999999999997s)]
*  It's about paying their fair share. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=258.65999999999997s)]
*  I am not mad at anyone for achieving success, but everyone should pay their fair share. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=260.65999999999997s)]
*  It is not right that the teachers and the firefighters that I meet every day across our country are paying a higher tax than the richest people in our country. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=267.06s)]
*  Bill Gates just said it this week. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=276.06s)]
*  If he was in charge of taxes, he would have paid more. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=278.06s)]
*  But how do you find that line to make sure corporations are paying their fair share, but they're not leaving our country? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=280.06s)]
*  Well, listen, I work with a lot of CEOs. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=287.06s)]
*  I have spent a lot of time with CEOs and I'm going to tell you that the business leaders who are actually part of the engine of America's economy agree that people should pay their fair share. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=289.46s)]
*  They also agree that when we look at a plan such as mine that is about investing in the middle class, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=300.46s)]
*  investing in new industries, investing in bringing down costs, invest in entrepreneurs like small businesses, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=306.46s)]
*  that the overall economy is stronger and everyone benefits. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=314.46s)]
*  Part of my plan for the economy is investing in new industries in a way that we have active partnership with the private sector. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=318.85999999999996s)]
*  I've worked with the private sector my entire career. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=327.85999999999996s)]
*  Even as Vice President, working with some of the biggest banks and biggest tech companies to increase by billions of dollars the money going into community banks, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=331.85999999999996s)]
*  to increase access to capital for small businesses. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=339.85999999999996s)]
*  Why do those biggest corporations and CEOs do that? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=344.26s)]
*  Because they know those kinds of investments like in our small businesses, in startups and entrepreneurs, actually strengthens America's economy overall and everyone benefits. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=347.26s)]
*  So this is not about bilking anybody, but it just... [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=357.26s)]
*  Bro, Stephanie Ruhl is eating this. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=359.26s)]
*  It's dog shit and she's eating it. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=361.26s)]
*  For everyone to grow wealth. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=363.26s)]
*  I believe that it is not sufficient and it should not be our goal to just make sure everyone is working. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=365.26s)]
*  That should be the baseline. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=372.65999999999997s)]
*  That should be a given. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=373.65999999999997s)]
*  And let's create an economy where people have the ability to buy a home, to start a business, to take a nice vacation from time to time. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=374.65999999999997s)]
*  Right? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=382.65999999999997s)]
*  For people who want to buy a home, yes, getting a $25,000 kicker would be great. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=383.65999999999997s)]
*  But it's not just affording a home. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=388.65999999999997s)]
*  We don't have enough in this country. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=390.65999999999997s)]
*  You're absolutely right. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=392.65999999999997s)]
*  And one of the main problems are regulations and rules, strict, strict rules at a local level. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=393.65999999999997s)]
*  How does the federal government cut through all that red tape and get down to the suburbs of Pittsburgh and say, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=400.06s)]
*  we're going to have to build some affordable housing here? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=407.06s)]
*  How do you connect the two? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=409.06s)]
*  So you're absolutely right. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=411.06s)]
*  So across our country, people rightly are concerned about the cost of housing. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=413.06s)]
*  So it's homeownership to your point. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=417.06s)]
*  We need more supply. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=419.06s)]
*  That is, without any question, part of the solution. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=421.06s)]
*  Creating more supply under my plan includes creating tax incentives to work with the private sector and home builders. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=424.06s)]
*  Part of my goal and the plan would be to create three million new housing units for rent and for ownership by the end of my first term. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=430.06s)]
*  It includes also what we must do to cut red tape. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=438.06s)]
*  You're absolutely right. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=441.06s)]
*  It takes far too long and there's too much bureaucracy associated with home building. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=442.06s)]
*  And I say that as a devout public servant. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=446.56s)]
*  I know that we have to reduce the red tape and speed up what we need to do around building. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=449.66s)]
*  And that is going to require working from the federal level with state and local governments. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=456.46s)]
*  And it's going to be different in different places, depending on the needs of that community, the needs of that local government, that municipality. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=461.46s)]
*  But working in consultation and coordination and also around incentives that we can create. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=469.46s)]
*  For example, some of the work is going to be through what we do in terms of giving benefits and assistance to state and local governments around transit dollars. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=474.46s)]
*  And looking holistically at the connection between that and housing and looking holistically at the incentives we in the federal government can create for local and state governments to actually engage in planning in holistic manner. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=484.46s)]
*  That includes prioritizing affordable housing. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=498.46s)]
*  She's still way too much of a fucking urbanist for my liking, but I like it. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=501.46s)]
*  Coming up, much more of Stephanie Ruhl's exclusive interview with Vice President Kamala Harris. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=503.46s)]
*  I mean, I like the way she communicated that last aspect because obviously public transit is directly tied. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=506.46s)]
*  It's hand in hand with housing. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=513.46s)]
*  If you increase, for example, housing density and change the readily available housing supply to like higher density urban housing, you're going to need to improve public transit. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=516.46s)]
*  So like things of that nature are pretty solid. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=527.46s)]
*  And it's not just like the most annoying urbanist yin-bes that are aware of these realities. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=530.46s)]
*  Having said that, however, obviously Kamala Harris, I have no confidence in. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=536.46s)]
*  So I do believe she's probably hitting that from the NIMBY perspective or not NIMBY. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=541.46s)]
*  Sorry, YIMBY perspective. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=545.46s)]
*  I you guys know for me, it's like make the federal government compete. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=547.46s)]
*  OK, we need deflation on housing. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=553.46s)]
*  We need the housing bubble to pop. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=557.46s)]
*  So what that needs in an effort to do that, you need to create an alternative, a government subsidized alternative, not government subsidies of the public private partnership, but like directly a federal jobs program that actually constructs these housing units all around the country state by state if you would like to do so. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=559.46s)]
*  And then that housing development project should also be socialized housing, social housing, public housing. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=578.46s)]
*  This is the way that the government competes with the private marketplace and still utilizes the capitalist market measures in an effort to ensure that there is some kind of sustainability in terms of pricing. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=585.46s)]
*  OK, of course, Kamala Harris will never do that. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=597.46s)]
*  That's not going to happen. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=600.46s)]
*  And her alternative to the current unsustainable model that we have that is that is created is so much homelessness is simply deregulation and tax incentives for big real estate developers. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=601.46s)]
*  I personally consider this an awful way to try and solve a problem. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=616.46s)]
*  I don't think this will solve the problem at all. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=621.46s)]
*  They will sit on those tax incentives. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=624.46s)]
*  They will not complete those housing projects. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=626.46s)]
*  And all of this will go to waste. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=629.46s)]
*  Inevitably, is that matters a lot to this town. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=631.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=634.46s)]
*  U.S. Steel. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=635.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=636.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=637.46s)]
*  When you think Pennsylvania, when you think Pittsburgh, you got the Liberty Bell in Philly and get U.S. Steel in Pittsburgh. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=638.46s)]
*  That's right. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=641.46s)]
*  A Japanese company wants to buy them. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=642.46s)]
*  You are opposed to this idea. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=644.46s)]
*  Many people are. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=646.46s)]
*  But if the deal doesn't go through, they have said people could lose jobs. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=648.46s)]
*  They could close mills. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=652.46s)]
*  They could leave the state of Pennsylvania. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=653.46s)]
*  I mean, that is like moving the Liberty Bell to Newark. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=655.46s)]
*  So which is more important? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=657.46s)]
*  It's most important that we also whenever she's talking about housing, how the fuck do you not bring up rent caps? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=659.46s)]
*  What happened in manufacturing of steel by American? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=666.46s)]
*  Oh, I'll tell you what happened. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=669.46s)]
*  She dropped it, which includes again, I'll tell you what. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=672.46s)]
*  She's not dropping the price of rent about the economy overall investing in new industries. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=676.46s)]
*  There is not a new industry. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=681.46s)]
*  This is why I'm voting for Joe Biden. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=682.46s)]
*  Mr. Mr. I'm going to decrease rent. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=684.46s)]
*  I'm going to put a rent cap at fifty five dollars a month. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=687.46s)]
*  That's why that's why I'm writing in Biden's name in an American company. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=690.46s)]
*  Manufacturing that steel for those new industries is going to be critically important, not only in terms of our economy, but also in the context of national security. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=695.46s)]
*  Most people now realize if we didn't before the pandemic and the strain on supply chains and an overreliance on foreign manufacturing, that we have to be intentional about U.S. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=705.46s)]
*  based manufacturing and of the products that we have to prioritize. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=719.46s)]
*  Steel is one of them. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=726.46s)]
*  And that's always going to be my priority. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=727.46s)]
*  Steel workers matter in this country. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=729.46s)]
*  Unions matter. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=732.46s)]
*  Yes. In 2016, Donald Trump connected with unions. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=733.46s)]
*  He saw them increase. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=738.46s)]
*  There was an [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=740.46s)]
*  Lower rent prices. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=742.46s)]
*  I think it will lower rent prices a little bit. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=743.46s)]
*  It's an inevitability. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=746.46s)]
*  I just don't even think that they will actually increase the supply of housing, though. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=747.46s)]
*  I don't believe it. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=751.46s)]
*  And they will not punish it like the PPP loans. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=752.46s)]
*  Ain't nobody got punished for that. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=755.46s)]
*  And virtually zero people got punished for it. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=758.46s)]
*  Just like all of these tax, all these tax cuts that you'll get in order to attempt to build a house will get mucked up in the process. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=761.46s)]
*  This is something that I know very well as a California resident. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=772.46s)]
*  OK, this is how it goes in California. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=777.46s)]
*  Investing in new industries and working actively with the private sector to grow our economy. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=780.46s)]
*  But I'm asking because there's this idea we want something more from her. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=786.46s)]
*  What is it? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=790.46s)]
*  Well, here's the thing that back to your point about previous election cycles. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=791.46s)]
*  Donald Trump made a whole lot of promises that he did not meet and one would argue broke. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=795.46s)]
*  Look at Lordstown. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=801.46s)]
*  He said he was going to sell your homes. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=803.46s)]
*  Yeah, don't sell your homes. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=805.46s)]
*  And what happened? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=806.46s)]
*  It shut down. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=807.46s)]
*  Outsourcing under Donald Trump, his policies that are about putting, you know, tens to hundreds of percent tariffs. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=808.46s)]
*  John Deere. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=817.46s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=818.46s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=819.46s)]
*  So part of the challenge, and I don't disagree that it's a challenge, got to earn the vote of everybody, is reminding people of fact, regardless of what somebody says in a small rally somewhere. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=820.46s)]
*  And I think that's really important. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=834.46s)]
*  And that's part of what I'm doing in this campaign is to remind people, just like here in Pittsburgh, of the reality of who has stood with union labor, who stands for American manufacturing, who stands for American jobs. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=836.46s)]
*  Can I ask you about tariffs? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=849.46s)]
*  Because you just mentioned it. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=851.46s)]
*  It's not just with one company. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=852.46s)]
*  Donald Trump's sort of big idea is this broad-based tariffs across the board. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=854.46s)]
*  You and many others have said that would be not only disastrous, but it would be a direct tax on the American consumer. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=858.46s)]
*  It would be a sales tax on the American people. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=865.46s)]
*  The independent economists have already measured this by the sales tax of doing a 20 percent tariffs on all imports that he has described would be a 20 percent sales tax, in essence, on basic necessities for the average American worker, average American family, totaling almost $4,000 a year. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=868.46s)]
*  That is no small matter. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=891.46s)]
*  Here in Pittsburgh, when I'm talking to a group of folks who work here, who live here, and when they hear it might be $4,000 more a year for them, look, people can't afford that. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=892.46s)]
*  But tariffs aren't unique. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=904.46s)]
*  President Biden has tariffs in place. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=905.46s)]
*  He's actually looking to potentially implement more. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=907.46s)]
*  Where do you come out on? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=910.46s)]
*  Is there a good tariff, a bad tariff? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=912.46s)]
*  Well, part of it is you don't just throw around the idea of just tariffs across the board. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=914.46s)]
*  And that's part of the problem with Donald Trump. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=919.46s)]
*  Frankly, I'm going to say this in all sincerity. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=921.46s)]
*  He's just not very serious about how he thinks about some of these issues. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=925.46s)]
*  And one must be serious. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=929.46s)]
*  He's like, we're going to do good tariffs. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=931.46s)]
*  He's doing bad tariffs is such a funny Trumpian ass line. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=932.46s)]
*  Some talking point ending in an exclamation at a political rally, but actually putting the thought into what will be the return on the investment. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=935.46s)]
*  What will be the economic impact on everyday people? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=944.46s)]
*  And when you look at my plans, you will see what those benefits will be. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=947.46s)]
*  $25,000 down payment assistance for first time home buyers. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=952.46s)]
*  You know what that means? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=956.46s)]
*  Then you're creating the ability of that working person to build intergenerational dollars for homeowners. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=957.46s)]
*  Doing the work of a $6,000 child tax credit, doing the work of a $50,000 tax deduction for first time, small businesses, startups, because right now it's a real plan. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=963.46s)]
*  It's a real plan because right now, and again, it's about paying attention to the detail and being serious about it. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=975.46s)]
*  I'm serious about my enthusiasm and my for small businesses and my belief in what they will do as part of America's economic engine. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=980.46s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=988.46s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=989.46s)]
*  No. So looking at the fact that right now the tax deduction is $5,000. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=990.46s)]
*  It's good for a lot of people that are right around the corner, but probably not in the long run because it will just make houses $25,000 more. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=993.46s)]
*  The innovation and the ambition of the ideas that are present and among us, but need the fuel to be able to actually achieve the goal. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1004.46s)]
*  His plan is not serious when you lay it out like that, but a serious problem over the last few years has been inflation. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1014.46s)]
*  Luckily, it's cooling, but prices are still hot. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1020.46s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1023.46s)]
*  You said you want to take this on by going after those who engage in price gouging. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1024.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1029.46s)]
*  But as somebody who supports free markets, who's a capitalist, how do you go after price gouging without implementing price controls? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1030.46s)]
*  Because once we get in this zone, people start to get worried and they say, I don't know what she stands for. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1039.46s)]
*  So just to be very frank, I am never going to apologize for going after companies and corporations that take advantage of the desperation of the American people. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1044.46s)]
*  And as attorney general, I saw this happen in the midst of an emergency, whether it be an extreme weather event or even the pandemic. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1055.46s)]
*  We saw it where those few companies, not the majority, not most, but those few companies that would take advantage of the desperation of people and jack up prices. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1063.46s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to go after them. Yes, I'm going to go after them. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1075.46s)]
*  And that is part of a much more comprehensive plan on what we can do to bring down the cost of living, including housing, including the everyday needs of the American people. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1078.46s)]
*  Coming up more of Stephanie rules interview with Vice President Kamala Harris, where she addresses Trump's claim. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1089.46s)]
*  Yes, she's glazing super hard. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1094.46s)]
*  Okay. Stephanie rule is glazing column. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1096.46s)]
*  One argument I've seen against the notion of price will go up 25 cases. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1099.46s)]
*  Sellers don't know or care whether the buyer is going to get the tax credit. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1101.46s)]
*  All they know is the down payment and the mortgage money and not everyone will qualify for the full amount of any. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1107.46s)]
*  Yeah, that doesn't matter. What matters is they see the $25,000 in tax credit and they go, oh, there's opportunity for us to increase the price. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1111.46s)]
*  The way to actually lower the price is by creating more housing units. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1120.46s)]
*  How you do that matters. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1125.46s)]
*  Kamala Harris wants to do that through deregulation, which I don't like. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1127.46s)]
*  She wants to do that by offering taxing incentives to real estate developers, which I also do not like. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1131.46s)]
*  Okay. I think that the private public partnership is a demonstrable failure in the state of California. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1136.46s)]
*  Kamala Harris, a California Democrat. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1143.46s)]
*  It is, I guess, expected for her to behave in a California Democrat style way, which is usually lip service and people voting for really progressive housing market reform. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1145.46s)]
*  Only to get nothing in return, like never actually get said housing market reform implemented because of that very same public private partnership that we were talking about. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1160.46s)]
*  It's always the private developers that just kind of go, ah, thanks for the tax cuts. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1170.46s)]
*  We just couldn't finish this project. Sorry. We really wanted to. We just couldn't. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1175.46s)]
*  And now we're going to be using the tax cuts and the unfinished projects as a way to lower our taxable burden even further. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1179.46s)]
*  After all, this is just eating away at our pockets. I don't know. It's just one way that I'm thinking. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1188.46s)]
*  Why would a developer personally not finish a project? I don't know. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1192.46s)]
*  Literally ask any dude, dude. Great question, dog. I don't know. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1194.46s)]
*  I don't know. Why are there so many empty plots in the state of California that we're supposed to be building like homeless shelters and OK, or additional housing units? [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1200.46s)]
*  I don't know. That's a great question. That's why I said they do it all the time. Don't ask me. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1210.46s)]
*  I don't know. You think seriously regulations won't slow down the building of houses. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1216.46s)]
*  Regulations have an absolute stranglehold on progress like the middle of the hour ad break as unsubscribe viewers putting on my lib hopium hat could have been having a [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1220.46s)]
*  California demos podas at least be a good stepping stone in destigmatizing progressive posturing nationally. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1229.46s)]
*  No, because she's not even doing progressive posturing nationally. What the megaphonics when guys what out of Kamala Harris's policies with some exceptions is like a genuinely progressive policy. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1234.46s)]
*  We're talking about like 90s Republican Party ass attitudes in terms of like building new housing units by giving tax cuts to real estate developers and and beyond that you're not destigmatizing California progressivism. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1249.46s)]
*  You're not because this is not California progressivism. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1266.46s)]
*  Also, this is the worst aspects of California progressivism. If you're thinking about like Gavin Newsom and that's gross and awful anyway, it's just pure neoliberalism. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1269.46s)]
*  Anyway, right before this interview, MSNBC had a panel where someone was arguing that Harris needs to pander more to the left than to the Nikki Haley Republicans who will vote for Republicans. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1278.46s)]
*  Damn, who was that? That's crazy. I work in the home building industry. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1287.46s)]
*  Every project is done by a separate LLC set up just for that project and they contract the construction of the home building company. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1291.46s)]
*  That way they can just shutter the LLC and walk away if the project goes wrong or if they if it won't have the right profits. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1297.46s)]
*  Every matter of like legislation, every part of our legislative agenda revolves around tax cuts for corporations and deregulation or the opportunity economy. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1302.46s)]
*  Okay, one of these is an economic one and no one is eating cats and dogs in Springfield, Ohio. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1314.46s)]
*  And I'm glad not to be talking about that. But there are people there that are stressed, that feel that they're at capacity. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1320.46s)]
*  Communities around the country that have legal immigration, many have said we're we're at capacity and many feel like the government has said to them, well, adapt, sit down, be quiet. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1327.46s)]
*  This is how it is. What would a Harris administration do for those communities who've taken in many, many legal immigrants but are at capacity? [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1338.46s)]
*  Well, first of all, we do have a broken immigration system and it needs to be fixed. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1347.46s)]
*  And if we take a step back, months ago, some of the most conservative members of the United States Congress came together with the proposed a border security bill that would have put 1500 new border age. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1353.46s)]
*  Please look at any of these Rustbell states, man. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1365.46s)]
*  Order agents who are there right now working around the clock would have put more money into stemming the flow of fentanyl, which is Americans around our country and devastating communities would have put more resources into our ability to prosecute transnational organizations, which in my career, I've prosecuted. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1367.46s)]
*  Donald Trump got word of the bill, realized it was going to fix a problem he wanted to run on and told them to the bill. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1384.46s)]
*  Don't put it up for a vote. He built a bill that would have actually been a solution because he wants to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1390.46s)]
*  And that's part of what needs to be addressed. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1397.46s)]
*  And my pledge is that when elected president, if the American people will have me, I will bring that bill back and I will sign it into law. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1399.46s)]
*  And we need a comprehensive plan that includes what we need to do to fortify not only our border, but deal with the fact that we also need to create pathways for people to earn citizenship. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1407.46s)]
*  And I want to just ask you about a little job and a big job. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1419.46s)]
*  The first one, just a fact check. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1422.46s)]
*  Because your opponent almost every day. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1424.46s)]
*  There's no such thing as a little job. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1426.46s)]
*  Fair, fair. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1428.46s)]
*  Because your opponent almost every day seems to be talking about this. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1429.46s)]
*  So I just want to ask you yes or no. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1433.46s)]
*  At any point in your life, have you served two all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, sesame seed bun, working at a McDonald's? Yes or no? That's it. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1434.46s)]
*  I have. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1445.46s)]
*  Okay. Now the other job. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1446.46s)]
*  Now the other job. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1447.46s)]
*  But it was not a small job. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1448.46s)]
*  I did the prize. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1450.46s)]
*  I mean, you know, yes. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1451.46s)]
*  Okay, but a small period of time. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1453.46s)]
*  But then let me ask about a big job. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1454.46s)]
*  But to your point, if you don't mind, before you get to the big job. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1455.46s)]
*  Part of the reason I even talk about having worked at McDonald's is because there are people who work at McDonald's in our country who are trying to raise a family. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1458.46s)]
*  I worked there as a student. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1469.46s)]
*  I was a kid who worked there trying to raise families and pay rent on that. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1470.46s)]
*  And I think part of the difference between me and my opponent includes our perspective on the needs of the American people and what our responsibility then is to meet those needs. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1475.46s)]
*  Then to the big job. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1487.46s)]
*  You have laid out policy in great detail. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1489.46s)]
*  But the economy is an unpredictable beast. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1493.46s)]
*  And you are running for a job that takes extraordinary instinct and guts. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1497.46s)]
*  What's the last time you were to make a gut decision? [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1502.46s)]
*  This here is very prescribed. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1504.46s)]
*  It's very controlled. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1506.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1507.46s)]
*  Probably the biggest gut decision I've made most recently is to choose my running mate. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1508.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1514.46s)]
*  There were lots of good, incredible candidates. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1515.46s)]
*  And ultimately that came down to a gut decision. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1518.46s)]
*  I know I'm out of time, but then I just want to ask you a question from my gut. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1521.46s)]
*  Okay. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1524.46s)]
*  Because today we're talking about the economy. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1525.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1528.46s)]
*  And people don't think often about reproductive rights being an economic issue, but it is a woman's ability to plan her future, her education, her life. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1529.46s)]
*  Today and in the last few days, Donald Trump keeps talking about it and how in overturning Roe v. Wade, he helped women. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1540.46s)]
*  He protected women. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1546.46s)]
*  He says they're miserable today. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1547.46s)]
*  They're poorer today. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1549.46s)]
*  They're more vulnerable today. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1550.46s)]
*  He said he will be the protector of women if elected. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1552.46s)]
*  Can you respond to that? [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1557.46s)]
*  So Donald Trump is also the person who said women should be punished for exercising a decision that they rightly should be able to make about their own body and their future. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1558.46s)]
*  So I think we would all agree that as a result of that perspective that he has about women, he also then chose three members of the United States Supreme Court who did as he intended, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1569.46s)]
*  Undid the protections of Roe v. Wade. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1582.46s)]
*  And now in state after state, you see laws being passed that do punish an alternative universe. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1584.46s)]
*  Bernie Sanders gets this level of writing and glazing for his policies. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1590.46s)]
*  And America is like universally on board with Medicare for all and many other issues that Bernie spoke to. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1594.46s)]
*  And basically, you know, we bring about the new New Deal era for the Democratic Party and the Democrats end up beefing up labor unions and going in the opposite direction of the grand bargain or the third way or neoliberalism. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1602.46s)]
*  And they just win so hard and the momentum of like openly socialist or social democratic politicians is so great that there's an entirely new youth wing of the Democratic movement. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1619.46s)]
*  And, you know, and that's where we're at, except that's not where we're at. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1636.46s)]
*  Wake up. We're in this part interview. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1641.46s)]
*  And I thought you pressed her on really important stuff. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1644.46s)]
*  It was it was also I just thought it was the whole thing was refreshingly substantive. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1647.46s)]
*  This was, you know, you can say I don't like that policy or I do like that policy, but it really was about like here the earth we live in the kinds of decisions you're going to make. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1652.46s)]
*  And it wasn't pie in the sky stuff. So very, very well done job. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1663.46s)]
*  Let me just start by saying that. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1666.46s)]
*  OK, well, I'm just going to see her sit here and soak in those compliments. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1668.46s)]
*  So we don't have to talk about anything else. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1672.46s)]
*  I think what you're actually complimenting is that it was a normal interview, Chris. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1674.46s)]
*  That's actually what it was. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1679.46s)]
*  It was a normal interview. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1681.46s)]
*  It was a person running to be the president of the United States. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1682.46s)]
*  And for 25 minutes, we talked about their vision and we talked about policy. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1686.46s)]
*  And I think you just said it right there. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1691.46s)]
*  At the end of the day, it's a OK if you don't like her policies. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1693.46s)]
*  Right. She made it very clear. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1697.46s)]
*  If you make over 400 grand a year next year, when the when the when the individual tax cuts expire, she's going to raise your taxes. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1698.46s)]
*  So if you are someone who just votes on that, well, then you know what you're doing. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1705.46s)]
*  You don't want to vote for her. And I think that it's just that we're so those tax. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1708.46s)]
*  Yo, this is a lie, dude. She's just lying to the American public. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1714.46s)]
*  The highest tax bracket in this country are not going to actually see a tax hike. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1718.46s)]
*  The only tax hike that will happen when the tax cuts expire are for everything but the top margin. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1724.46s)]
*  OK, the corporate tax rate is permanent. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1732.46s)]
*  The corporate tax rate cut was permanent. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1735.46s)]
*  And so was the tax cut for the top margin. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1738.46s)]
*  OK, everything beyond that, the under 400, their taxes are actually slated to increase. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1742.46s)]
*  This is not necessarily a bad thing. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1748.46s)]
*  She wants to raise wealthy taxes, though. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1751.46s)]
*  No, she's not going to do that. OK. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1753.46s)]
*  One, I have yet to hear an actual proposal on how that is going to happen beyond beyond some of the aspects of how things are taxed. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1755.46s)]
*  But also, I don't think you're going to pay your fair share of taxes. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1764.46s)]
*  That's such a funny argument to make because I'm in the highest income bracket, dumbass. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1770.46s)]
*  And also, in terms of my like real taxes that I pay, my effective tax rate due to the way that my revenue stream is structured is literally higher than anyone else in my tax bracket because I live in California and I'm pure income. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1776.46s)]
*  But having said that, however, given that I'm in the highest tax bracket, no, it's not going to actually increase. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1792.46s)]
*  OK, and I don't have an issue with increasing that. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1799.46s)]
*  Actually, if you understand the words that I'm saying, the words that are coming out of my mouth, I'm mad because she's not going to be able to do that. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1802.46s)]
*  Oh, my God. I'm over here being like, yo, they're not increasing. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1810.46s)]
*  They're not actually going to be able to successfully increase the tax, the taxable income of the highest earners in this country. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1816.46s)]
*  And there is no like valid plan in play for that. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1824.46s)]
*  And this guy's like, yeah, you're going to pay your fair share, brother. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1827.46s)]
*  It's weird situation where both major party candidates kind of got to say what they're going to do to bring prices down, even though what everyone's reacting to is an issue that is not that is a little bit in the past. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1831.46s)]
*  You see what I'm saying? Like, so she's got the price gouging thing, which I thought was a good answer. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1843.46s)]
*  But in some ways, it is really talking about the real thing. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1846.46s)]
*  It is a little bit in the past. And listen, everybody is lots of people are angry that grocery stores have made so much money and they shouldn't. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1850.46s)]
*  And I'm not defending grocery stores, but we should remember. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1857.46s)]
*  This is what's really annoying about this process, by the way, no matter what, like, given the tax bracket I'm in, Democrat or Republican, it doesn't matter. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1860.46s)]
*  OK, it doesn't change my circumstances. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1870.46s)]
*  OK, it does not change my circumstances at all. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1874.46s)]
*  I am technically arguing against my best interest when I argue for the Democrats to actually do progressive legislation, because I understand that [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1878.46s)]
*  that it is not about your short term financial relief or additional, you know, additional tax burdens being lifted. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1889.46s)]
*  OK, I think that there is a longer project that we must keep in mind in terms of building a normal society, a healthy society. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1897.46s)]
*  OK, it's stupid. It's dumb. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1907.46s)]
*  It's dumb. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1910.46s)]
*  An issue that has the American people angry and the American people aren't addressing aren't aren't thinking about what you just mentioned, which is [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1911.46s)]
*  I gotta say all in all, that was an excellent interview. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1920.46s)]
*  Hassan just wishes it was him interviewing her. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1922.46s)]
*  No, I don't. I don't wish to interview Kamala Harris at all. Tim Walz, maybe. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1924.46s)]
*  But definitely I don't give a shit about interviewing Kamala Harris at all. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1929.46s)]
*  It's just never going to happen. I'm far too adversarial for Kamala Harris's team to ever allow that to happen. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1934.46s)]
*  Does it not just keep scaling up? I would have thought there's more brackets for like CEO type roles above you. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1940.46s)]
*  What? Wealth in this country for CEO types in terms of real income come from stock options. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1946.46s)]
*  And no, I am in the I am in the top tax bracket. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1954.46s)]
*  I love you, Hassan, but you're sometimes annoyingly adversarial. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1957.46s)]
*  What? Yeah, sorry. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1961.46s)]
*  The Meg's Blanco 555. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1962.46s)]
*  I'm annoyingly adversarial because I don't think that this administration is communicating enough of a progressive message, nor are they genuinely interested in [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1965.46s)]
*  communicating a progressive message at all. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1974.46s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1976.46s)]
*  There's sometimes a moron and it pisses us off. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1977.46s)]
*  What? What the fuck is going on with chat right now? [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1981.46s)]
*  What is happening? [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1983.46s)]
*  Did you consider anything like the chatter? [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1985.46s)]
*  Not you. Oh, oh my God. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1987.46s)]
*  I love you, Assam, but sometimes the political takes that make up 90 percent of your content. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1990.46s)]
*  I hate. But other than that heart, there's just so much going on with the the awful instincts of the Kamala Harris campaign, which still is not going to. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=1993.46s)]
*  I just want to repeat this for all the liberals. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2004.46s)]
*  Okay. More on a recent Harris campaign. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2006.46s)]
*  By the way, this was Mark Cuban's insane narrative here. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2009.46s)]
*  Why Mark Cuban believes Trump and Sanders have overlap in economic plans? [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2016.46s)]
*  You are a brain dead moron operating as a campaign surrogate. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2020.46s)]
*  You dumb, you dumbass, you absolute baboon. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2025.46s)]
*  What the fuck is wrong with you? [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2029.46s)]
*  This, this, this paired up with Bernie Sanders coming out with an email being like Kamala Harris is nowhere near as progressive as I am. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2031.46s)]
*  Make no mistake. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2040.46s)]
*  It's so stupid. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2041.46s)]
*  And call you compared policy proposals made by Trump to those from independent Senator Bernie Sanders, who's a socialist. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2043.46s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2051.46s)]
*  Oh, it was a race for socialism, right? [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2052.46s)]
*  Bernie said that credit card companies should cap their rates, their interest rates at 15 percent. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2054.46s)]
*  Donald Trump, being the socialist that he is, had to beat Bernie. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2060.46s)]
*  So Donald Trump went out and recommended that interest rate caps be set to 10 percent. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2063.46s)]
*  I mean, the fact that he's even suggesting price controls and price caps is socialism 101. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2070.46s)]
*  I don't know if you know this, but your campaign that you're a surrogate for is also doing that. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2077.46s)]
*  Like, are you are you that dumb? [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2084.46s)]
*  Are you stupid? [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2086.46s)]
*  You must be right. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2087.46s)]
*  Kamala Harris literally has a policy out there in the books that is simply doing that for grocery prices. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2089.46s)]
*  OK, they don't call it that because obviously Americans are too stupid and too scared of such a reality. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2097.46s)]
*  They're calling it, you know, going after price gouging. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2103.46s)]
*  But if you're going to on price caps like this, acting as a surrogate for the Kamala Harris campaign while simultaneously [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2107.46s)]
*  besmirching socialism and calling Trump a socialist, like what is going on, man? [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2115.46s)]
*  Nobody thinks that the Republicans are behaving like socialists. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2122.46s)]
*  OK, if you think socialism is bad, then you automatically are like, well, the Democrats are doing a little bit of socialism or a lot of [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2125.46s)]
*  socialism, depending on how brainbroken you are. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2132.46s)]
*  But ultimately, you're just reiterating the position that socialism is bad and therefore Democrats bad. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2134.46s)]
*  Oh, I think Cuban is pointing out the hypocrisy from the right. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2139.46s)]
*  He's not on the policy. He is shitting on the policy. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2142.46s)]
*  He just said price, price caps are socialism. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2144.46s)]
*  You haven't heard that from the vice president. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2148.46s)]
*  You have heard that from Donald Trump. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2151.46s)]
*  Well, how do you interpret how do you say how do you interpret what she's doing in terms of price gouging, taking on price gouging by by food companies? [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2153.46s)]
*  Oh, Jake Tapper immediately. OK, there you go. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2162.46s)]
*  What do you mean? You just said you hate price caps while you're literally talking about acting as a Kamala Harris surrogate there. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2167.46s)]
*  It's such a dumbass position to launch as a Kamala Harris surrogate that even Jake Tapper was like, what are you talking about? [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2176.46s)]
*  Because a lot of critics have said that that is a form of price controls. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2183.46s)]
*  I'm glad you asked me that, Jake, because price taking on price gouging is not price controls. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2187.46s)]
*  She's not saying what the price of tomatoes should be. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2192.46s)]
*  What she's saying is when there's a crisis and there will be other crisis, there'll be hurricanes, there'll be tornadoes, there'll be floods, there'll be other disasters. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2195.46s)]
*  And when those disasters happen, it's already illegal. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2203.46s)]
*  The follow up then is, well, OK, that's already illegal. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2206.46s)]
*  So I guess it's not a new policy. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2209.46s)]
*  She's not going to do anything then. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2211.46s)]
*  She wants to be in a position to be able to say, no, you can't jack up those prices by 40 percent. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2213.46s)]
*  Oh, oh, wait. Are you saying that she's going to institute? [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2219.46s)]
*  I don't know. Some kind of cap. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2222.46s)]
*  She said you can't jack up those prices. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2225.46s)]
*  Oh, as in she's going to control prices, you know, put a cap on the prices. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2229.46s)]
*  What an idiot this guy is. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2237.46s)]
*  The Harris campaign needs to get Cuban out campaigning for her. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2239.46s)]
*  How many republicans will take the one? [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2242.46s)]
*  You have to stay within a particular realm, a particular guideline. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2244.46s)]
*  And Mark Cuban is such a capitalist. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2248.46s)]
*  And why is he defending this position where he thinks demand doesn't deserve the control? [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2250.46s)]
*  The man doesn't deserve to control the price. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2253.46s)]
*  Not saying I agree, but this argument is so stupid. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2255.46s)]
*  I mean, because nobody nobody is it depends on what his ambitions are. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2258.46s)]
*  If it's an industry that he is like invested in, then I'm sure he wants to make that argument. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2263.46s)]
*  But if it's something else, then, you know, he's going to be like, you can have some some controls. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2268.46s)]
*  And by the way, there are already 37 states that have similar guidelines. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2274.46s)]
*  All she's doing is saying we're just going to make that a national law. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2279.46s)]
*  So that's certainly not price caps or price controls at all. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2282.46s)]
*  Donald Trump, on the other hand, is the king of price caps. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2286.46s)]
*  Why are you saying this about Donald Trump when price caps in terms of going against price gouging is Kamala Harris's most popular policy? [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2289.46s)]
*  Hey, have you guys let me tell you about Kamala Harris's most popular policy. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2300.46s)]
*  First of all, it's very different than it's very different. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2306.46s)]
*  It's not like Bernie Sanders at all. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2312.46s)]
*  Bernie Sanders, one of the most popular, historically popular congresspersons of all time. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2314.46s)]
*  Trump is exactly like that guy. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2321.46s)]
*  Also, on top of that, Kamala Harris's most popular policy. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2323.46s)]
*  Yeah, Trump is doing that. Trump wants to do that. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2327.46s)]
*  What is happening, man? I just don't even fully understand what's happening here. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2330.46s)]
*  Let's go policy, both as rhetoric, right? [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2333.46s)]
*  We need redundancy and supply chain. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2336.46s)]
*  Something she talked about with steel. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2339.46s)]
*  We need to bring manufacturing back and we're going to use policy levers to it. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2341.46s)]
*  That there is continuity there, right? [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2344.46s)]
*  Like that part of the Biden agenda, which is a huge part of it, is also part of the hair. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2346.46s)]
*  If the Republicans keep giving corporate tax cuts, why do they keep endorsing Democrats? [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2350.46s)]
*  You mean corporations? [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2354.46s)]
*  First of all, more corporations still endorse the Republican Party than the Democratic Party. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2356.46s)]
*  It's sector by sector. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2359.46s)]
*  That's number one. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2361.46s)]
*  Number two, wealthy people endorse the Democratic Party because the Democratic Party has the exact same interest in mind [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2362.46s)]
*  that the Republican Party has in terms of where to move the economy. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2369.46s)]
*  Make no mistake, they might say something when they're running for office, [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2373.46s)]
*  but what they do when they actually end up winning office is very different. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2377.46s)]
*  So they already know that. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2381.46s)]
*  So they have that confidence already when they endorse the Democratic Party, [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2382.46s)]
*  partially because Donald Trump is too chaotic and too much chaos might not necessarily contribute to a growth economy. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2387.46s)]
*  So that volatility alone is one reason why a lot of corporations who want some level of stability will choose to defend [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2394.46s)]
*  the Democratic Party over the Republican Party. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2402.46s)]
*  It's bad. Too much volatility is bad for business. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2407.46s)]
*  So that's the major reason why they go with the Democratic Party when they do. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2409.46s)]
*  But even then, there's plenty of industries that still are firmly in the tank for the Republican Party. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2413.46s)]
*  If all institutions also lose legitimacy, then the American project falls apart. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2418.46s)]
*  If the American project falls apart, then we're like, you know, going towards a capitalist dystopian future [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2423.46s)]
*  where you can't eke out the same level of profits that you normally would be able to get under stability and institutional legitimacy. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2429.46s)]
*  What is this? [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2438.46s)]
*  Is it morally wrong for George W. Bush to stay on the 2024 sidelines? [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2440.46s)]
*  Analysts discuss. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2444.46s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2445.46s)]
*  All right. Let's see what Trump says. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2447.46s)]
*  To prevent Donald Trump from returning to the White House because they know I will make America great again. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2448.46s)]
*  They don't want that. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2454.46s)]
*  Four years ago, our country was feared and respected and our country will soon be feared and respected again. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2455.46s)]
*  We have to have that. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2463.46s)]
*  And that's why we all need to pull together to thwart these attempts and to bring back American strength, power and prestige. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2464.46s)]
*  We will soon have it back. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2473.46s)]
*  No threat will shake me. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2475.46s)]
*  No enemy will intimidate me. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2477.46s)]
*  And I have I have never been more determined than I am today. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2479.46s)]
*  And I will never back down in my fight to make America great again, which is what we're doing. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2483.46s)]
*  So I want to make that statement because we are under threat. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2490.46s)]
*  I have been threatened very directly and I appreciate the agencies that we've been meeting with. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2493.46s)]
*  But we've been threatened very directly by Iran. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2499.46s)]
*  And I think you have to let them know because the best way to do it is through the office of the president that you do any attacks on former presidents or candidates for president. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2502.46s)]
*  Your country gets blown to smithereens, as we say. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2513.46s)]
*  Forty one days from now, we are going to win the state of North Carolina. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2517.46s)]
*  We are going to defeat comrade Kamala Harris and we are going to take back our country. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2522.46s)]
*  We're going to take it back. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkoQck1uIA&t=2530.46s)]
