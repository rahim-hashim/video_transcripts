# Interview With Greg Casar About The Crisis Within The Democratic Party
**HasanAbi:** [April 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8)
*  need a stronger contrast with Republicans be willing enough to engage in controversy [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=0.0s)]
*  so that people notice what the comes out of her mouth and I and people noticed on USAID because [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Trump got rid of it and we're saying hey this might like lots of kids that don't need and [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  there's controversy so people know the difference between the two parties. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=19.44s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen hopefully we have Greg Kazar in the building let's see if we actually [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=22.48s)]
*  do he hasn't okay oh no hello you want to you want to put your camera sideways you want [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=34.56s)]
*  to put your phone sideways oh almost okay no it's still vertical you want to you want [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=42.24s)]
*  to turn it sideways yeah there it is perfect all right we got congressperson Greg's are [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=47.4s)]
*  the building ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for coming on this is very interesting [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=54.0s)]
*  times to have you on I have a lot of questions for you it feels like every day and bad day [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=58.72s)]
*  but yeah looking forward to talking yeah last time you were here I was hoping that you would [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=69.16s)]
*  become the next leader of the progressive caucus and since then it has happened and [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=75.32000000000001s)]
*  it's a very exciting times I guess because there is some momentum building up right now [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=79.84s)]
*  within the Democratic Party there's a couple different planks I would say in the Democratic [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=86.2s)]
*  Party it seems like you got the abundance mindset people on the one hand but then you have the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=93.92s)]
*  populace left on the other with Bernie Sanders AOC yourself included in this in the big tent [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=98.76s)]
*  not to say that these guys are fighting against one another but instead it seems like there is a [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=105.04s)]
*  little bit of a little bit of a party restructuring that's taking place and I do hope and this is my [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=109.04s)]
*  assessment you don't have to agree with this or not I do hope that the populace left will win out [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=119.08s)]
*  in this process for because I feel like it's the last hope for America to not completely collapse [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=125.48s)]
*  on its own contradictions well I'm really happy to talk about that so let's do it all right what [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=134.44s)]
*  do you think about that then what do I think about that baseline proposition well I think you are [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=141.48s)]
*  right about a few I think to me very clearly right about a few parts of this one you know [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=146.92s)]
*  the Democratic Party lost in November was devastating for the world and Trump being elected [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=152.44s)]
*  obviously has led to daily horrible abuses but right when that happened there was [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=159.88s)]
*  immediately a big debate about whether this was a big deal of a loss or not and you know I went [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=167.0s)]
*  it back to Washington DC from Texas and there were folks who were saying hey this wasn't so bad the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=173.16s)]
*  Dems didn't lose by very much and there were those of us who said no this is devastating losing [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=178.35999999999999s)]
*  working-class voters in this way over the course of the last decade plus destroyed the entire [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=184.76s)]
*  purpose of the party undermines the entire philosophy of the party we might as well pack [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=190.51999999999998s)]
*  up and just go home and go the way of the Whig party if we can't solve that and at first there [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=195.39999999999998s)]
*  was that debate whether this was a big deal and that argument in some ways has been won by those [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=200.6s)]
*  folks of all wings of the party who thought this was really bad because now there's actually people [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=207.48s)]
*  who agree no matter where they stand on centrists versus left or populist versus technocratic they [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=212.68s)]
*  say yeah we've been losing working-class voters and we got to fix that so people have acknowledged [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=219.32s)]
*  the collapse the only hope in that is it seems like everybody's willing to go and work on the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=224.76000000000002s)]
*  problem and then what you've pointed out is now different people are coming up with their different [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=230.36s)]
*  ways of saying well what should the politics of the party be and I think just the other day after [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=235.88s)]
*  this Wisconsin's supreme court election that democrats so overwhelmingly won by rightfully [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=242.68s)]
*  targeting musk's pillaging not just of our economy but of our government I think the anti-oligarchy [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=248.04000000000002s)]
*  political argument has really started winning the day there too because it wasn't very long ago [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=255.56s)]
*  and I'd be interested you know folks watching at home you should google it there were a lot of [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=260.28000000000003s)]
*  articles written in November December January about certain democrats worrying whether punching [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=264.12s)]
*  musk was good politics or not they were saying oh this might backfire on us to we should be [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=270.28s)]
*  talking about how somebody making a jillion of dollars is a good thing that's aspirational [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=275.64s)]
*  now most people don't think a billionaire should be buying the government and running the economy [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=279.71999999999997s)]
*  and I think we're starting to win that argument too but happy to keep talking about that but my [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=284.2s)]
*  assessment is that was a real debate it's not done but actually the forces of people who say we can [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=288.11999999999995s)]
*  build a big tent by being a populist working people's party I haven't seen this much success [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=295.16s)]
*  in a while of course it's under really dire circumstances yeah I think also a part of that [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=303.08000000000004s)]
*  movement also needs to to come with like real tangible changes being made in ways that the [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=312.20000000000005s)]
*  american population can see and comprehend and I think that starts off with not instantly running [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=321.56s)]
*  to Silicon Valley tech CEOs and the remainder that still support the democratic party and saying no [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=327.88s)]
*  no we're going to give you unfettered access as well once we come back to power please don't [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=333.32s)]
*  remove your donations please don't remove us from the donation list but instead to say no this [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=338.2s)]
*  country is not run by oligarchs this country is not run by the incredibly wealthy and maybe [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=344.92s)]
*  repackaging it not even with the terms oligarchs but by simple corruption because Trump did [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=350.6s)]
*  something that I consider to be expert level messaging where he just said he's going to drain [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=357.48s)]
*  the swamp that was a lie he is a swamp monster himself but it was at its face something that [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=362.12s)]
*  we see in latin american countries quite a bit as a matter of fact anti-corruption messaging [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=369.32000000000005s)]
*  and I think that the democrats could also engage in anti-corruption messaging but it's not just [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=374.28s)]
*  about saying that you're anti-corruption you also show that you're anti-corruption because [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=380.76s)]
*  the republican party's retort always is well you have billionaires on your side too and it's all [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=385.23999999999995s)]
*  the woke ones and they're gay and bad or whatever right so I think that there is definitely [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=390.28s)]
*  there's definitely some some more movement that needs to happen in the democratic party on that [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=397.4s)]
*  front but I do feel we are being open to do it now I mean part of what I hope we can do is right [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=402.2s)]
*  now when there's all this energy against corruption let's go and and ask folks to get on the bills to [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=408.68s)]
*  ban congressional stock trading to permanently get big money out of politics to end gerrymandering [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=414.84s)]
*  and I think there's more energy towards that than any other time that I've been paying attention [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=421.32s)]
*  here to congressional politics the energy has been there of course for years but I feel like [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=426.59999999999997s)]
*  there's an opening for us to do it right now I was at this rally in Tucson with Bernie and AOC [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=431.48s)]
*  we were told there were going to be about 2 000 people in a high school gym 23 000 people showed [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=439.08000000000004s)]
*  up they took over the entire football field it was the biggest rally in Arizona history and there were [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=444.44s)]
*  a lot of folks there who said look I wasn't with Bernie 10 years ago but damn he's been wrecked [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=449.48s)]
*  this entire time before when he was talking about billionaires running the show behind the curtain I [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=454.68s)]
*  wasn't so sure but now they're out here in public bragging about it and running cabinet meetings and [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=459.16s)]
*  so there's a real opening I think where the voters are going to go towards the people who say [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=465.32000000000005s)]
*  that breaking the unholy alliance between corporate greed and corrupt government should be [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=470.76000000000005s)]
*  like the central project of whatever the good party is and I hope that the democratic party [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=475.0s)]
*  go transforms and goes and fills that void yeah in the interim however in the short term I think [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=480.84000000000003s)]
*  in order to to offer America a stay of execution the democrats have a lot more that they must do [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=487.8s)]
*  in order to claw back confidence from the American public and I think a part of that is also engaging [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=494.35999999999996s)]
*  in obstructionist policies I will admit that one of the most united messages that I hear from the [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=500.12s)]
*  democratic caucus overall is specifically on issues that are not exactly not exactly top of [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=508.12s)]
*  mind for many Americans issues that they don't really care about whether it be restoring us aid [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=517.48s)]
*  funding now we can argue about whether or not us aid is a necessary force but that's not what I'm [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=523.08s)]
*  talking about to me I think Americans see us aid in the same way that they see NATO something that [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=528.84s)]
*  Biden is talking about its foreign policy it's not related directly to their to their pockets [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=534.84s)]
*  even if even if it does have a lot of good right I think on the messaging front it seems like [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=540.44s)]
*  the caucus the democratic party uniting on those issues rather than issues that directly pertain [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=547.08s)]
*  to their civil liberties being taken away I feel like is a is a moment that they are [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=552.44s)]
*  that they're missing out on doing messaging on not focusing on austerity and how damaging [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=560.04s)]
*  austerity is and mass layouts at the federal level as much I think is also another one [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=565.64s)]
*  and you can do that around the the anti-elon sentiment as well because he is seen as the [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=572.28s)]
*  figurehead for this initiative well and here's an interesting point where I think you know I'm [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=577.0s)]
*  I'm even though I'm weird and I'm in Congress and we're all just sort of humans and we pick up [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=585.48s)]
*  messages in a certain kind of way and I think that what you just described even though you watch [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=591.48s)]
*  Congress and politics really close it's really interesting because technically the united message [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=597.0s)]
*  that we hear all the time that I hear every day in the halls of Congress is defend social security [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=603.08s)]
*  medicare and medicaid but even you what you hear most loudly is something like USAID why [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=607.72s)]
*  you ask yourself why and the answer it to me it tell me if you where if you disagree but I think [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=614.6s)]
*  it's because there's such a strong clear contrast between the republican position and the democratic [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=620.12s)]
*  position that it stands out in your mind doesn't matter if they said social security 10 times if [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=625.16s)]
*  the democrat said social security 10 times and USAID once you hear the USAID one louder because [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=631.0799999999999s)]
*  there's such a clear difference between the two parties and I think this is what where sometimes [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=636.52s)]
*  the democratic party not just sometimes I think a lot of times why the democratic party message [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=642.44s)]
*  falls flat because we think let's just say defend social security it polls like the name has pulled [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=647.5600000000001s)]
*  at 90 but nobody hears it why because it's boring republicans also say defend social security if we [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=653.5600000000001s)]
*  talked about expanding it making it so that no senior has to live in poverty ever again increasing [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=660.6s)]
*  the payments way past cost of living by making it so that people that make over $400,000 a year [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=666.12s)]
*  have to actually pay in the social security past $400,000 and there was some controversy around it [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=671.48s)]
*  then it'd be a message but right now what I'll tell you is if you say what you just said to [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=677.4s)]
*  the leaders in the party of which I'm sort of becoming one I guess in its own way as the [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=682.9200000000001s)]
*  progressive caucus chair they'd say that's not no no no our message is on social security and you'd [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=687.5600000000001s)]
*  be like well I don't know and we'd show you 10,000 press releases that fell in the forest but nobody [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=692.44s)]
*  heard a stronger contrast with republicans be willing enough to engage in controversy [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=699.56s)]
*  so that people notice what the hell comes out of her mouth and I and people noticed on USAID [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=706.4399999999999s)]
*  because trump got rid of it and we're saying hey this might starve like lots of kids that don't [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=712.68s)]
*  need starving and there's controversy so people know the difference between the two parties we [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=718.04s)]
*  say defend social security they say defend social security of course we know they're trying to [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=722.3599999999999s)]
*  gut it but the message is so similar that it gets lost out in the whole mess yeah no absolutely [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=727.24s)]
*  uh I think that's that's exactly what I want out of uh democratic leadership in general which is to [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=735.16s)]
*  uh to to move the reactionary forces within the republican party in the direction where they [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=742.04s)]
*  dominate the conversation and not play catch up against whatever the domineering republican [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=748.12s)]
*  narrative is and I think um while clearly uh uh Cory Booker doing the record-breaking filibuster [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=753.88s)]
*  even though it was not directional against like any sort of bill that was passing uh is a good [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=764.6s)]
*  start on this process I think even in that process uh even within that uh initiative uh in an effort [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=770.04s)]
*  to dominate the conversation because that's what his comms team said um if your message still [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=778.2800000000001s)]
*  falls flat to a certain degree because it doesn't have like a bold progressive agenda associated [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=784.12s)]
*  with it attached to it of like what the democrats stand for um the republican party will you know [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=789.24s)]
*  move on from that and and it'll be all but an afterthought now going back to this uh going back [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=797.1600000000001s)]
*  to what you just said though as far as like drawing a line of demarcation between your [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=803.72s)]
*  ideological enemies and the ideological enemies of the american working class I think there are [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=810.6800000000001s)]
*  plenty of standout issues where the democratic party could actually separate itself uh directly [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=817.5600000000001s)]
*  through through messaging discipline one of those instances is uh is is on immigration this is an [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=825.4s)]
*  issue that you and I align on almost entirely and yet I have seen very little conversations coming [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=832.92s)]
*  from the uh the top democratic leadership in congress uh and and I think that there needs to [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=839.7199999999999s)]
*  be significantly more organizing on this and the democrats should stop being fearful of all the [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=846.8399999999999s)]
*  polls that they see that show 60 percent of americans love you know random uh random venezuelan [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=852.76s)]
*  barbers being shipped off to El Salvador like they should stop focusing on that and instead have [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=860.28s)]
*  a a message that is dictated by empathy and morality and and start leading rather than [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=866.6s)]
*  following the republican example well here's a place where I think we have a lot to learn [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=872.52s)]
*  from just seven years ago remember immigration during the last trump administration was an [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=879.0799999999999s)]
*  offense issue for the democrats not a defense one because of course if you tell american voters [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=886.6s)]
*  an anxious moment where we aren't picking wall street ceos as the villains hey things are screwed [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=895.4s)]
*  up and if somebody is breaking the law you have a problem with them especially as folks report that [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=901.32s)]
*  they're feeling less safe in their own communities then yeah you're you're gonna wind up with some of [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=906.6800000000001s)]
*  the poll numbers you see but if you go and tell folks they're taking law enforcement resources [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=911.32s)]
*  they're supposed to keep you safe and like you said sending a barber to a foreign torture camp [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=916.84s)]
*  I mean that's not something that folks support and I think that if we can lead with empathy [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=922.5200000000001s)]
*  but where I would learn from last from last time around with the first trump administration [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=927.88s)]
*  is also tell people how this doesn't actually make you more safe then I think we can make this an [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=932.2800000000001s)]
*  offense issue too but we shouldn't lose that second part because due process isn't just an [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=936.76s)]
*  idealistic thing it's to protect your safety and your family's safety as soon as somebody [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=941.16s)]
*  can get bagged by a completely like a cop in a hoodie who is legally like a student who is [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=947.24s)]
*  legally present here can get bagged by a cop in a hoodie for their political opinions I mean that's [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=955.16s)]
*  just like not a country that people want to live in it's not the country that they imagine the [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=959.64s)]
*  United States to be and we've got to figure out how to get back on offense on immigration [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=963.32s)]
*  because you know immigration is going to keep happening in this country and we can't let [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=968.36s)]
*  the right wing forever have that as an issue and it's not and it's not just offense on immigration [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=972.6s)]
*  as well because this ties back to a severe perhaps the most significant violation of [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=978.6800000000001s)]
*  first amendment protections on US soil up until this very moment only in like historic moments [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=985.32s)]
*  of like war or during the the McCarthyist trial period during the most heated moments [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=992.28s)]
*  of the Red Scare did we have this level of erosion over the first amendment and it's [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=999.56s)]
*  happening at the behest of a foreign nation which I think is something that the Democrats could [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1005.24s)]
*  stress but I don't think that they will and it kind of goes back to the same fissure or the same [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1010.4399999999999s)]
*  lack of interest in in both leading by example and the lack of interest in listening to really [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1018.2s)]
*  loud majorities within the base when it comes to Israel I think this is you know people get very [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1027.0s)]
*  scared when the when the subject matter comes up like Democratic representatives, Democratic [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1034.92s)]
*  politicians get very scared to to make bold declarative statements about this issue with [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1041.4s)]
*  some notable exceptions but I think it's one that genuinely would would win a lot of favor from [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1047.0800000000002s)]
*  the the base of the Democratic Party and independence as well this is the one area [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1055.56s)]
*  where they never look at polls they look at polls when it comes to immigration but for some reason [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1059.72s)]
*  Democrats never look at the polls on this key issue where the overwhelming majority of the [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1063.8s)]
*  population wants to ceasefire and now they could be they could be polarizing the base [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1069.4s)]
*  and galvanizing the base against Donald Trump who has who has continued and accelerated the [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1075.32s)]
*  the violence that Palestinians are subjected to with our tax paying dollars and is using Israel [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1082.4399999999998s)]
*  and even worse than that using Judaism falsely with this conflation to blackbag people for the [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1088.9199999999998s)]
*  crime of of exercising their their free speech it's completely un-American it's completely [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1096.28s)]
*  unacceptable it I mean I'm continue to be disappointed with the small number of votes [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1102.12s)]
*  that we can get to stop sending bombs to Netanyahu who he just said the other day openly that he is [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1108.76s)]
*  keeping the Trump plan on the table of ethnic cleansing of Gaza so that just it's just [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1116.4399999999998s)]
*  un- it's just unacceptable to be unacceptable to anybody what Netanyahu continues to say he's [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1122.4399999999998s)]
*  pursuing over there and then on the free speech issue I think that we people that disagree with [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1129.4s)]
*  you or me on what is happening to folks in Palestine should still be speaking out on free [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1137.8000000000002s)]
*  speech in fact I think that it's really important for progressives when we see the free speech right [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1145.64s)]
*  scrambled of somebody with right-wing views to say no we somebody should also be able to express [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1152.8400000000001s)]
*  their right-wing views or their left-wing views or their popular views or their unpopular views and [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1159.24s)]
*  like you said this this is something that connects with our base of voters but honestly there's a lot [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1165.64s)]
*  of people that are independent and conservative where protection of free speech rights is deeply [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1170.3600000000001s)]
*  important to them too and again when I think about how we learn from the wave of organizing [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1175.3200000000002s)]
*  energy seven and eight years ago I'll be honest I was always pretty uncomfortable with how there [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1181.88s)]
*  were moments in that period of time where we where there were progressives that wanted to shut down [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1187.32s)]
*  like even right-wing speakers at a school look you can you can you can embarrass them you can [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1193.6399999999999s)]
*  point out that they're hypocrites but I think actually we should promote more and more speech [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1199.24s)]
*  because it never works out for dissidents and creative people and progressives and workers [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1205.08s)]
*  for the state to be able to stop speech it just never works out the right way and free speech I [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1211.3999999999999s)]
*  think is just sort of a a core to be a core value for any populist movement in my view [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1216.6s)]
*  just for viewers at home I think if you want to look up the really the right way of dealing with [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1222.12s)]
*  this a few decades ago in Austin where I'm sitting right now the KKK was setting up to do a march it [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1226.76s)]
*  was going to be a few dozen maniacs and activists went and asked the mayor to pull the permit and [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1233.7199999999998s)]
*  not let them march and the mayor I think did the right thing he let them have the permit you know [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1239.1599999999999s)]
*  the three dozen freaking wackos were marking marching up Congress Avenue in downtown and then [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1244.6s)]
*  200 Austinites showed up lined the street and as the KKK marched through they turned around pulled [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1249.7199999999998s)]
*  their pants down and moons them and humiliated them as they walked up the road and I feel like [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1257.1599999999999s)]
*  it's that kind of a spirit that's more of the American spirit that I think would actually [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1260.9199999999998s)]
*  like really behoove us as a democratic party to embrace yeah look uh the uh the debate over [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1266.28s)]
*  protecting the first amendment I think is better served uh when when had over the [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1273.4s)]
*  boundaries of like the actual erosions that are taking place your state uh some rigorous [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1277.96s)]
*  applications of boycott divestment and sanctions laws that are in direct violation of the first [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1283.0s)]
*  amendment they fired uh um uh I think she was like a speech therapist um here in eastern [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1287.88s)]
*  county because she refused to sign a statement saying that she was opposed to uh you know [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1295.64s)]
*  she was to get refused to participate in BDS so you don't have to you don't have to have a view [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1304.68s)]
*  on BDS to have a view that it's just deeply wrong yeah um for somebody to lose their job over that [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1310.76s)]
*  and so I think that's where this this gets most serious yeah and the two senators that uh were [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1317.4s)]
*  consistently critical of uh the anti-bds legislation were diane feinstein and bernie sanders um I think [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1322.04s)]
*  that this needs to be a conversation at least in my experience when I have this conversation with [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1329.56s)]
*  like right-wing people with reactionary people uh that I talk to both in you know in my day-to-day [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1335.1599999999999s)]
*  or even uh with commentators and whatnot they're they're shocked they're shocked that this is a [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1342.6s)]
*  thing that already exists in the united states of america far before october 7 and it is only [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1348.68s)]
*  accelerated uh under the the trump administration which unfortunately uh the biden administration [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1353.4s)]
*  also contributed to by consistently uh delegitimizing the very valid student protests [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1359.64s)]
*  and encampments that were taking place on college campuses with the 3100 arrests that took place [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1365.64s)]
*  specifically on college campuses uh for for uh students protesting against the the state of [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1373.0800000000002s)]
*  israel calling an apartheid or calling what israel is doing a genocide even beyond the first [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1379.64s)]
*  amendment grounds um I think that this is there's a reason why it only accelerates there's a reason [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1383.8s)]
*  why issues like this only uh turn uh worse and worse under the trump administration because [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1389.96s)]
*  democrats don't consistently stand on principles on this and I think that that is like [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1396.3600000000001s)]
*  a real area of of concern because I talked to esthete herndon from the new york times the other [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1401.4s)]
*  day and one of the things that he mentioned to me that is is uh kind of disappointing overall is that [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1408.3600000000001s)]
*  americans don't necessarily care about some of the most damaging aspects of the trump agenda [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1416.8400000000001s)]
*  and I think that that is due to a lack of communication from the the democratic party [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1422.68s)]
*  that is like re-centering the attention on these issues whether it be the first amendment erosions [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1429.24s)]
*  that are happening with the trump administration blackbagging uh student students with student [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1434.2s)]
*  visas and and even uh mahmoud khalil with a green card uh the process of denaturalization or the [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1439.0s)]
*  process of like revoking his green card is is on erroneous claims is is completely ridiculous [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1444.84s)]
*  and and also just the deportations as a whole uh and the erosion of due process as a whole is not [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1451.96s)]
*  something that the american population is aware of and I think beyond the tariffs beyond everything [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1458.12s)]
*  that we've just talked about the erosion of due process uh that that has a long-standing tradition [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1464.84s)]
*  since like the 12th uh the the 13th century in in uh and is at the underlying heart of liberalism [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1471.56s)]
*  in general um I think it's it's ridiculous that we are taking uh we're taking that away [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1479.6399999999999s)]
*  and it seems like the the public is not aware of it like that's that's terrifying I know it's really [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1486.2s)]
*  terrifying and I think that we should be more clearly calling it out and going on the offense [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1493.32s)]
*  on that issue when we're talking about immigration or when we're talking about public safety [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1499.56s)]
*  but I I also think that it's really important and we have this really critical moment where we [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1504.44s)]
*  recognize that if we aren't addressing the core economic needs and economic anxieties and of the [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1509.24s)]
*  people then we're just like all these other places that folks read about and think about only happens [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1516.36s)]
*  in a far away place you start losing those civil liberties if I mean at the end of the day we lost [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1522.1200000000001s)]
*  that november election because folks felt like prices going up and their wages being stagnant [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1529.72s)]
*  was a real freaking issue and we found it as democrats like the party of the status quo [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1536.36s)]
*  and that's at the end of the day and if you don't make sure that you're listening to how people are [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1541.24s)]
*  feeling and feel like you can actually address the issues of corruption in the economy baseline for [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1545.56s)]
*  people then next thing you know you open up that window where all these things you've had for [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1550.76s)]
*  hundreds of years can start to go away and I as somebody who deeply cares about the rights of the [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1555.32s)]
*  vulnerable about righteous causes that may not be fully popular yet we don't get to do any of that [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1561.64s)]
*  until we first make sure that we have a broad popular base of voters who believe that we care [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1568.68s)]
*  about absolutely and I think that's a big lesson for us I'm definitely 100 an agreement there for [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1574.44s)]
*  sure um I I do agree I think that um you are better equipped to protect marginalized identities [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1579.8000000000002s)]
*  marginalized communities like trans people if you already have a bold progressive populist agenda [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1586.92s)]
*  that that people sign on to and you can earnestly communicate that and and have people believe in [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1595.0800000000002s)]
*  your party again uh only after that can you go all right medicare for all means for all like we're [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1603.16s)]
*  not cutting trans people out of this bargain if you want uh health care then you know everyone [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1608.76s)]
*  else is going to get health care it doesn't matter yeah people would be like oh yeah they gave some [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1613.56s)]
*  health care to some people where I might have some disagreement but god my entire life got way better [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1617.8799999999999s)]
*  so like that's a side that's a side complaint you know that's like a fact they pulled my [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1623.0s)]
*  grandparents out of poverty and my neighbor's kids entirely out of poverty and yeah you know [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1627.96s)]
*  the asylum program seems maybe a little bit more liberal than I would want it but like at the end [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1633.48s)]
*  of day these are the good guys I mean that's where we want to be absolutely um I want to I want to [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1637.48s)]
*  ask you one final question that might be a little tricky and uh okay so that's uh that's why I come [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1642.76s)]
*  on here man I always have two questions two questions uh first and foremost I uh this is [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1649.08s)]
*  not the tricky one um first and foremost the the bernie aoc and you've participated in this as well [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1654.04s)]
*  the the stop oligarchy tour is is great I've attended it I plan on attending the Los Angeles [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1660.6s)]
*  rally in april's uh 12th as well and I think that it's good because it's motivating the democratic [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1666.04s)]
*  party to pay attention to this kind of messaging and it's like it's proving your work basically [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1671.32s)]
*  that this kind of uh this kind of populist messaging is is something that people want they [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1676.1200000000001s)]
*  want a fighter they want solutions I do however worry that it kind of falls short of what is [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1680.52s)]
*  necessary for the time right now and one of the things that I've one of the things that I'm [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1686.36s)]
*  advocating for at least is that um there should be a narrower focus on key issues that we want to [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1689.96s)]
*  either a help fight against or b uh move uh move messaging in the direction of and I think that [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1697.72s)]
*  that would require organizing uh beyond just organizing a rally but then using the organizational [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1704.92s)]
*  capabilities of this of this movement to direct it at individual problems uh mass demonstrations uh [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1711.16s)]
*  the the unjustifiable uh arrest of Mahmoud Khalil for example I think that that would be [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1718.92s)]
*  a really good way to solidify uh and and single out an issue where there is a serious [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1724.92s)]
*  erosion of the first amendment and and uh and be able to maybe even deliver some kind of tangible [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1734.2s)]
*  results there to to really prove that this uh this kind of uh popular momentum can get stuff done [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1741.0s)]
*  what do you think about that yeah I mean I I mean I think free Mahmoud Khalil is a great organizing [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1749.72s)]
*  principle and I hope to hear those words repeated over and over again until not only he is freed [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1755.72s)]
*  but everybody else in his situation is freed um the two messages that I have tried to really [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1760.76s)]
*  focus people on both at those rallies and through my own messaging are to save Medicaid as we know [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1766.92s)]
*  it because it is on the chopping block like they want to end it as we know it in the coming months [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1772.92s)]
*  that is a winnable fight an entirely winnable fight you just need national pressure and have [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1779.0s)]
*  three Republicans out of over 200 of them flip and we could win that just like the Affordable [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1783.72s)]
*  Care Act which obviously you and I both great have you know know how little it is compared to [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1789.16s)]
*  what we want but since that was saved about seven years ago that was a galvanizing moment now [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1794.12s)]
*  Medicaid is on chopping block and then second firing Elon Musk which I was told by Republican [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1799.16s)]
*  members of Congress was never going to happen uh that he was going to make it through just as long [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1804.84s)]
*  if not longer than Trump Trump's already starting to feel the pressure of how this is politically [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1808.68s)]
*  dragging him down I think it'd be a huge win if we get Elon Musk fired um and you know that those [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1813.88s)]
*  are the sorts of organizing principles where I think we got to make a clear demand in my view [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1820.6000000000001s)]
*  fire Elon Musk is a great central uh organizing principle saving Medicaid as you know it great [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1825.3200000000002s)]
*  central organizing principle of course freeing Mr. Khalil is a moral imperative people can have [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1831.0800000000002s)]
*  their whole long grocery list but I think honestly it's not that long and and we can [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1837.16s)]
*  uh have organizing campaigns around each of them but to me it all kind of brings us back to [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1841.96s)]
*  what is the Democratic Party's central organizing principle and I don't think it can be a laundry [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1849.16s)]
*  list of issues anymore and back in the 20s and 30s and 40s and 50s it was breaking that alliance [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1853.8000000000002s)]
*  between corporate greed and corrupt government and saying that that's that that at its heart [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1861.32s)]
*  is the is is the problem that we're trying to fix for people and I think we've got a a chance [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1867.0s)]
*  of bringing at least some of that back here in the coming months around any of those campaigns [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1873.32s)]
*  yeah um okay so the last question I have for you before we let you go and thank you so much for [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1877.96s)]
*  coming on is uh that there's a New York mayoral race where uh you uh endorsed a Bradlander you've [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1883.0s)]
*  met him before according to the political reports at least when you're a council member and so was [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1891.16s)]
*  he in New York and I was wondering what the decision making uh was there especially considering that [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1895.08s)]
*  there is currently a lot of popular momentum building behind someone who um I have supported [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1903.0s)]
*  someone who I plan on interviewing as well as Zoran Mamdani and Brad from what I understand is [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1909.0s)]
*  also a a progressive person as well it's not you know he's not exactly like a conservative either [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1914.36s)]
*  but I was wondering if there's a what was like you especially as the leader of the progressive caucus [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1921.16s)]
*  I'm happy to talk about it you know and I got the chance to talk with Senator Mamdani the other day [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1927.96s)]
*  and I wished him a ton of luck and hope people rank him uh really highly as well and obviously [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1933.0s)]
*  would be thrilled if he was uh if he was able to be to win the mayor's race uh I endorsed [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1939.4799999999998s)]
*  Bradlander who's the controller of the city of New York so he's a city-wide elected official already [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1945.6399999999999s)]
*  and I've worked with Brad for years and years and years like 10 years I was elected to the city [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1953.56s)]
*  council here in Austin first ran when I was 24 started out when I was 25 met Brad when he was a [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1960.6s)]
*  New York city council member and what's really special about Brad is he is like a generous [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1966.6799999999998s)]
*  person in politics most people are trying to figure out how relationships and things flow to [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1973.56s)]
*  themselves he was out there helping make sure that things were better in cities all around the [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1977.8s)]
*  country uh without taking credit for it and uh that's potentially maybe sometimes just political [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1982.84s)]
*  detriment but you know we were working for example he like on making sure that we could [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1989.0s)]
*  pass paid sick days policies in Texas Dallas Austin San Antonio just like the one that he [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1994.2s)]
*  helped get done in New York City when there were tenants getting evicted in the city of New York [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=1999.56s)]
*  and that uh the big money that was actually behind the equity fund private equity fund that [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2005.24s)]
*  was kicking them out was based in Texas we were coordinating across states so he's a great guy [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2010.44s)]
*  very very progressive and I think has a real shot of building a winning coalition because [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2016.12s)]
*  he's already a citywide elected official but the good news is with ranked choice voting [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2020.4399999999998s)]
*  uh he doesn't have to be a spoiler to uh Zoran and Zoran doesn't have to be a spoiler to Brad [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2025.48s)]
*  people that support them can rank them as number one and number two or number two and number one [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2031.0s)]
*  as a as a real shot as well according to all the polls that I've seen so far uh I think everyone [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2035.6399999999999s)]
*  at least every progressive person every leftist person even uh liberals should probably try and [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2043.3200000000002s)]
*  make sure that Andrew Cuomo is not uh the the next mayor of New York City yeah amen to that and I [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2051.32s)]
*  and I think it's a great reason for us again in this New York City mayoral race you've got things [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2060.92s)]
*  like public financing of campaigns uh you've got ranked choice voting and so that creates the [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2065.88s)]
*  opportunity for there to be coalition building uh where you know like you and me don't have to be [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2071.48s)]
*  talking about how your candidate's screwing up the other candidate's shot I think that they can um [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2076.92s)]
*  and and that's part of why I think you know reforming our electoral system is is so key uh [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2082.6s)]
*  not just in New York but across the country yeah all right well thank you so much uh and I look [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2088.6s)]
*  forward to hearing from you again uh Greg Kazar everybody is there any final words that you want [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2095.72s)]
*  to part uh impart on people here yeah well thanks for having me on and I just thank everybody [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2100.36s)]
*  watching you got to know like we're in a moment um you know I went and had a town hall in chip [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2106.28s)]
*  roy's district who leads helps lead the right wing freedom caucus and a town of 8500 people [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2112.52s)]
*  400 folks you know showed up so the organizing you're doing can make a real difference I know [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2117.32s)]
*  like the last few months people are like what could I do does this make a difference these [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2123.0s)]
*  phone calls these town halls these marches this organizing you can do at your workplace [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2126.84s)]
*  it makes it real if we're in a moment right now where we can transform and reshape the [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2131.32s)]
*  democratic party where we can change the boundaries of of all this but we got to [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2136.76s)]
*  think about speaking to a broad set of people oh okay I have another question I can't believe [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2141.7200000000003s)]
*  I didn't ask you about this you know you're getting a little space to yeah drag on and here we go [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2147.4s)]
*  yeah no Trump's tariffs uh so the UAW has come out here for world now yeah UAW has has come out [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2153.56s)]
*  in support of it I love I love Sean Fain I I understand where they're coming from in terms [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2160.8399999999997s)]
*  of like trade protectionist policies it does feel like this is another moment for the democrats [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2165.8799999999997s)]
*  where I I hope that they message in this moment in the in the appropriate way where they don't [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2171.3199999999997s)]
*  come out as like unrestricted free trade supporters which is precisely the reason why [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2178.6s)]
*  Donald Trump was able to carry over that resentment against the Clinton brand in 2016 [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2184.6s)]
*  where a lot of the working class have lost their jobs due to NAFTA truly despise this this brand [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2190.6s)]
*  of democratic party politics and while Trump is of course going in this direction in the most [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2199.4s)]
*  haphazard way possible there needs to be a industrial base built here before any sort [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2205.64s)]
*  of trade protectionism could take place and obviously these tariffs are going to increase [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2212.7599999999998s)]
*  the cost of living the cost of all goods and it's going to have truly harmful effects I I do hope [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2217.16s)]
*  that the democratic party position overall is not we have to protect free trade because I feel like [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2224.3599999999997s)]
*  that in and of itself is going to that in and of itself is not going to be a popular message what [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2230.52s)]
*  do you think about that before yeah that's what Trump wants Democrats to do he wants us to Democrats [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2235.96s)]
*  to just be the anti-Trump party so then just go back into as much Clintonism as possible which is [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2241.48s)]
*  gonna which sounds like we don't care about having American jobs here we can't do that yeah what we [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2247.64s)]
*  should say is you know tariffs are a powerful tool they're like a scalpel and what Trump is going and [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2253.4s)]
*  doing is the equivalent of using a chainsaw for brain surgery I mean like as you pointed out it's [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2259.0s)]
*  reckless he's gonna raise prices and he doesn't care about bringing American jobs home or about [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2263.48s)]
*  you know the American worker or good good benefits in good paying American jobs especially which is [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2270.2s)]
*  something that the UAW stressed when when considering of course the the fact that he is [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2275.96s)]
*  removing the collective bargaining power from one million plus federal employees right now [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2281.56s)]
*  yeah he just he basically just wiped out collective bargaining for a million and a half [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2286.76s)]
*  people and that should be the central rallying cry for our party and frankly I think he needs [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2291.32s)]
*  to be talking a lot more about that he just got rid of the minimum wage of $17 an hour for federal [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2297.6400000000003s)]

*  leaders of foreign nations going to Jared Kushner and Eric Frump and making an investment deal and [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2316.92s)]
*  suddenly oh yeah they're off I mean at the end of the day this is all about about you know [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2322.2000000000003s)]
*  grump and the corrupt folks making more money not about bringing American jobs home and that's where [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2327.7200000000003s)]
*  we got to go and here's here's here's I think the last bit of news of the week here alongside the [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2332.2000000000003s)]
*  tariffs for my party words are you know Democrats used to cozy up to folks like Mark Zuckerberg [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2337.8s)]
*  because they thought he was on their side but he was always a problem there's always screwing [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2344.52s)]
*  workers and consumers he couldn't be controlling the information that we all get and as soon as [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2348.2s)]
*  trumped in office right he goes and cuts the 25 million dollar zuckerberg settlement with [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2354.04s)]
*  trump 25 million dollars and passes from and now he's got multiple meetings at the oval office [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2359.7200000000003s)]
*  he's trying to get rid of his anti-monopoly lawsuit so this is the moment where Democrats need to say [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2364.76s)]
*  we're breaking with those guys those are the guys that are going to be cutting trump the check [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2370.6s)]
*  the tariffs tariffs can work but this is actually all part right now of the trump casting in grip [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2375.24s)]
*  it's a sales tax it's a sales tax and they want to cut the last like remaining progressive [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2381.3199999999997s)]
*  taxation structure we have in this country and they want to make the working poor foot the bill [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2389.88s)]
*  by implementing this cost are going to go up for these things trump promised voters whether [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2395.4s)]
*  they're voting for him or not that he's going to bring down costs and all these trumps have been [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2400.36s)]

*  the people people speaking out and responding to that message makes a big difference because if we [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2415.8s)]
*  can get folks to run for the house on that kind of message and win some of these tough seats [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2421.24s)]
*  then you'll have folks running for president on that kind of message and what trump did is he [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2425.7999999999997s)]
*  transformed the entire republican party from a mitt romney style party to the trump style party [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjpnNXEcK8&t=2430.4399999999996s)]
