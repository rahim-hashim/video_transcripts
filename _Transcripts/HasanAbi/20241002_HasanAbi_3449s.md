*  have you been in the States? No, it's like around two weeks. I came before for like also another [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=67.36s)]
*  two weeks. Okay. Cool. Cool. So for those of you who don't know, Motaz is a survivor. He is a [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=74.16s)]
*  photojournalist. He is one of the most important voices across the board in humanizing the plight [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=81.92s)]
*  of the Palestinians throughout this entire process. And you know, you're, you're a hero. I, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=89.28s)]
*  I have tremendous respect for you. I think what you've done is incredible. I'm going to, I'm going [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=96.08s)]
*  to hype you up a little bit. I know that probably makes you feel a little uncomfortable, but Motaz [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  one of the 100 most influential people of 2024 corner time magazine for 108 days, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=106.64s)]
*  Motaz acted as the world's eyes and ears in his native arm with a camera and a flag jacket, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=113.28s)]
*  Mark press, the 25 year old Palestinian photographer spent nearly four months [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=117.6s)]
*  documenting life under Israeli right off the jump. Before we get to your background, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=121.28s)]
*  before we get to how you started as a photojournalist, I do, I do want to talk about [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=126.8s)]
*  the role that I think you and Bizaan and many others played in, in changing the dynamic in [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=132.96s)]
*  the way that I think the Western world views Palestinians as because I'm Turkish, I'm Muslim. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=140.4s)]
*  I grew up with a very different understanding, of course, to that in comparison to Americans [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=148.96s)]
*  and in comparison to people in the Western world in, in analyzing Israel as, as not [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=155.12s)]
*  necessarily the most moral state, nor a democratic state, but instead a colonial vestige, a settler, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=162.48000000000002s)]
*  colonial apartheid state. And a lot of people, I think in the aftermath of, of Israel's incredibly [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=170.56s)]
*  incursion, which is a started recognizing that reality, but how do they recognize that reality? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  I think you guys played a big role in making people understand the reality by, by, you know, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=187.52s)]
*  putting on, I mean, by, by showcasing all of the things that were going on and by communicating [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  that you were human. And I think that was very effectively, Israel had done a very good job of, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=203.04000000000002s)]
*  of show, like refusing to showcase that side. So thank you. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me. Unfortunately, the world, the world had to understand what is [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=216.08s)]
*  happening in our sufferer on our plot. And we lost like more than 50,000 people and hundreds of [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=221.76000000000002s)]
*  thousands left. A hundred of thousands are injured and thousands also missed. So unfortunately, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=229.12s)]
*  sacrificed. Yeah, it discovered to the world the proto-occupation and what they are doing, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=239.84s)]
*  but they are also like souls and people who passed. Maybe [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=247.04s)]
*  doesn't worth it to lose all these people, all these souls, just to make a point for the world [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=255.04s)]
*  that we are humans. Because even me like coming to the country, going around, just to tell the world [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=260.0s)]
*  that you are humans, this is really desperate thing to do. But yeah, I had to do it. Yeah. No, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=266.88s)]
*  I, I totally, I totally understand where you're coming from. I'm sorry. I'm trying to also adjust [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=274.8s)]
*  your, your sound levels real quick and increase your microphone volume. So how do you, let's, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=278.88s)]
*  let's start off with, with your beginnings. You're, you're very young. You're 25 years old. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=290.48s)]
*  Yeah. I'm 33. I'm so old. Yeah. I'm an old man. Damn it. Okay. You're tall as hell. Do you ball? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=296.40000000000003s)]
*  No, you don't play basketball. I used to play, but you know, I'm like so used. I didn't find my [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=304.64000000000004s)]
*  shoe size in Gaza. Oh, really? Yeah. How big are your shoes? 15. You're a size 15. Yeah. So I'm 13. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=309.52000000000004s)]
*  I was going to give you, I was going to give you my shoes if you want to. You're paid for me, man. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=317.28000000000003s)]
*  Like, yeah, that's crazy. Okay. No, I know. I know a bunch of ballers. I, I talked to Omar [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=322.0s)]
*  Hertz show the, those guys a lot and, and Omar balls. And I mean, they're still in Gaza. So [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=330.56s)]
*  anyway, what I was going to say is how did you start? How did you choose to become a member of [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=338.8s)]
*  the press? Like what, how did your, like what's, what about your background says? Like you were [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=346.24s)]
*  like, I want to, I want to become a photojournalist. Yeah. I, it's not my first time, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=352.16s)]
*  you know, to do, to do this. And I used to cover wars and aggression in Gaza years before. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=358.08s)]
*  I used to be like a photographer who want to make a beautiful pictures, captured the sense of the [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=366.64s)]
*  people, the daily life, because there was a lot of destruction in Gaza, but I wanted to be different. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=372.64s)]
*  And it was hard, really hard to be different. And especially in an environment like Gaza, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=379.44s)]
*  where you can't even make a plan for two days because something will happen. Something will [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=385.68s)]
*  ruin all your plans. And like I tried my best to show the, the nice image from Gaza that the world [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=390.88s)]
*  doesn't know. But a lot of people, unfortunately, also like just know Gaza for wars, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=398.8s)]
*  people losing their lives, not for like the beautiful life there. And it wasn't also, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=404.24s)]
*  to be honest, wasn't easy life or really beautiful, but we're trying always to make it [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=409.84000000000003s)]
*  looks beautiful because our resistance is in our existence. So yeah. And like I covered massacres [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=416.24s)]
*  in 2017, I got a shot in my left leg in 2018. I was a volunteer, a paramedic with the BRCS. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=426.56s)]
*  2019, some aggressions, I was like covering it. 2021 for 11 days, I was like a really big escalation [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=435.92s)]
*  after Sheikh Jarrah, what was happening in Jerusalem. And then in 2023 of May, there was also [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=446.24s)]
*  five days of aggression. So I was like also documenting this. And yeah, this. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=454.32s)]
*  What is one aspect of living under the Israeli occupation that people don't necessarily know [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=463.28s)]
*  about or talk about that you think is unique? Yeah, that everything you want to do is a struggle. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=470.48s)]
*  Me as a photojournalist, I want to buy like a camera lens, I need to wait for three, four months, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=476.64s)]
*  then I need to pay like terrible taxes for Israel. And this is just for me as like a photojournalist [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=481.36s)]
*  and imagine the other stories of the people. If you want to start a business, if we want to [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=489.52000000000004s)]
*  travel, everything is will suffer. You can't, me from Gaza, I can't go to the West Bank or Jerusalem. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=493.92s)]
*  The people from West Bank can't come to Gaza. Also, they can't go to Jerusalem. So we don't [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=499.44s)]
*  have the freedom of movement in our lands. And if you want to go there, you need the permission from [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=506.0s)]
*  Israeli occupation. And you need like, you need to be like very sick, you're going to die. So maybe [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=511.76s)]
*  they can give you the permission. Sometimes they give you sometimes not everything, it's under [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=518.24s)]
*  their control. And yeah, so you don't have your freedom in your land even. Yeah, what part of [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=524.8s)]
*  Palestine is your family from originally? First of all, originally Gazan. Oh, okay. You're [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=534.08s)]
*  you're O.G. Gazan. Yeah. Okay. That's interesting. So I mean, everything, everything you've talked [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=538.5600000000001s)]
*  about everything you've spoken to is very heartbreaking. It's not necessarily once again, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=546.16s)]
*  it's not necessarily something that a lot of people were privy to, a lot of people were aware of, I think. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=552.48s)]
*  And in your analysis of the situation, do you feel like something has changed in the in the last year, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=558.4000000000001s)]
*  even in terms of the way that in terms of the way that people have been mobilized in the Western [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=567.5200000000001s)]
*  world? Yeah, when someone asked me where I'm from, I tell him like Palestine, he know he don't tell me [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=575.2s)]
*  Pakistan. Oh, yeah. A lot of this thing having to me before like, so maybe it's like a big shift. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=581.12s)]
*  A new generation now knows better. And they know like the struggle of Palestinians. And a lot of [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=590.48s)]
*  people support now our right to resist the occupation because everyone who's living under [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=598.64s)]
*  occupation have the right to resist the occupation in every means he can. So yeah, but we couldn't [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=603.76s)]
*  have the real support on the ground. So no army moved his tanks to support us as Palestinians. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=610.48s)]
*  I think the occupation, no one entered because they I will protect the civilians. Yeah, so in a [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=617.2s)]
*  way you feel that no one is easy as a human from outside, that you deserve like to protect you. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=623.52s)]
*  And we've been like asking for international protection from Israeli occupation for [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=630.72s)]
*  long years, but nobody did anything. So yeah, okay. We're doing our best just to maybe survive [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=635.44s)]
*  to prove to the world that we we need your support to resist this occupation and to have our rights [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=645.9200000000001s)]
*  in our land. Yeah. How do you how do you foresee this going? Like do you do you feel like something [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=652.0s)]
*  has changed in terms of the way that people view Israel now? In in there, I say even contentious [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=657.36s)]
*  terms, where I am a I believe that that the the actions that Israel has taken, post October 7 has [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=665.2s)]
*  genuinely dramatically altered, I think like the continuation of the apartheid in the way that it [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=676.08s)]
*  does. Do you have some semblance of hope in all of this darkness about potentially a trajectory [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=680.8000000000001s)]
*  change for Israel? Yeah, maybe a lot of countries recognize Palestine as a country now as a state, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=688.48s)]
*  because there was a lot of countries didn't recognize Palestine as a state and a lot of [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=697.6s)]
*  countries going to recognize Palestine as a state. A lot of people now know the truth of [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=701.2s)]
*  Israel as occupation. And a lot of people now understand that our war, our fight is not with [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=707.2s)]
*  like Jewish people, it's with Zionism, because there's a lot of thousands of Jewish people, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=715.2s)]
*  maybe 100,000 Jewish people supporting us, because there's also a Palestinian Jewish people. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=720.5600000000001s)]
*  So because there was like a really big understand misunderstand before this, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=725.6800000000001s)]
*  because, yeah, they're using the words like anti semitism to, you know, to block you from [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=730.8000000000001s)]
*  doing what you what you're do your country. So yeah, raising awareness, I hope maybe there's a [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=736.96s)]
*  weak hope, because it's been like almost a year now. And nobody did anything watching people [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=742.88s)]

*  It operates in a similar way to how world central kitchen operates in the way that like when world [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=2000.24s)]
*  central kitchen goes to different places, they will hire people. They will hire like the local [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=2004.24s)]

*  and remove on was legitimacy for a multitude of different reasons. Like when they were able [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=2051.6s)]
*  to successfully do that by just straight up lying and the American government, you know, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=2058.32s)]

*  yet another way to, to increase the hurt that it was causing to the Palestinian population. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=2070.6400000000003s)]

*  for other ways journalists can cover the effects in the U S yeah, you can push in your government [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=2907.04s)]
*  to send you to Gaza so you can work there on the ground to the truth. Because yeah, if you, if you [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=2912.0s)]
*  give the government, give Israel billions of dollars, at least let's, let's Israel allow the [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=2918.96s)]
*  U S journalists to go to Gaza to cover. And I don't, they should not be there. So that's what I [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=2925.1200000000003s)]
*  believe, man. I think for all of everything you do. Yeah. Is one of your photos was the Times [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=2931.2s)]
*  top 10 photos of 2023. Yeah. Here we'll show that one. This is a young girl stuck under her house in [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=2937.6s)]
*  the rubble. This is your photo. Yeah. So my photo, I use my camera to define her. I used like the, [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=2944.96s)]
*  the slow shutter speed, the camera so I can have more light and fire because they couldn't find her. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=2951.52s)]
*  She was screaming when no one knows where she so yeah, thanks for the technology. Yeah. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=2958.08s)]
*  The link is broken. The donate. Why what's going on? What's wrong with the link chat? Hold on. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=2963.12s)]
*  Is it not working? Is it tiltify link not working? [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=2968.96s)]
*  Doors open. Okay. People are saying it works fine. This connect account connect currently make live [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=2978.56s)]
*  changes. What? Okay. I'm a photo editor at the New York Times. I'm wondering if Montaz could share [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=2983.68s)]
*  us share with us the damage the media narrative around Gaza has caused and how us as photographers [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=2988.64s)]
*  and reporters can do better to cover the story. Not sure because like New York Times maybe [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=2993.52s)]
*  sometimes I see some points on them, but they also trying to catch up to show more. Yeah. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3001.3599999999997s)]
*  Like even like once of time CNN showed like videos of young children were just playing [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3008.56s)]
*  and Israeli drawn them and they showed a photo even was graphics, but they, you know, sometimes [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3016.08s)]
*  you just like show it to get more views and to make people satisfied about them to not keep [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3021.84s)]
*  attacking them. Then they don't post anything. They go back to be on the Israeli side. Yeah. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3026.88s)]
*  So I hope they're just not manipulating with this because this is our people's life. And yeah, [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3032.24s)]
*  if you're, if anyone think he's a human, I don't think he should like do this other people to use [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3042.72s)]
*  their, their suffer and I've just to get more views, likes or shares. Yeah. Yeah. Do you, [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3048.3999999999996s)]
*  do you feel like you, you actually brought up something that I talk about quite frequently, [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3055.8399999999997s)]
*  which is that the media, yeah, not like the theory has the theoretical responsibility of like [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3060.0s)]
*  showing the truth, right? Obviously, but the real responsibility, the real goal of the media overall, [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3069.28s)]
*  in my opinion in America, especially is to create an air of objectivity. Yeah. So they can come [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3076.32s)]
*  across as legitimate so they can in more nefarious ways lie when they need to. Yeah. Right. And, [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3084.48s)]
*  and that is, that is the way I, that's the way I see it for the most part. And I think you kind of [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3094.0s)]
*  brought that up when you said like, sometimes they do show the truth. Yeah. And I think as, [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3099.6s)]
*  as a Palestinian, do you feel like they are potentially showing the truth in an effort to [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3105.28s)]
*  maintain that legitimacy because people are yelling at them? Yeah, exactly. So they can [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3109.44s)]
*  continue being like, oh, you know, so they can continue using passive voice whenever they talk [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3113.52s)]
*  about like Israel striking densely populated civilian areas. That is what's really happening. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3119.36s)]
*  That's what I believe is happening for myself personally, is what I believe in. Yeah. And there [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3125.7599999999998s)]
*  are, by the way, chatters, yes, this is something that I repeat all the time. There are great [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3132.24s)]
*  journalists out there, even in the New York Times as well. It's, it's not entirely in their hands, [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3136.96s)]
*  unfortunately, whenever they want to cover a story in a particular manner, there is still obviously [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3142.88s)]
*  going to be editorial control that shuts it down. Have you, are you familiar with Ta-Nehisi Coates? [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3148.7200000000003s)]
*  Ta-Nehisi Coates? Ta-Nehisi Coates. No. So he's a, he's a liberal journalist. He actually even [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3156.7200000000003s)]
*  worked for the Atlantic, which is the editor-in-chief of the Atlantic is the Israeli prison guard, [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3163.04s)]
*  former Israeli prison guard. And he had written extensively about in the past, he had written [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3168.16s)]
*  extensively about reparations and had used Israel as a successful example of how Germany paid [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3175.68s)]
*  reparations to Israel and the creation of the Israeli state in the aftermath of the Holocaust. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3182.08s)]
*  But then Ta-Nehisi Coates actually went to the West Bank and saw for himself what the situation [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3187.2s)]
*  looked like. And as an adult in his thirties, he went there and he was shocked by the realities. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3192.16s)]
*  And now as a very famous journalist and a writer, he has now basically made it his life's mission to [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3199.7599999999998s)]
*  correct the record on that and has apologized profusely time and time again for the role that he [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3205.8399999999997s)]
*  found himself playing about, you know, legitimizing this apartheid state. And, [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3212.8799999999997s)]
*  and it's really interesting watching his reception originally that was very positive, [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3219.44s)]
*  like broadly very popular reception change almost overnight as soon as he started saying that, [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3227.52s)]
*  saying the truth that Israel is an apartheid. Yeah. Now look like what's happening in Iraq [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3234.7200000000003s)]
*  after millions of people got, and now then they couldn't find like any mass destruction missiles. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3240.6400000000003s)]
*  And then Donald Trump showed and he said there was no mass destruction weapons there now, [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3248.56s)]
*  you know, like, but no one even sued like what here his name even. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3255.6s)]
*  George Obivus. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3260.08s)]
*  Yeah, about what he did there. So yeah, the same for Tony. Okay. Thanks for [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3261.12s)]
*  going and discovering the truth by himself, but also others can go. A lot of everyone can go there [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3266.24s)]
*  and discover and see the truth on the ground, but they just don't want to sacrifice some time in [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3273.44s)]
*  airplane to go and see the truth. If you don't, if you just like don't believe media, go by yourself [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3279.6s)]
*  there and see. Like others, there are a lot of people went there and saw the truth, but the [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3285.84s)]
*  problem is with the one even who goes there and stands was right. It was like what he believes in [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3292.32s)]
*  and like continued support Israel and occupying every land in Palestine, studying more lands, [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3299.04s)]
*  making new settlements and not allowing us to move even in our lands. So me as a Palestinian, [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3305.52s)]
*  I need like a permission to move in my country and I can get, yeah. So that's a lot people can [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3312.4s)]
*  understand. People can see, people can know. So if they want, they can find out. Yeah, it's come from [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0eakt16abg&t=3319.7599999999998s)]
