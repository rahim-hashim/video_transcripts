# Modi Was FORCED To Answer An Interview With Trump | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4)
*  We didn't have October 7th. Nothing was happening. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=0.0s)]
*  Mr. Modi, sir, do you like mangoes? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=4.32s)]
*  He's not going to do anything because Iran did not have much money at that point. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=6.4s)]
*  Trump probably looks at that and is like, damn, Modi runs. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=9.68s)]
*  CNN, former news conferences live taking questions. Trump said he does. He can't [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=17.12s)]
*  understand a word the Indian reporters say. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=20.8s)]
*  I will do a few questions, please. Please go ahead. Please go ahead. Yeah. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=22.8s)]
*  Blue shirt. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=30.88s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. People in India will naturally welcome your decision to [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=34.56s)]
*  extradite to India back home. In that context, I'd like to ask you a question about in last [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=39.04s)]
*  few years, we have seen several groups in the U.S. being raising anti-India voice, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  calling about separation terrorism activities in India. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=50.24s)]
*  Do you think that should continue here in the U.S. as well? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  You're going to have to go louder. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  Mr. President, people in India would be welcoming your decision to extradite the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=58.56s)]
*  Hubei Rana to India. I can't understand a word he's saying. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=62.4s)]
*  May I, sir? May I? May I, sir? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=65.84s)]
*  Oh, my God. Go ahead back there. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=70.48s)]
*  Mr. President, thank you. First, I want to ask the Prime Minister a question. You and the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=71.76s)]
*  President, you both spoke about combating ISIS. You both sounded very exciting about this. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=77.76s)]
*  This has got to be about this partnership upcoming. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=82.0s)]
*  And I was curious, how much more confident are you with President Trump leading this country [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=86.24s)]
*  that there will be peace through strength and you will have a successful partnership with the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=92.88s)]
*  United States? Dude, I hate this new formation. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=97.92s)]
*  I hate it. They have these like random Breitbart guys who are like, Mr. President, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=100.56s)]
*  I'll have it on good authority that your dick is long and fat. Mr. President, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=105.6s)]
*  can you tell me how hard you can blow up my back walls? Dude, I'm with the milk boys. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=111.6s)]
*  We're going to have a fantastic relationship. And it has been like the whole world has been [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=118.16s)]
*  set back over the literally tens of your decades of journalism down the damn drain. Okay. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=122.56s)]
*  Straight up room filled to the fucking brim with industry plants that are like, Mr. President, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=131.12s)]
*  I'm with the doodoo kaka coalition. You just gave us press access and you kicked out those [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=138.0s)]
*  fucking losers over at Associated Press. Now I have the standing position here and I'm here, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=143.92s)]
*  sir. Will you give me permission to do tricks on it? Okay. Will you blast sweet ropes into my [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=150.64s)]
*  butthole, Mr. President? I'll freaking love you dog. I don't even have a question. I'm here to [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=157.36s)]
*  just tell you that you're the great one. Oh, it's literally insane. Okay. They're going to have [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=162.8s)]
*  asthma gold in there being like, Mr. President, sir. Will you make titties in video games larger? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=168.16000000000003s)]
*  That's what we're doing. That's the next step. Mr. President, sir. Korean titties are dominating [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=175.52s)]
*  the American marketplace. Can we make sure that Western titties are also fappable in video games [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=181.76000000000002s)]
*  in India to bring him to justice? But there are many other elements in the United States of America, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=188.4s)]
*  particularly calisthenics separatists who've been working against Indian interests. How's the United [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=194.8s)]
*  States of America going to cooperate on that front with India? There have been allegations [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=200.96s)]
*  that have been leveled against. Will you let India resonate calisthenics separatists on US soil, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=207.28s)]
*  just like we did in Canada, sir? Well, I don't think India had a very good relationship with [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=214.0s)]
*  the Biden administration. Biden, they wouldn't sell them oil and gas, which is rather hard to [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=218.32000000000002s)]
*  believe because, you know, it's a good thing to do. And a lot of things happened that weren't very [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=223.60000000000002s)]
*  appropriate, I thought, between India and the administration, the Biden administration. But [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=229.36s)]
*  as you said, we're giving a very violent man, it seems to me. I mean, I don't know that he's [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=234.72000000000003s)]
*  been convicted yet or will be, but let's assume he's a pretty violent person. We're giving him back [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=240.32s)]
*  to India immediately. And there are more to follow because we have quite a few requests. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=246.79999999999998s)]
*  So we work with India on crime and we want to make it good for India. And it's very important. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=252.56s)]
*  So that is very important to us. Okay. Go ahead, please. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=258.15999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. Mr. President, you've repeatedly called India a big abuser of trade and said it is really [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=263.76s)]
*  difficult to do business in India because of tariffs. You announced reciprocal tariffs today. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=274.08s)]
*  I am hoping you can speak about what kind of reciprocal tariffs India can expect. Are you [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=279.68s)]
*  willing to make any concessions? And how can India head off these tariffs? I also have one [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=285.44s)]
*  for the Prime Minister. Well, India has been to us just about the highest tariffed [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=290.96s)]
*  nation anywhere in the world. They've been very strong on tariffs. And I don't blame them [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=297.84s)]
*  necessarily, but it's a different way of doing business. It's very hard to sell into India because [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=302.47999999999996s)]
*  they have trade barriers, very strong tariffs. We are right now a reciprocal nation. We are [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=307.91999999999996s)]
*  going to, if it's India or if it's somebody else with low tariffs, we're going to have the same. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=315.59999999999997s)]
*  We're going to have whatever India charges, we're charging them whatever another country [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=320.24s)]
*  charges, we're charging them. So it's called reciprocal, which I think is a very fair way. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=323.84000000000003s)]
*  We didn't have that. We I was going to do that in my other term and we had the greatest economy [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=329.28000000000003s)]
*  ever in the world. There's never been an economy like we had. And then we got hit with COVID. We [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=334.8s)]
*  had a focus on that. And I wasn't really in the mood to be putting it on Italy and Spain and France [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=340.0s)]
*  and India, frankly, and a lot of other countries because the world was very troubled until we got [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=347.2s)]
*  rid of that nightmare. But we had the strongest economy anywhere in the world during that fairly [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=351.92s)]
*  long period of time during my first term, as you know. And we didn't do the tariffs. We would have [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=358.0s)]
*  done the reciprocal tariffs. But we decided and I decided, I think on a human basis, on a humane [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=364.48s)]
*  basis, not to do them because of the fact that there was such suffering all over the world. The [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=371.03999999999996s)]
*  last thing we needed to talk about is trade problems. But now we do. We're doing we see a [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=375.68s)]
*  tremendous future for our country. But we felt that now it's finally time after 45 or 50 years [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=382.16s)]
*  of abuse that we will do. And this isn't India. This is among a lot of nations. The European [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=388.08s)]
*  Union is very difficult for us. Very, very difficult. They tax our companies at levels [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=395.52s)]
*  that nobody's ever seen before. They take advantage of a lot of things. So we're not [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=401.36s)]
*  happy about that. China, of course, is terrible. And we've never taken in ten cents until I was [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=405.2s)]
*  president. We've taken in hundreds of billions of dollars from China since I've been president in [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=410.8s)]
*  first term and now. And we have to do that just as a mechanism of fairness. And that's what I've done. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=416.0s)]
*  And so we are being reciprocal with India, whatever India charges, we charge them. So, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=423.68s)]
*  frankly, it no longer matters to us that much what they charge because whatever they charge. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=430.0s)]
*  I had discussions with India in the first term about the fact that their tariffs were very high [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=435.52s)]
*  and I was unable to get a concession. So we're just going to do it the easy way. And we're just [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=441.84s)]
*  going to say whatever you charge, we charge. And I think that's fair for the people of the United [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=447.12s)]
*  States. And I think it's actually fair for India. Okay. Are you willing to make any concessions? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=451.2s)]
*  So what? So what does that mean? Yeah, tariffs are the reason that Modi is there. Modi may ask [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=459.52s)]
*  the Trump admin to drop charges on Guatam Adani. The New York court has pressed. But I think, yes, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=466.24s)]
*  tariffs first and foremost is the reason why he's meeting with illegal immigration. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=473.2s)]
*  And India has been cooperating on this issue. How does India see this issue in the larger context? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=476.96s)]
*  Thank you. I don't think this is a question that is about India only, but even globally, you can [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=482.96s)]
*  talk about this issue. And we are of the opinion that anybody who enters another country illegally, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=493.52s)]
*  they, they have absolutely no. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=507.12s)]
*  Cuck. He sent back undocumented immigrants of Indian descent in a military plane. And obviously [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=513.28s)]
*  when you're a nationalist, that's a major L for you. And it apparently made the news in India. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=520.88s)]
*  People were very mad. And now he has to turn around and be like, no, it's great that he did [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=527.2s)]
*  it in handcuffs. My glorious leader are fully prepared to take them back to India. However, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=531.68s)]
*  it doesn't stop there. These are children of very ordinary families and they always [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=540.96s)]
*  funny how to get their news from tick tock moms, lol Trump for the win. There is dearest. No, no, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=549.52s)]
*  no, you can't ban this guy. This guy's my favorite guy. Are you kidding me? Please never banned this [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=554.72s)]
*  guy. Are you joking? That's a right-wing hog that thinks it is the left that's getting their news [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=559.68s)]
*  from tick tock moms. Well, simultaneously, if he's a right-winger, he thinks all news is fake news. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=567.28s)]
*  That's my new favorite guy. He thinks random shit on Twitter is real human trafficking. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=573.3599999999999s)]
*  And basically the, the, the young vulnerable, poor people of India are fooled into coming over [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=581.04s)]
*  as illegal immigrants. And our bigger fight actually is against this ecosystem or this system [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=588.96s)]
*  that encourages such gangs to thrive. And India will completely support their Muslim. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=595.68s)]
*  It's the Muslims that are building the gangs. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=601.76s)]
*  And if I have the ship Indian migrants, if I may, I wanted to ask you, did you discuss any possible [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=606.24s)]
*  business deals with Elon Musk during your, your meetings today? Mr. Prime Minister and Mr. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=612.48s)]
*  President, I wanted to ask you today, you spoke about hoping to have three-way talks with President [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=618.08s)]
*  Xi and President Putin, but what would you say to European leaders and other allies who may be [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=624.64s)]
*  concerned that you're apparently more keen to speak to America's adversaries than to its allies? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=630.64s)]
*  Thank you. Well, maybe I'll just go in first on this one. We had some talks and we told the European [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=636.88s)]
*  union, we told the NATO people largely they overlap. You have to pay more money because [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=648.08s)]
*  it's unfair what we're doing. We're doing a tremendous amount more. We're probably $200 billion [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=655.6s)]
*  more going into Ukraine, using for Ukraine to fight. And Europe has not really carried its weight [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=661.0400000000001s)]
*  in terms of the money. It's not equitable. And we want to see a counterbalance. We want to have them [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=670.72s)]
*  put up more money. They have to do that. At the same time, we had a very good conversation with [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=677.4399999999999s)]
*  President Putin the other day, yesterday, and we also had a very good conversation. I did both, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=681.92s)]
*  in both cases, with President Zelensky. And I think we're going to be able to do something. I [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=687.4399999999999s)]
*  think we're going to be able to make a deal. And I hope so because it's a horrible war. It's a very [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=693.28s)]
*  terrible, bloody war with a million and a half soldiers, at least already dead on the battlefield, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=698.0s)]
*  lying all over the fields like nobody's ever seen anything like it since certainly since the [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=703.2s)]
*  second world war. And so I think we're going to be able to do something. We're working with [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=707.9200000000001s)]
*  President Zelensky and with President Putin. And my impression is that I know that he's going to [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=714.32s)]
*  tear up Ukraine next, but I know that President Putin wants to make a deal. I wanted to know that [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=721.2s)]
*  before I began any detailed discussions, the most beautiful word in the language, the conversation [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=727.2s)]
*  also the meeting with Steve Witkoff in Moscow was a very successful one. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=733.2s)]
*  And my phone call with him was a very successful one. Please. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=738.08s)]
*  You asked a question regarding Elon Musk. I have known him for a very long time. I was not even [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=748.08s)]
*  Prime Minister at the time when I first met him. I was Chief Minister. And today he came to meet me [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=756.1600000000001s)]
*  along with all his family with his children. And so we had a nice discussion. As far as [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=762.64s)]
*  EV is concerned, EV is a concern. The EV, the word EV has a copyright. And that is one person [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=772.88s)]
*  who has a copyright for the word EV and that is Trump. What? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=783.36s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. Can I ask whether you discussed at all today the case of Ghatam Adani, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=792.64s)]
*  who's one of the wealthiest men in Asia and perceived as an ally of Prime Minister Modi? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=801.12s)]
*  Prime Minister Modi, have you asked the president to take action on that case? Thank you. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=805.84s)]
*  Arun was correct. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=811.68s)]
*  Firstly, India is a democratic country. And our culture and our thought philosophy is [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=813.12s)]
*  which basically means that the entire world is a family. Every Indian is my own family member. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=825.6s)]
*  And when it comes to such personal matters, two leaders of two countries will not get together [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=832.32s)]
*  on that topic and discuss anything on an individual matter. Go ahead, please. Yeah, please. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=839.68s)]
*  Sir, go ahead. He said it's just a little bit of bribes. OK, why are you getting in the way? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=849.4399999999999s)]
*  For you as well. But Mr. President, you have suggested with regards to the Russia Ukraine [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=855.1999999999999s)]
*  war, you've suggested several things that Ukraine should give up the idea of NATO membership [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=859.8399999999999s)]
*  territory that was seized back in 2014 by Russia. What should Russia give up? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=865.76s)]
*  Russia has gotten themselves into something that I think they wish they didn't. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=872.2399999999999s)]
*  If I were president, it would not have happened. Absolutely would not have happened. And it didn't [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=877.4399999999999s)]
*  happen for four years. If you look at what has taken place under the Adani case is that he got [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=882.3199999999999s)]
*  caught with hundreds of millions of dollars of bribes to basically dominate what like the solar [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=890.32s)]
*  energy sector. And it's one of those things that administrations do where they'll pull on certain [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=896.0s)]
*  like it's not because they want to follow the law or whatever, but it's because they probably [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=903.6800000000001s)]
*  wanted to add a pressure point. Ukraine. And when you look at the mess that they're in, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=909.12s)]
*  it's got to be ended and it's got to be stopped. Now Russia has taken over [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=914.8800000000001s)]
*  a pretty big chunk of territory. And they also have said from day one, long before president [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=919.76s)]
*  Putin, they've said they cannot have Ukraine be a NATO. They said that very strongly. I actually [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=927.3599999999999s)]
*  think that that was the thing that caused the start of the war. And Biden said it and [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=932.7199999999999s)]
*  Zelensky said it. And I think that was one of the reasons, one of the starts of the war. But from [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=938.8s)]
*  long before Putin, they said you cannot have Ukraine going in any way into NATO. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=944.64s)]
*  Thanks, man. And I start from that standpoint. I think everybody knew that. I'm sorry. I should [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=952.56s)]
*  have said that the American government and district attorneys actually do care about the [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=958.0s)]
*  letter of the law and certainly will prosecute especially foreign criminals because they care [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=965.68s)]
*  about the law and not because they want to apply pressure, pressure that I am admitting. I don't [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=973.92s)]
*  know what their true purpose was when they're prosecuting the second wealthiest person in India. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=980.0799999999999s)]
*  I know this from my own personal experience with how the American government operates against Turkey [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=986.7199999999999s)]
*  regularly. But I will say as far as NATO is concerned from many years before president Putin, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=992.56s)]
*  I will tell you that I've heard that Russia would never accept that. And I think Ukraine knew that [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=998.88s)]
*  because Ukraine wasn't in and never requested to be in until more recently. So that's the way it is. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1004.16s)]
*  And I think that's the way it's going to have to be. Go ahead, please. All right, go ahead, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1009.68s)]
*  please. With the tie. With the tie. Yeah. Mr. President. Yes, go ahead. This is from News [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1014.48s)]
*  Mobile. Mr. President, you spoke about Prime Minister Modi as a tough negotiator. Who was [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1021.2s)]
*  a tougher negotiator today and who has a better negotiating? I'm sorry. Okay, dude. The Indian [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1026.24s)]
*  journalists allowed into the room are hand selected by Modi's team. I think it is insane. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1032.32s)]
*  The questions coming from the white journalists, the Western journalists are also insane, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1038.56s)]
*  but there is an additional level of glaze coming from the Indian journalists. How do you see? One [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1045.04s)]
*  of them didn't even ask a question. They just said, you are the king of EV. What the fuck is [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1050.08s)]
*  going on in this room, man? Ukraine and Russia conflict. Well, I think we're going to have a [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1055.84s)]
*  very good relationship with China. I got along with President Xi very well until COVID that was [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1060.6399999999999s)]
*  bridged too far. But until then, I got along with President Xi very, very well. We were. That's [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1065.52s)]
*  because Modi has never held a press conference. Well, he still is not holding a press conference. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1070.72s)]
*  You cannot consider this a fucking press conference. This is crazy. CNN cut away from it. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1074.8799999999999s)]
*  The White House answering reporters questions right now. The Prime Minister. Would you have [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1081.36s)]
*  it different? Like if you were president? Yeah. I mean, you're supposed to have a different, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1085.6s)]
*  okay. What do you mean? That's crazy. It leads to at least to create, at least to create like [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1090.32s)]
*  the aesthetics of, of discourse. It's ridiculous. Strong nuclear power. He's not very close to Russia [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1099.12s)]
*  or the United States right now, but he will be soon. I mean, he'll, he'll catch up over the period [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1106.6399999999999s)]
*  of four or five years. Didn't Modi have an interview where they asked me, Mr. President, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1110.9599999999998s)]
*  do you have any close friends or no, it was what did you eat for lunch? We're going to spend this [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1114.0s)]
*  year 900, let's say $915 billion on military Russia without the war was spending close to a [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1117.76s)]
*  hundred. But with the war, I can't tell you what they're spending, but they're spending a lot in [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1126.56s)]
*  China spending 400 and 450 billion dollars. We're over $900 billion. And I said, you know, it doesn't [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1130.16s)]
*  really make sense as it we're spending the money against each other and we could spend that money [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1138.08s)]
*  for better purpose if we got along. And I'll tell you, I think that something like that will happen [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1144.0s)]
*  first. When I left, as you know, four years ago, we didn't have Israel and the middle East. We [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1150.24s)]
*  didn't have October 7th. Do you disaster, the disaster, nothing was happening. Mr. Modi, sir, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1156.72s)]
*  do you like mangoes? Gonna do anything because Iran did not have much money at that point. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1162.8799999999999s)]
*  Trump probably looks at that and is like, damn, Modi runs, dude, I love that. I need more Breitbart [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1167.52s)]
*  journalists in this fucking room to ask me if I eat mangoes too. But now I come back and I have [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1171.92s)]
*  the whole world is on fire. So I have to put out the fires. But after I put out the fires, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1177.04s)]
*  I'm going to meet with China and I'm going to meet with Russia and we're going to see if we can [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1181.6s)]
*  deescalate it. We can bring it down military, especially as it pertains to nuclear. Please. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1185.04s)]
*  Mike, please. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1198.08s)]
*  Prime Minister, how do you see India's role? You have had discussions with President Trump [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1208.72s)]
*  about deescalating the conflict in Russia and Ukraine. As you know, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1216.8799999999999s)]
*  I have been in constant contact with both Russia and Ukraine. I have also visited both countries [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1222.4s)]
*  and many people are mistaken and they feel that India is neutral. I would like to clarify, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1230.3200000000002s)]
*  India is not neutral. We have taken a side and we have taken the side of peace. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1238.3200000000002s)]
*  And it is based on this principle of ours that in the presence of President Putin, I clearly said [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1248.08s)]
*  in front of the media that this is not the era of war. And even today, it is my conviction that [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1256.0s)]
*  solutions cannot be found on the battlefield. But I have seen the world is on fire. And I have [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1263.1999999999998s)]
*  conviction that solutions cannot be found on the battlefield. Ultimately, you have to come to the [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1271.84s)]
*  negotiating table. And India has constantly made efforts that there are talks that take place where [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1280.24s)]
*  both parties are present. It is only then that we will find a solution. The efforts being made [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1289.6s)]
*  by President Trump, I support them, I welcome them, and I would like that President Trump is [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1296.96s)]
*  successful as soon as possible so that the world is on the path to peace once again. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1306.72s)]
*  Everybody, thank you very much. Thank you very much. And I very much appreciate the Prime Minister [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1314.32s)]
*  visiting our great country. And I do really appreciate it. We have so much in common and [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1319.92s)]
*  all we want to do is have peace and we want to have strength and we want to have lots of [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1324.64s)]
*  different things together. But the relationship with India and with the Prime Minister has never [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1328.48s)]
*  been better. Thank you very much. Oh, they definitely have a lot in common. That much is true, baby. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1333.44s)]
*  CNN fact check. Oh my God. Right now we're joined by CNN's new senior political and global affairs [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1339.68s)]
*  commentator, Robin Manuel. Thanks so much for joining us here. So you know this. Oh my God. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1345.6000000000001s)]
*  Oh my God. This fucking dipshit. Oh, the great defiler of the Democratic Party, a person who [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1352.24s)]
*  got one of the sweetest gigs of all time. He talks about the war in Ukraine. He never mentioned that [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1363.36s)]
*  it was Russia that invaded. It's not like it's just a war appeared like immaculate conception. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1370.48s)]
*  He never refers to how it started. He then, and you take a look at this, there's a reason why, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1376.08s)]
*  and there's reporting that Kremlin is high-fiving each other. And in the Munich conference and in [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1382.8799999999999s)]
*  Keith, they're ringing your hands before even the negotiations started. He's agreed that [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1386.96s)]
*  Ukraine can never be part of NATO. Well, how about Ukraine can join the EU, the market, which is. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1393.4399999999998s)]
*  Okay. In Japan, he was kind of great because he just made Twitter posts in Japanese about how great [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1399.6799999999998s)]
*  trains are. I have it on good authority that apparently he played a role in the LDP pushing for [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1405.04s)]
*  LDP pushing for, I think it was like some kind of like legislation for, I think it was gay marriage [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1418.32s)]
*  when other people's pushing for gay marriage. He came out and he tweeted about it saying like, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1424.8s)]
*  finally, Japan is actually doing the right thing about gay people or whatever. And all of the [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1430.0s)]
*  opposition parties, all of the opposition parties use that as a reason to tank it. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1436.8s)]
*  Like they were like, Oh, look, see, this is like American woke culture. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1444.72s)]
*  By the way, speaking of American hogs dominating discourse all around the globe, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1450.32s)]
*  this is also a major point of contention, even in a place like Japan, which I would say is [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1455.6s)]
*  for the most part, servile to American interests. What I'm literally a JCP member. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1459.92s)]

*  statements to say American woke culture is ruining Japan. There's also a really funny story about [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1490.16s)]
*  Ubisoft that I haven't talked about yet. Remember the original reception to, remember the original [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1496.8s)]
*  reception to Ubisoft, the, the new Ubisoft Assassin's Creed game coming out. That's going [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1503.28s)]

*  this is yet another Testament to how like even the likes of Asmongold, for example, can corrupt [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1548.4s)]
*  the minds of the Japanese right wing. They have their own version of a far right hogs in Japan. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1553.84s)]
*  Remember Twitter is very commonly used in Japan. As a matter of fact, there's a higher percentage, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1561.36s)]
*  if I'm not mistaken of Twitter users in Japan than even the United States of America. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1566.8s)]
*  And for that reason, Japan has also become increasingly more right wing far right on [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1571.36s)]

*  Andes of Japan were claiming is that they actually put Yosuke in to the video game so that they can [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1590.16s)]
*  claim the Western powers. They can claim that Japanese people also did slavery to black people [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1598.96s)]
*  so that they will force the Japanese government to pay reparations to Black Lives Matter [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1608.0800000000002s)]
*  and black people and allow black African immigrants into the country. And that is this [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1615.28s)]
*  massive 5D gambit, this five dimensional chess play from Ubisoft to bring in unlimited immigration [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1622.88s)]

*  to Korea over the comfort women situation, which they also claim is a lie that didn't happen. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1643.76s)]
*  Wrap your fucking head around that dude. Imagine being so goddamn captive to American brain rot [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1651.44s)]
*  that you turn around and get mad about a cherished figure in Japanese mythology. Okay. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1659.2s)]
*  Because Americans decided to get mad racially about it. You also deny the pleasure squads [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1669.28s)]
*  in North Korea. What are you talking about, dude? What? Japanese history, sorry, not even mythology, [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSFfOetujk4&t=1675.04s)]
