# Trump Holds Press Conference With The WORST French President | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y)
*  Maybe the piss daves are real. No, I don't think I don't think there's anything that would harm him. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=0.0s)]
*  I don't think like Donald Trump with the with the exception of like literally bring a baby. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=4.16s)]
*  Okay. On camera and then eating the baby. There's not much that is going to cause people to go. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=9.84s)]
*  Oh, that's a bridge too far for me. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=15.36s)]
*  Donald Trump is holding a live press conference alongside French president Macron now. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  Mr. Peace and I think we're going to do it. We've had some great conversations, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=26.64s)]
*  including with Russia. Since my return to the White House, we've made more progress toward that [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  goal in one month than occurred in the past three years. And I've spoken with both president [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=36.72s)]
*  Putin and president Zelensky and again, who's a dictator and I hate him. A lot of good things [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  toward peace are happening. Moving it. Did Carl, that man trying to reach out to you? Tell him to [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=50.16s)]
*  hit me on on this. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=55.68s)]
*  Rubio National Security Advisor Michael Walz and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff conducted successful [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=57.28s)]
*  talks in Saudi Arabia with the delegation from Russia. And I'd like to thank the Kingdom of [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=65.12s)]
*  Saudi Arabia and the King and Mohammed. Great people really working hard to get this done. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=71.52000000000001s)]
*  Our focus is on achieving a ceasefire as soon as possible and ultimately a permanent peace. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=79.6s)]
*  My meeting with President Macron today was another important step forward in that [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=86.88s)]
*  sphere because he's been very much involved right from the beginning in trying to get it over [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=92.96s)]
*  and then we're going to get it done. I believe that Emmanuel agrees with me on many of the most [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=97.52s)]
*  important issues chief among them is this is the right time. It may be the only time, you know, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=102.48s)]
*  that's a very interesting and horrible situation and that could evolve into a [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  third world war. We're not going to let that happen. Should have never started, but it did. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=115.68s)]
*  And what a mess. What a horrible bloody mess. I'm also pleased that President Macron agrees that [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=120.64s)]
*  the cost and burden of securing the peace must be borne by the nations of Europe, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=127.84s)]
*  not alone by the United States. And Europe must take that central role in assuring long-term [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=134.24s)]
*  security of Ukraine, which they want to do. And that's not a very big step. A big step is [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=140.56s)]
*  what's going to happen over the next few weeks. The United States has put up far more aid for [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=146.8s)]
*  Ukraine than any other nation. Hundreds of billions of dollars. We've spent more than [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=153.6s)]
*  300 billion and Europe has spent about 100. 100 billion, that's a big difference. And at some [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=158.88s)]
*  point we should equalize, but hopefully we won't have to worry about that. We have other things [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  happening that maybe take that out of the realm of necessity. And while we've given vast amounts [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=171.6s)]
*  of military aid and money in form of grants, much of Europe's contribution has been [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=178.24s)]
*  economic relief structured as loans for which they'll be repaid. Like the Europeans, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=183.76s)]
*  I believe that taxpayers and the United States also deserve to recoup the colossal amounts of [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=190.48s)]
*  money that we've sent. The previous administration never even thought of that. They didn't think of a [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=197.04s)]
*  lot of things like why did they let it start in the first place? That is why [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=203.92s)]
*  we must have an agreement with Ukraine on dude. Every time he talks about Russia, I can't believe [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=210.07999999999998s)]
*  I'm, I'm getting, maybe I'm a little too libed up, but every time he talks about Russia, the way he [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=216.0s)]
*  does and the actions that he takes in regards to Russia, I unironically start thinking he is like, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=221.35999999999999s)]
*  like, I mean, he's a, he's going above and beyond, dude. He's going above and beyond, like the, the, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=227.2s)]
*  was Trump a KGB asset memes are becoming reality. Okay. Unfolding in front of my eyes. So [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=234.95999999999998s)]
*  the reason why I say that is because like, I understand wanting to, you know, engage [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=242.16s)]
*  with Russia in the ceasefire talks. This is something that I advocated Biden do as well, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=249.6s)]
*  but this is literally above and beyond, like the UN, the symbolic vote in the UN, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=254.96s)]
*  the consistent undermining of Zelensky, like he goes, he goes far, far above what [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=262.24s)]
*  Trump normally would do in this situation. Like, what the fuck? The first administration, first [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=270.0s)]
*  term, we had no wars, we had no problems. We didn't have October 7th with Israel. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=276.96000000000004s)]
*  We didn't have Russia and Ukraine going at it. Maybe the piss. They've a real, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=282.4s)]
*  nah, I don't think, I don't think there's anything that would harm him. I don't think [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=287.03999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump with the, with the exception of like literally murdering a baby, okay. On camera and [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=290.96s)]
*  then eating the baby. There's not much that is going to cause people to go, Oh, that's a bridge [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=296.64s)]
*  too far for me. I hate this guy now. You know what I mean? Black male only works if you have [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=301.76s)]
*  some semblance of shame and normalcy. Look at Pete Hegsit. Pete Hegsit is unblackmailable. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=308.48s)]
*  He is a drunk rapist and now he is the defense secretary. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=314.71999999999997s)]
*  Check your discord. I wrote you to get a call in with Decarle Dent. Okay, hold on. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=324.64s)]
*  My greatest legacy, however, will be as a peacemaker and a unifier. Did you add, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=329.52s)]
*  did you try to add me? Not war, I think president Macron joining us today in this urgent [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=334.0s)]
*  work we're doing. And we have some wonderful people up front right here that have [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=342.08s)]
*  you try to add me on discord. Michael waltz. Thank you, Scott. Thank you very much. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=346.0s)]
*  Tell my whisper to my mods, what your, what your username is on discord. They've really done a job. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=352.24s)]
*  They worked very hard. It's like it's a real passion to get this war ended. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=356.72s)]
*  What's your stance on Macron as a Frenchman? I'm curious of what others think. I think he is [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=362.32000000000005s)]
*  incredibly bad. He is unimaginably bad and he is, he is almost single-handedly responsible for the [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=368.08000000000004s)]
*  rise of the nationalist movement in France by constantly capitulating to right wing sentiment. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=375.04s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, I'll be saying a few words. He's a horrible racist and I hate him. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=380.72s)]
*  Thank you very much, Mr. President. Dear Donald for your hospitality and for this visit. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=385.6s)]
*  As you mentioned, we have had the opportunity to meet over the past few years since your first [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=392.08000000000004s)]
*  term. We've been able to discuss matters in Paris and also here at the White House. And it has always [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=398.32000000000005s)]
*  been a great joy to do that. And I would like to commend you and thank you, Mr. President, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=405.92s)]
*  for extending this friendship to France and taking part in the ceremony at Notre Dame that you [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=414.72s)]
*  mentioned before. It was a great honor for the French people to reopen the cathedral to the rest [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=420.48s)]
*  of the world. And your presence was a testament to that friendship. As the president said, this [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=426.16s)]
*  friendship dates back to the Revolutionary War since the beginning of the United States. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=433.12s)]
*  And whenever we've needed to, we've been able to come together and be on the right side. We've [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=438.72s)]
*  been able to be united to defend peace and sovereignty, namely in the two world wars [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=445.2s)]
*  that marked the 20th century from Lafayette to Pershing and to [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=453.04s)]
*  the many Americans who landed on Omaha Beach. And we spoke earlier before, and you mentioned that one [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=459.76s)]
*  of those gentlemen was able to visit you here, one of the veterans. This is part of history, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=469.35999999999996s)]
*  which puts us in the world that we are in today. And as the president just said, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=480.15999999999997s)]
*  just said, there are many challenges in this world. And over the past few days, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=484.64000000000004s)]
*  we have one main objective. Can't believe Trump already nutted and Macron still [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=491.84000000000003s)]
*  shitting? Why only fascists? Why not exclude communism too? Seems like an extremely one-sided [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=495.12s)]
*  opinion. Let me explain to you one thing really quickly. Okay. I like communism. I don't care. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=500.24s)]
*  I am not afraid of saying that while I wouldn't consider myself to be a communist, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=507.44000000000005s)]
*  I don't mind communism. I don't mind attempts at moving in the direction of communism. I don't mind [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=512.64s)]
*  this at all. Okay. So that is the reason why I can tell you openly that I agree with anti-capitalist [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=519.68s)]
*  sentiments. Okay. Many transitional socialist states have made tremendous mistakes. It is [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=529.1999999999999s)]
*  important to learn from those mistakes, but this should not mean that we should stop pursuing [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=535.92s)]
*  an evolution of the way that our current political economy, our current modes of production [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=542.24s)]
*  change for the better. So that every single person, yourself included, have a better life. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=548.64s)]
*  Okay. That's it. That is the reason why I'm like, I guess I'm one-sided if you want to consider it [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=555.2s)]
*  that way. Okay. I don't know why you think this is a scary word. I don't know why you think you can [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=561.6800000000001s)]
*  just simply, I guess, not even address why these things are bad and rely on red scare propaganda. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=568.96s)]
*  Okay. Bad way to take in the news, to be honest. Also, cruise for Palestine is a bad movement [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=577.0400000000001s)]
*  because it's a region and country that will kill people who identify as queer just for existing. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=581.76s)]
*  These are all the points I hear during the 10 minutes before I can comment. I would write more, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=585.6s)]
*  but there is a character limit dot dot dot. Okay. Allegiance to people who are undermined by [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=588.96s)]
*  colonial violence should not be transactional regardless. Okay. Your assumption is that, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=596.56s)]
*  you know, they're actually murdering queer people in Palestine on a daily basis. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=602.64s)]
*  And it's true. Queer people are dying in Palestine on a daily basis. It's just that Israel is killing [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=607.4399999999999s)]
*  most of them, the overwhelming majority of them. Okay. But regardless, even if a group of people [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=613.2s)]
*  that were being dominated by a settler colony and its ethno-nationalist project, and they were some [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=620.96s)]
*  of the most backwards thinking reactionary people you've ever seen. And there are plenty of examples [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=628.0s)]
*  of this. Okay. I would still look at the greater evil in that scenario. I would still call out the [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=634.32s)]
*  larger colonial power dominating these people because unlike you, I understand that reactionary [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=640.8000000000001s)]
*  sentiments such as that homophobia, queer phobia in general actually explodes when you are being [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=647.2s)]
*  dominated by a larger power. You have no time to do civil rights protests. Okay. If you left people [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=654.8000000000001s)]
*  alone, if you left people alone, or if you were, you know, living in the United States of America, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=660.96s)]
*  for example, where there are still plenty of issues in terms of queer liberty, people have time [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=667.0400000000001s)]
*  to mobilize against their own governments and be able to advance social liberties. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=674.8s)]
*  Okay. What you are trying to do and failing to do so is an attempt at pink washing to be like, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=681.4399999999999s)]

*  Yeah. He Googled mass killings under communist regimes and literally just literally just this, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=846.3199999999999s)]
*  according to historian class gone Carlson discussions of the number of victims of [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=853.92s)]

*  when you were copy and pasting this exact number, you didn't see the introduction even on [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=862.08s)]
*  Wikipedia that says that there is a tremendous amount of ideological bias. Any attempt to [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=867.6800000000001s)]
*  estimate a total number of killings under communist regimes depends greatly on definitions ranging [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=873.36s)]
*  from a low 10 to 20 million as high as 148 million political. How do you clip chip a [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=876.72s)]
*  Wikipedia article? By the way, this is crazy political science, Rudolph Rimmel and historian, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=882.4000000000001s)]
*  Mark Bradley have written that while the exact numbers have been in dispute, the order of [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=886.08s)]
*  magnitude is not. If you were to utilize the standards of black book of communism in terms [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=888.96s)]
*  of victims, which include not only the Nazis that the USSR killed during world war II, but also [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=895.36s)]
*  the potential children that those Nazis could have had. Okay. After world war II, that's how [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=903.6s)]
*  you arrive at a hundred million number. You understand? Do you feel like this is an appropriate [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=909.52s)]
*  way to do it? Even if you were to attribute famine, for example, directly to the regimes [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=914.72s)]
*  and directly to the political ideology that dictated the regimes, then capitalism kills [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=922.64s)]
*  14 million or eight to 14 million people every year due to famine. Okay. Now in that circumstance, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=929.28s)]
*  you'd be comparing famine to a region that simply always had famine and no abundance whatsoever [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=937.52s)]
*  versus famine under capitalism. Now that still exists at a time when there is abundance. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=946.4s)]

*  literally copied and pasted a Wikipedia page. You know, that's crazy. They're getting, they're [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=962.32s)]

*  how is this happening? We have a shared agenda in that regard. We also spoke about the middle East [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=971.2800000000001s)]
*  among other subjects. And here again, we have the same desire. We don't want to see Iran obtain [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=978.1600000000001s)]

*  type of regional destabilization with respect to Syria and Iraq. We also share the same desire. We [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1001.68s)]

*  leans on the other side of things, the other side of the world, so to speak. But the Harvard poll is [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1130.96s)]
*  a respected poll and it has us not only leading, but leading by a lot and leading on every single [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1136.72s)]
*  issue that we've talked about. And as I said, we've become the party of common sense. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1142.72s)]
*  And I think that's a very important element now, common sense, because what's happening [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1148.88s)]
*  in the world and even in this country, some of the things that took place, many of them are now [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1153.3600000000001s)]

*  back in the day, there was this notion that there was adversarial journalism. And in certain [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1246.56s)]

*  There is a big change because there is a new US administration. So this is a new context. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1372.48s)]
*  Turkey didn't collapse. So then could we just become Turkey forever dictatorship? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1377.76s)]
*  It was President Putin. But my experience is the following, and I shared it with President Trump [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1381.76s)]
*  and the team. In 2014, our predecessors negotiated peace with President Putin. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1386.48s)]
*  But because of the lack of guarantees and especially security guarantees, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1395.68s)]
*  President Putin violated this peace. And I had several discussions, especially beginning of [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1399.84s)]
*  2012. Seven hours with President Putin, 15 days before [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1405.52s)]
*  launching of the attack. He denied everything, but we didn't have security guarantees. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1416.0s)]
*  So this is why being strong and having deterrence capacities is the only way to be sure it will be [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1423.84s)]
*  respected. And I insisted on that. And this is why I believe that the US has the capacity to do so. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1431.28s)]
*  And this is why I think we should never say, I will never send any boots on the ground because [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1440.48s)]
*  you give a blank check to violate any type of commitment. So I think it's good to have [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1444.72s)]
*  discussion. I think it's useful to have negotiation. I think it's super important to go to the peace. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1453.84s)]
*  But my strong point was to say, let's try to get something first, which can be assessed, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1460.3200000000002s)]
*  checked and verified. And let's be sure that we build sufficient guarantees in the short run. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1468.0s)]
*  And this is where we are ready to be engaged. As for France, a lot of my European colleagues [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1473.92s)]
*  are ready to be engaged. But we do need this American backup because this is part of the [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1480.0800000000002s)]
*  credibility of the security guarantees. And this is our collective deterrence capacity. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1485.28s)]
*  And I have the feeling that the President has this capacity. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1491.52s)]
*  I think it's very much to the benefit of Russia to make a deal. And I feel that we'll do that. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1497.44s)]
*  It is what it is. Again, it's a war that should have never been started. It's a war that would [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1505.44s)]
*  not have been started if I were President. But it did start and it's at a terrible level [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1510.0s)]
*  where cities are burned down and shot down to the ground. It looks like demolition sites, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1515.92s)]
*  a whole big pile of demolition sites. And we got to get it stopped. Too many people, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1522.4s)]
*  too much agony. The whole culture is destroyed when you rip down some of those ancient, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1527.84s)]
*  really ancient or near ancient buildings. It's so sad to see. But I think it's very much to the [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1533.52s)]
*  benefit of this tremendous distrust on both sides. That's why it's good that I'm coming in now. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1539.76s)]
*  But I think it's to the — [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1544.72s)]
*  He's going to tell Macron, Ukraine is flat and the only thing that can stop a bullet [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1545.52s)]
*  is a person's body. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1548.8s)]
*  And to go on with — [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1550.64s)]
*  The beautiful domes. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1551.92s)]
*  — go on with leading Russia in a very positive way. That's what you have to do. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1552.8799999999999s)]
*  But I really believe that he wants to make a deal. Maybe wrong, but I believe he wants to make a [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1558.8s)]
*  deal. Yeah, go ahead, please. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1563.28s)]
*  — Mr. President, next week there's a key deadline for your Canada and Mexico — [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1566.24s)]
*  — for the — [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1572.08s)]
*  — if those countries have done enough on the border to stop those from taking effect. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1575.12s)]
*  And for President Macron, I'm wondering if you believe that this critical mineral deal with [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1579.6799999999998s)]
*  Ukraine represents a de facto — [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1584.6399999999999s)]
*  — Bro, Bloomberg, Russian officials are reportedly — wait, no, there is no way this is correct, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1586.8s)]
*  right? Did Bloomberg actually report this? Hold on. Wait. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1592.56s)]
*  Russian officials are reportedly wary of President Trump's strategy, not understanding it. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1598.96s)]
*  They remain cautious about Trump's seeming embrace of Putin. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1602.8s)]
*  This is like when Nick Fuentes was like, yeah, I think you guys got to dial back on the SIG [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1606.72s)]
*  hiling a little bit for me. Okay. Then like what? No. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1612.24s)]
*  What is happening? What is going on? [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1618.72s)]
*  I mean, I'm confused by it too, because he's going above and beyond. Like he is going above [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1621.12s)]
*  and beyond. It's not normal. The level of glaze. No, no, I, the account itself is not verifiable, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1627.1999999999998s)]
*  but they, the account itself is basically taking stuff from, you know, news. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1636.08s)]
*  Phytux is decently reliable. That's not the original account though. This is the Phytux network, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1641.6s)]
*  but they're not coming up with their own news. They're just, look, this is what they're — this [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1646.56s)]
*  is from the Bloomberg article. Officials in Moscow are cautious about Trump's embrace of Putin. Two [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1653.2s)]
*  people with knowledge of the situation said, the Russian leadership doesn't fully understand the [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1657.28s)]
*  White House strategy and is wary of traps. Another person close to the Kremlin said. So he's not — [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1660.72s)]
*  the article is real. It is from Bloomberg. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1666.8799999999999s)]
*  A country will be extremely liquid and rich again. Plus, we're doing other things, as you know. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1668.96s)]
*  Finding tremendous waste, fraud, and abuse at levels that nobody thought possible. You're [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1674.72s)]
*  seeing what's going on. And that was also part of the Harvard poll. Do you agree with what [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1681.28s)]
*  President Trump is doing with Elon and others that are looking for the waste, fraud, and abuse? And [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1686.3200000000002s)]
*  the numbers were staggering. It was like 70 percent to 2 percent. Everybody wants to find [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1692.5600000000002s)]
*  out. They don't like it. And, you know, the radical left or whoever it may be starts screaming [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1698.3200000000002s)]
*  about the Constitution. But it has nothing to do with the Constitution. It has to do with fairness [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1704.08s)]
*  to this country. It has to do with being ripped off. And when you read the things that all of [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1707.84s)]
*  these billions — and I mean many billions, hundreds of billions of dollars — have been spent on, [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1713.28s)]
*  that's all you have to do is stand up here and read them. I could stand up all day and read the [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1719.28s)]
*  kind of things where we're spending all of this money. The good news is that when you think of [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1722.8799999999999s)]
*  how rich a nation we can be when we get rid of this, you know, sometimes you'll buy a company and [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1728.8799999999999s)]
*  you'll see it was really well run. It's — [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1734.0s)]
*  I think one of the wildest things that has happened — and I will openly and [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1736.24s)]
*  I will openly and readily admit this — one of the wildest things that has happened so far, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1740.1599999999999s)]
*  I think, is this is the Vivek Ramaswami plan. Okay? Or at least like something that Vivek [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1745.04s)]
*  Ramaswami was repeating that he got from fucking 4chan or whatever about how the real meta here [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1753.4399999999998s)]
*  should be to realign with Russia because they are also defending Christianity and they're white [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1762.0s)]
*  and they're based and then utilize that allegiance with Russia to undermine China. The real war is [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1767.68s)]
*  China. And at the time, at the time, I thought this is ridiculous. Like this one, I don't think [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1774.8s)]
*  will work. Okay. I don't think that this will be a successful way of undermining. Like they're [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1784.32s)]
*  basically doing the reverse. They're basically doing the opposite of what they did in the Cold [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1790.0s)]
*  War where they had better relationship with — they had better relations with China because they thought [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1796.48s)]
*  that this would undermine the USSR. So I think that that's what they're trying to do with Russia now, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1805.84s)]
*  except the difference is says the Brown bro, bro. Amazing. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1816.64s)]
*  Just, I get a lot of shit. Okay. But that's, that's awesome. I love when someone is just like, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1830.4s)]
*  I'm going to go straight to the point. You are Brown says the Brown press, by the way you refer [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1838.24s)]
*  to Notre Dame and that you were impressed by the reconstruction of Notre Dame. A lot of Americans [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1844.0s)]
*  sent money to Paris to undermine the reconstruction of Notre Dame. As a president of the United States, [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1850.8s)]
*  are you going to talk about you? I don't know who you're talking about. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1857.6s)]
*  President Macron, what the main area of progress in your meeting with president Trump, can you [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1864.16s)]
*  confirm that there is an agreement to send European peacekeeping troops? Will France participate [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1871.04s)]
*  in that? How many troops? What would they be doing? Would this represent a great danger to send [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1877.76s)]
*  French and European troops to Ukraine? Well, I guess it's a little strange question because you [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1884.1599999999999s)]
*  ask whether or not we're going to on behalf of the United States contribute to Ukraine. I mean, [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1890.48s)]
*  we're in there for about $350 billion. I think that's a pretty big contribution. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1895.76s)]
*  I do appreciate the first part of your question, however, because I think they've done an incredible [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1901.12s)]
*  job with the cathedral of Notre Dame. I think the president has done, I know he headed it up. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1905.36s)]
*  Okay. I don't care about Notre Dame. Jeffrey Sachs has the same view that supporting [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1911.6s)]
*  crime for this long was a mistake and the military industrial complex is desperate to make peace with [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1914.8799999999999s)]
*  Russia in order to focus on China. I don't think it's a four-chain meme. Yeah. The problem here [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1918.16s)]
*  is that the allegiance that Russia and China have are directly built on the, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1923.36s)]
*  on the boundaries of them both resisting American empire and Western supremacy. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1930.32s)]
*  So I don't know, like they're not aligned with one another ideologically Russia. I mean, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1937.36s)]
*  and China doesn't really care about ideological boundaries at all, but also Russia is a [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1942.3999999999999s)]
*  right-wing kleptocracy. So I don't even know if that's a successful strategy is what I mean. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1948.64s)]
*  I don't believe Putin will go for it, but whoever comes after Putin is likely to take the U S's [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1955.3600000000001s)]

*  Yeah. Well, yes, I'm going to have German socialist streamer, Dick Carl Dent in a little bit in half [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1963.76s)]
*  an hour. Once we're done with this part of the segment, once we're done with the France talks, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1971.1200000000001s)]
*  I'm going to talk to the, the Carl Dent and talk to him about the German elections. Okay. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1976.08s)]
*  To have a truce, a piece and be able to measure that and then structure our discussions on that [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1983.12s)]
*  basis. France and several other European countries, along with Ukraine are hard at work to build this [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1990.3999999999999s)]
*  lasting piece with very specific points, including security guarantees, the territories that belong [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=1998.24s)]
*  to Ukraine, the issue of reconstruction, the economy and critical minerals. We've been able [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2006.48s)]
*  to go into the details of those proposals. The third area of progress, which really [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2013.28s)]
*  mark a turning point is the fact that we were able to talk about the details of the security [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2021.44s)]
*  guarantees. And the president has shown this over the past few days. And he said so a moment ago, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2026.48s)]
*  we want peace. He wants peace. We want peace, peace swiftly, but we don't want an agreement [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2033.28s)]
*  that is weak. The fact that there are Europeans that are ready to engage to provide for these [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2039.84s)]
*  security guarantees. And now there's a clear American message. Yeah. When he says we're going to take over the minerals, here's the other side of the story. When he says we're going to take over the [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2046.8s)]
*  minerals, I'm not super well versed on the Ukrainian mineral maps. I'm not Pete Buttigieg, who was very well versed on Afghan mineral maps. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2055.36s)]
*  I am not the Pete Buttigieg of Ukraine. But from what I understand, a lot of the natural, [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2067.28s)]
*  a lot of the minerals that they're talking about is in territories that are either near or directly [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2072.6400000000003s)]
*  in areas that Russia has forcibly annexed and captured. So when he says like, we're going to extract these minerals, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2078.48s)]
*  we're going to take over those minerals. Like, I don't know what he means by that. Is he basically [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2087.28s)]
*  claiming that like they're going to do a joint cooperative extraction agreement, a joint cooperative [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2096.7200000000003s)]
*  extraction agreement with Russia? Is that what he means? I don't really get it. I don't really understand what he's saying. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2102.88s)]
*  Report to show that we have a negotiated peace signed by both sides. And that is a piece we will preserve. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2111.28s)]
*  No, it's all on the Ukrainian side of the river. But there exists basically entirely [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2118.08s)]
*  these would be [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2123.6800000000003s)]
*  deployments. That's why I said like near territory that Russia has annexed, you can't extract minerals [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2125.44s)]
*  in that area. If there are a shit ton of minerals there, I don't think you can extract minerals [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2132.48s)]
*  safely without like Russia's go ahead. If it's in striking distance. That's why I said it's either [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2136.64s)]
*  around the areas that Russia has forcibly annexed and occupied or directly in the areas that Russia [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2142.16s)]
*  has forcibly annexed and occupied, which means that if these hypothetical minerals that are worth [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2147.52s)]
*  trillions exist on Ukrainian soil, which again, I don't know, okay, why did Karl then and not stay? [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2153.44s)]
*  I don't know any of these names chatters. I don't know why you think I'm like picking and choosing [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2159.76s)]
*  favorites in German politics. I just don't know. I'd be down to have that other guy on too. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2165.76s)]
*  Of the burden, their share of strong alliance that we've built over the decades, we have our [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2170.08s)]
*  solidarity and we have deterrence capacities. What does it mean? Would it be dangerous? [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2175.92s)]
*  Yes. If there is an agreement signed by Ukraine and Russia, thanks to the efforts of President Trump, [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2183.44s)]
*  and if we provide the guarantees and Russia violates the agreement, then it would be [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2192.08s)]
*  in conflict with everyone who is engaged in the peace process. And that is a change. That was [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2199.2000000000003s)]
*  something we did not see in the past. That's not what we saw in 2014. So that is the real change [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2204.88s)]
*  that we're marking. We have this deterrence capacity on the American side. We have the [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2211.44s)]
*  capacity for engagement on the European side, and that's something we're going to continue [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2218.48s)]
*  working on together. It's not dangerous, but it's credible. It's less dangerous than things that [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2222.32s)]
*  could happen in the long term. And I think this is what we need to do to ensure security. And I [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2228.7200000000003s)]
*  say this very clearly. We're also talking about security for Europeans. I've been saying this for [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2233.76s)]
*  weeks now. If we do not guarantee the security of this territory within Europe, then how can we [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2239.6s)]
*  guarantee our own security for one and all? We live just 1,500 kilometers from Ukraine, and [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2247.2s)]
*  the Germans and Polish are even closer. So our collective security is important. We need to answer [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2258.88s)]
*  this call for Europeans to be more engaged, and Americans will be there still in solidarity. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2264.96s)]
*  Europeans are working for their collective security, but I really think this was a turning [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2272.0s)]
*  point today in our discussions. Emmanuel, thank you very much. Great job. And it's been wonderful [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2276.16s)]
*  being with you. Say hello to your beautiful wife. And we will see you again soon. We'll be speaking [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2283.2s)]
*  often. We'll get this thing worked out. We're going to get it done. I guess he's not going with [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2288.08s)]
*  Candice Owens' method at all, claiming that Macron's beautiful wife is actually a man. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bQCiA4y3Y&t=2292.24s)]
