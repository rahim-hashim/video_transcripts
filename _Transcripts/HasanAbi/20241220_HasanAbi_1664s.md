*  never ended up responding by the way. Just said left movement in [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=137.8s)]
*  East Europe is mostly post USSR and had no additional feedback [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=140.4s)]
*  at all. I was like, Can you please explain to me what you [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=145.2s)]
*  mean? And he's like, Nah, I actually how about you watch the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=147.33999999999997s)]
*  video? What video? Anyway, let's look at let's look at what the I [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=151.85999999999999s)]
*  don't know what the I don't know what the meat looks like for [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=157.01999999999998s)]
*  this. This new bill. I don't know what they kept out of it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=160.06s)]
*  But I guess it's seemingly the biggest point of contention that [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=165.66s)]
*  was that was cast aside is the is the extension is the January [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=168.5s)]
*  2027 extension for for no debt limit. That one they just took [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=176.8s)]
*  out of it. And I do feel like it's still very much like a [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=184.52s)]
*  Republican move to ask for a lot more and then turn around and [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=188.76s)]
*  dial it back. Ask for 10 things. First, you you go to the table [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=193.68s)]
*  and you extract concessions out of the Democrats. Then when that [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=199.72s)]
*  continued clean continued resolution bill is about to be [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  passed instantly, because there were already concessions that [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=207.6s)]
*  the Democrats had given to the Republicans in the previous [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=211.24s)]
*  continued resolution, they turn around and say at the last [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=213.76000000000002s)]
*  second, no, we shouldn't pass this. And then they say, we want [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=216.76000000000002s)]
*  10 things. Okay, take out like eight, eight funding mechanisms [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=221.44s)]
*  out of the eight funding mechanisms out of the continued [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=227.35999999999999s)]
*  resolution, and then demand one thing that's like insane, right? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=230.8s)]
*  And then they take out the insane thing. And they're still [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=235.16s)]
*  left with the eight other things that they got out of the bill. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=238.4s)]
*  And then the Democrats actually make it seem as though they won [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=243.07999999999998s)]
*  a massive victory here, and are willing to concede. Democrats [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=246.0s)]
*  highlighted casualty of the spending fight funding to combat [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=250.16s)]
*  pediatric cancer, but hey, look, they were graceful in their loss. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=253.6s)]
*  Once again, you notice that they get to they get to drive a big [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=257.96s)]
*  blow to the to the heart of the Republican propaganda machine. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=262.28s)]
*  Here are the six bipartisan policies that were taken out of [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=267.71999999999997s)]
*  the spending bill after Musk torched it. Okay, be that [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=269.96s)]
*  Kabob. Oh, I became in quick with the chicken tendies. Isn't [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=273.26s)]
*  Biden still president? How is Elon Musk involved here? No, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=279.04s)]
*  Elon Musk is the real president. Okay. Make no mistake. Okay, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=281.6s)]
*  here are some of the things that were taken out that the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=286.0s)]
*  Republicans wanted to take out or Elon Musk specifically was [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=288.16s)]
*  advocating to take out of the bill. And this is still [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=291.08000000000004s)]
*  something that Jeff is reporting off of what the AIDS are saying. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=294.6s)]
*  So we don't know the full details yet. My understanding per [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=298.32000000000005s)]
*  AIDS is that these are also out of what's about to be voted on [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=301.24s)]
*  provision aimed at ensuring food stamps are replenished for [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=304.84000000000003s)]
*  Americans whose benefits are stolen probably as many as [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=306.88s)]
*  300,000. Affected a series number two a series of changes [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=308.84s)]
*  the operations of pharmacy benefit managers middlemen in [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=312.56s)]
*  the medicine business that negotiate drug prices with [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=314.56s)]
*  pharmaceutical companies. EG attempted to end spread pricing [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=316.6s)]
*  or PBM charger health plan for more the more for a drug than [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=320.12s)]
*  what they pay to the pharmacies that dispense it. So they they [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=323.24s)]
*  took out the pharmacy benefit managers part of this equation, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=326.98s)]
*  which is ironic because it literally only serves like [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=331.6s)]
*  United healthcare at a pivotal time when everyone seemingly is [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=335.02s)]
*  paying attention to how shitty United healthcare is. Congress [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=338.94s)]
*  acted again on this bipartisan provision, this bipartisan [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=342.62s)]
*  provision because the the for profit healthcare sector is so [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=347.26s)]
*  corrupt and so gross and so bad at making pricing infinitely [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=350.85999999999996s)]
*  worse that even Republicans were like, yeah, we got to deal with [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=357.7s)]
*  this. Okay, so even this otherwise reactive bill was [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=360.66s)]
*  torched. Great stuff. They're fantastic pay hikes for members [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=365.46000000000004s)]
*  of Congress was taken out transferring control of the land [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=369.82000000000005s)]
*  in Washington DC where RFK stadium sits to the district. No [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=372.5s)]
*  new funds here. PBM explained in the best way I already covered [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=376.1s)]
*  it. I watched this video yesterday. Cruz Klobuchar bill [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=379.42s)]
*  aimed at cracking down on revenge is taken out as well. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=383.1s)]
*  Don't know why they did that. That part. That part is truly an [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=385.94000000000005s)]
*  enigma. I can't even talk. I genuinely don't understand why [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=389.98s)]
*  they took the the revenge deep fakes provision out. I don't [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=394.62s)]
*  know. New and expanded restrictions on US investments [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=398.90000000000003s)]
*  in China. That one was for Elon Musk. The bill is now much [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=402.14000000000004s)]
*  shorter about 900 pages or so shorter. It funds the government [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=405.18s)]
*  and provides aids the farmers and natural disaster victims. It [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=409.22s)]
*  does not include a debt ceiling lift. Is it because of Elon and [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=411.70000000000005s)]
*  Grok? Is that why they don't they they have the the deep fake [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=415.1s)]
*  provision taken out? There is that seems so stupid. Like I [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=418.74s)]
*  don't even understand that. I truly don't understand that at [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=423.46000000000004s)]

*  not saying anything because they're on a ad break. Damn it. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=443.02s)]

*  voting against this may have Democrats. If you subscribe, you [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=481.46s)]
*  can also send me you're not doing business as usual. But [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=483.82s)]
*  this is something that they had to come together and pass if [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=486.82s)]
*  they wanted to get it across the finish line and over to the [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=489.3s)]
*  Senate before midnight. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=491.5s)]
*  And it's really difficult to cut. And easy. It's really [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=492.34s)]
*  difficult because everything is a program that somebody cares [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=494.94s)]
*  about. And so you're you're going to have a constituency [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=497.42s)]
*  that is angry for and that they're hearing from [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=500.3s)]
*  constituents and lobbyists about constantly. It will be [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=503.38s)]
*  interesting to see the difference in influence of [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=508.02s)]
*  President-elect Trump once he becomes president and Elon Musk [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=513.3s)]
*  and the Doge caucus and all this and we should note there are [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=516.82s)]
*  Democrats that are part of the Doge caucus. Yes, formally. When [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=519.38s)]
*  we get to March and they want to put through a long term spending [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=523.18s)]
*  bill instead of just this four months. But I appreciate just a [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=527.06s)]
*  little shout out for Hakeem Jeffries. He will see over time [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=532.86s)]
*  if he lives up to Nancy Pelosi is legacy but he keeps very good [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=537.46s)]
*  control of the Democratic caucus and they fall in line with him [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=541.26s)]
*  and he says, No, we're going to go no on this. We want these [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=545.42s)]
*  changes fine. We're gonna go yes on this and everybody lines up [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=548.9s)]
*  with him and and that makes me happy because it's going to be a [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=551.82s)]
*  difficult few years with opportunities to get stuff done [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=554.42s)]
*  with such a slim majority on the Republican side. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=557.94s)]
*  But Charlie, now we get to do this again in March. This is not [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=559.6999999999999s)]
*  the worst it's going to be. It's going to get much worse. But I [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=565.86s)]
*  do think it's interesting and important thing to sort of take a [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=567.98s)]
*  step back and recognize the only principled fight going on anywhere [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=570.6999999999999s)]
*  Jessica Bay Tarlaw in the Republican caucus in the House [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=575.2199999999999s)]
*  and in the Senate, but it's within the Republican caucus and [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=579.14s)]
*  the Democrats are playing as they always do. They're very good [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=581.78s)]
*  at it and I don't necessarily blame them for doing it. But [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=585.1s)]
*  it's all political and they're playing political games. They're [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=587.58s)]
*  playing mind games and a smashing pork fest that is the [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=589.6600000000001s)]
*  only thing that lines them up to get to go along with these [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=595.4200000000001s)]
*  things. And I think that you know, the only interesting [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=598.46s)]
*  argument principled fight going on is among Republicans. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=601.26s)]
*  Well, look, the one thing they're not used to the previous [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=604.98s)]
*  administration didn't remember anything and never held anybody [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=607.0600000000001s)]
*  accountable. I have all the confidence in the world that [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=609.98s)]
*  President Trump won't forget all of this and he will hold people [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=612.58s)]
*  accountable and there will be like I said, this administration [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=615.58s)]
*  didn't fire nobody, there'll be firings, there'll be people who [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=618.74s)]
*  are going to get up out of their seats. So I'm looking forward to [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=620.98s)]
*  it. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=624.5400000000001s)]

*  to the Senate. Of course, we will talk about all of this on [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=634.74s)]

*  came all after a scare over the last several days and then the [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=746.26s)]
*  aftermath of Donald Trump intervening late and scuttling a [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=750.06s)]
*  separate bipartisan deal that had been reached. It appeared to [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=753.5s)]
*  be on a glide path to becoming law. Trump demanding major [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=756.3s)]
*  changes including to include an increase of the national debt [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=759.62s)]
*  limit something you wanted off the table. So we have to come on [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=763.3399999999999s)]
*  CNN, deal with it in the next Congress. That is a damn it [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=766.26s)]

*  And so just larding out the money without doing any kind of [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=784.42s)]
*  conscious pay for us is a mistake. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=788.66s)]

*  House Speaker Mike Johnson, he has a smaller majority next year. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=794.9s)]

*  You're running me. Yeah, so he has eaten the porcupine has been [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=806.34s)]
*  consumed. Now this vote is still open. It should be closed [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=809.3s)]
*  momentarily here and we're waiting for the actual vote [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=812.18s)]
*  count. But this bill will pass the House of Representatives. It [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=814.54s)]
*  is then on to the Senate to sync up perhaps later tonight. The [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=817.6999999999999s)]
*  deadline is midnight. Rich Chad, it looked like this bill got [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=821.62s)]
*  some pretty solid support from Democrats here. Democrats still [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=825.5799999999999s)]
*  control the Senate at least for another few weeks. Do we expect [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=828.62s)]
*  the same results over there in the Senate? Anytime you see a [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=831.5799999999999s)]
*  vote of this caliber that many years, it's probably going to [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=834.78s)]
*  get through the other other chamber here. In fact, it's just [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=838.18s)]
*  a question of time. We wonder how long they will take. But [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=840.78s)]
*  probably you could see a vote of 70 or 80 days on this bill in [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=843.9s)]
*  the Senate later tonight. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=847.38s)]
*  Is this the kind of thing where one senator can hold up the [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=848.5799999999999s)]
*  whole thing and make this go for a few days or this close to the [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=851.62s)]
*  holidays? We don't expect that one of the hundred would do that. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=854.5s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. You could have that happen because again, no [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=858.3399999999999s)]
*  way have to get unanimous consent and agreement. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=861.66s)]
*  Anybody really drag this out and force a government shutdown at [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=867.26s)]
*  that stage. We haven't gotten any signals of that. I've been [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=870.76s)]

*  tell us what they were planning to do. But what happens around [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=876.64s)]
*  this time of year, especially just before the Christmas [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=879.4s)]
*  holidays, as people want to get out of the building and get home [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=881.68s)]
*  and get home and trim the tree and bake the cookies or [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=884.64s)]
*  whatever. So that might kind of give impetus for people to vote [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=886.84s)]
*  for this bill tonight and get home. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=890.3199999999999s)]

*  reaction from you guys. They got it done. It appears. What do you [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=902.2s)]
*  think, Mark? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=905.84s)]
*  Yeah, so there was never the choice right now is you've got a [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=906.88s)]
*  Democratic Senate, as you pointed out a Democratic [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=910.1600000000001s)]
*  president, so that there was never going to be a good bill. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=912.2800000000001s)]
*  So the choice was a bad bill, which is what they had, or a CR [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=914.6800000000001s)]
*  and they've basically chosen the CR with a little bit of a plus [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=918.5200000000001s)]
*  with the disaster rate and the farm bill. So they're trying to [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=921.1600000000001s)]
*  get out of jail for free at this point, this the whole the whole [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=923.7600000000001s)]
*  fight has been pushed aside. As for the Senate, I don't think [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=926.1600000000001s)]
*  anybody is going to I agree with Chad, I don't think [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=928.56s)]
*  anybody's going to stop it. I remember, I used to work for [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=930.5999999999999s)]
*  Senator Jesse Helms, who was used to hold up the Senate knots [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=932.7199999999999s)]
*  in the old days. And one time he's hold up the Senate before [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=935.8399999999999s)]
*  Christmas. And somebody went up to him on the floor and said, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=937.68s)]
*  Jesse, if you don't relent, we're going to be singing Silent [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=939.64s)]
*  Night here in the Senate floor. And he said, Well, if you don't [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=941.64s)]
*  relent, we're going to be singing O Lang Zai. I don't [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=943.4399999999999s)]
*  think that's gonna happen this time. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=945.9599999999999s)]
*  You know, Molly, this is an extreme case of stopgap, right? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=947.4399999999999s)]
*  This hasn't quelled any of the underlying questions that have [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=950.5999999999999s)]
*  been brought up over the last couple of days. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=953.52s)]
*  And I think a lot of Americans are just looking at this and [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=955.6s)]
*  saying Congress doesn't really have that many jobs. They're [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=957.6800000000001s)]
*  supposed to appropriate funds and they're supposed to collect [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=960.88s)]
*  the funds. They've known this was coming all year. The fact [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=963.44s)]
*  that once again, we're at the same precipice where we have to [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=967.12s)]
*  fund the government with hours to go. It shows just how broken [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=970.6s)]
*  Congress is. I think when you look at this, this past [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=973.52s)]
*  election, Americans are saying, we're sick of how we're doing [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=976.0s)]
*  this. You know, we have this massive deficit, we have [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=978.4s)]
*  horrific debt, we have all these problems. And the people in [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=980.84s)]
*  Washington, not only are they not fixing it, they don't even [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=983.88s)]
*  seem capable of fixing it. So I think once everything gets [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=986.56s)]
*  through here, people are going to have much higher standards [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=989.52s)]
*  and much more focus on Congress, which really has played a big [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=992.16s)]
*  role and gotten away with a lot of things and not being held [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=995.96s)]
*  accountable for the mess that the country is in. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=998.4s)]
*  Juan, we're here because Congress didn't pass any of the [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1000.6s)]
*  appropriations. It's like you want to go across the street and [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1003.68s)]
*  say, what is it you say you do here, guys, right? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1005.92s)]
*  Well, I mean, you know, you go back and you think about the [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1009.72s)]
*  fact that we've had Republican majorities and you start [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1012.64s)]
*  looking, looking back to Boehner, you know, come forward [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1014.72s)]
*  to Paul Ryan. And then of course, you come through the [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1017.92s)]
*  recent years and you understand what a difficult situation it [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1020.88s)]
*  has been for Speaker Johnson. He's got a divided caucus and [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1023.88s)]
*  people who don't want to compromise and he's dealing with [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1029.04s)]
*  Donald Trump and apparently Elon Musk sending signals from afar, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1031.68s)]
*  in some cases undercutting him. But so I think that what we've [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1035.84s)]
*  seen today, and what's the clearest signal to me is that the [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1039.28s)]
*  dissension is among the Republicans. Hakeem Jeffries, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1042.84s)]
*  the minority leader in the House, has gotten the Democrats to [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1046.24s)]
*  vote for this bill. But you haven't seen a unified force on [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1049.24s)]
*  the Republican side. And what is that signal going forward? I [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1053.04s)]
*  think I agree with my colleagues tonight in the Senate, people [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1055.44s)]
*  will vote for this and push it forward. But you think about the [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1058.24s)]
*  reason that this remains controversial is because they did [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1061.64s)]
*  not extend the debt limit, right? And what is that about? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1065.36s)]
*  That's about the future of Republican plans to pass an [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1068.52s)]
*  extension of the Trump tax cut of 2017. And if you don't have [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1071.72s)]
*  that extension, then how do you do it? Where's the money coming [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1077.04s)]
*  from? What's the offset? What's the Trump agenda going forward? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1080.3600000000001s)]
*  And will it have the support necessary on the Hill? [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1083.08s)]
*  Well, to this point, I mean, I do think they're going to have [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1085.72s)]
*  to raise the debt limit. That's just something you have to get [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1088.16s)]
*  done. But you look at what's happened in Washington, DC in [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1090.56s)]
*  recent decades. I mean, Mitch McConnell was talking about not [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1093.2s)]
*  shutting down the government when he was elected first time [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1096.0s)]
*  to in DC. I think I think we had 1.8 trillion in debt. And now [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1098.92s)]
*  it's 20 times that. I don't think you do have much [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1103.32s)]
*  disagreement between Republicans and Democrats when it comes to, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1107.2s)]
*  you know, adding all this debt to the to the American taxpayer. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1110.64s)]
*  But people are looking for change and not just, you know, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1114.76s)]
*  party wise, they're just looking for people who will be serious [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1117.12s)]
*  and help the country with some problems. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1119.76s)]
*  One advantage Donald Trump has coming out of this, out of the [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1120.96s)]
*  dissension in the Congress that Molly points out to is that [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1123.84s)]
*  because they didn't pass a budget this year, he's going to get two [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1127.3999999999999s)]
*  reconciliation bills next year. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1130.08s)]
*  Normally, the president gets one budget reconciliation bill [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1131.52s)]
*  because it didn't pass a 20, 25 budget budget bill. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1133.56s)]
*  He gets that reconciliation bill and then he gets another one [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1136.36s)]
*  later in the year. So he has two bites at the apple to do an all [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1138.8799999999999s)]
*  Republican bill on taxes and spending. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1142.24s)]
*  So he could come in because of all that division. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1144.9599999999998s)]
*  He could come in in the first weeks of January and pass a tax [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1148.0s)]
*  cut for eliminating taxes on weight on. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1151.24s)]
*  No, he can't. Eliminating taxes on overtime, social security and all that. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1153.96s)]
*  And just get that done in a few weeks and then come back. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1157.64s)]
*  You guys you want to know what Senate parliamentarian? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1159.88s)]
*  What if the Senate parliamentarian says, no, you can't do that? [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1163.08s)]
*  Oh, oh, over on how fast that person would get fired. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1169.32s)]
*  Literally the moment the moment that they even the Senate [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1173.32s)]
*  parliamentarian even thinks about such things, they would get fired. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1176.08s)]
*  And that's a relief for those people impacted by the hurricanes. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1181.64s)]
*  And it doesn't include extending or raising the debt ceiling, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1186.04s)]
*  which Democrats viewed as an accelerated vehicle to extend the 2017 Trump tax cuts. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1189.4s)]
*  But in the lead up to this moment, the president didn't make any statements. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1196.2s)]
*  He stayed out of public view. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1200.56s)]
*  And the White House framed that as a strategy, even as they had to admit [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1202.36s)]
*  that he hadn't even made contact with Democratic leaders in both chambers [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1206.8s)]
*  until earlier this afternoon, about 12 hours before the shut down deadline loomed. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1211.72s)]
*  Rank and file Democrats were describing a vacuum of leadership talks [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1218.12s)]
*  with half a dozen lawmakers generated this Politico headline, quote, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1222.96s)]
*  Biden is AWOL as Washington spirals into shutdown chaos. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1226.28s)]
*  His absence really gave the GOP a counterpunch. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1229.84s)]
*  By the way, Joe Biden is still the president. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1232.76s)]
*  I said, where is Joe Biden? [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1234.4s)]
*  Has anybody heard from Joe Biden? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1236.1599999999999s)]
*  Again, the picture of a president still in office, but not in charge, was coming [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1237.76s)]
*  together long before Trump and Elon Musk scuttled the government funding plan, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1241.76s)]
*  giving Biden some cover with that. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1245.36s)]
*  Fewer and fewer public appearances lately or even printed statements [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1247.3999999999999s)]
*  lending liberal voices to more loudly question why Biden has been laying low. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1251.0s)]
*  Do you think Biden is quietly quit? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1256.52s)]
*  Trump isn't president yet. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1258.12s)]
*  Uh, a fact that's getting easier and easier to forget. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1260.12s)]
*  That now appears against the backdrop of a damning Wall Street Journal report [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1263.72s)]
*  alleging that White House staff have been working to manage the diminished [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1266.96s)]
*  president for years, restricting his interactions with lawmakers and even [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1270.28s)]
*  cabinet members, keeping meetings short scripted and ideally in the afternoon, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1273.96s)]
*  quote, senior advisors were often put into roles that some administration [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1278.6000000000001s)]
*  officials and lawmakers thought Biden should occupy and the White House denied [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1282.16s)]
*  to the journal that Biden has declined, but allies who first championed his [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1286.6000000000001s)]
*  reelection bid are now on defense. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1290.72s)]
*  I do not hang out with the president on the weekends. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1293.2s)]
*  I don't spend time with him socializing and in person. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1296.2s)]
*  My experience with him in the time up to that debate led me to believe that he [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1299.8400000000001s)]
*  was fully capable of competently leading our nation. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1305.24s)]
*  White House caught a lid around 5 PM, a clear sign that the president was [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1308.76s)]
*  betting that there would be plenty of blame to go around if the government did [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1313.24s)]
*  in fact shut down because Trump had said that this would be a Biden problem to [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1317.56s)]
*  solve. But you had Trump and Elon Musk scuttling a bipartisan plan that the [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1322.6399999999999s)]
*  White House kept speaking up for earlier today. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1327.2s)]

*  his vehicle into a Christmas market in Germany. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1341.0s)]
*  Authorities believe it was intentional and that the vehicle may have been [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1344.0s)]
*  equipped with explosives. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1347.36s)]
*  Correspondent Alex Hogan has the latest tonight from London. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1348.8s)]

*  Hello, Rich. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1353.36s)]
*  So this was a mass casualty event after people were enjoying a Christmas market [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1354.12s)]
*  and a car plowed into them at that event this evening. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1359.6399999999999s)]
*  Two people are dead, including one of them who is believed to be a small child. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1362.76s)]
*  As many as 60 people are wounded, 15 of them facing serious injuries. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1366.8s)]
*  Hospitals near Magdeburg, Germany were quickly put on high alert to prepare for [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1372.08s)]
*  a maximum casualty event. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1377.04s)]
*  German officials tonight warning that the death toll could rise. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1379.1599999999999s)]
*  Law enforcement, firefighters and rescue personnel set up a perimeter on the [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1382.36s)]
*  scene tonight as police cornered off the vehicle over concerns that it could be [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1386.04s)]
*  triggered. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1390.3999999999999s)]
*  Thanks very much for that. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1390.76s)]
*  So we're going to have to cut you off here. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1391.6s)]
*  We have Speaker Johnson now after the votes that succeeded in the House. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1392.6399999999999s)]
*  A big priority for us. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1396.0s)]
*  This is America first legislation because it allows us to be set up to deliver for [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1397.48s)]
*  the American people in January. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1401.8s)]
*  We will make a seat change in Washington. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1403.96s)]
*  President Trump will return to to D.C. and to the White House, and we will have [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1406.52s)]
*  Republican control of the Senate and the House. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1411.56s)]
*  Things are going to be very different around here. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1413.6s)]
*  This was a necessary step to bridge the gap, to put us into that that moment [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1415.6799999999998s)]
*  where we can put our fingerprints on the final decisions on spending for 2025. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1420.3999999999999s)]
*  We also in this bill, as you know, took care of Americans who desperately needed [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1425.56s)]
*  and deserve the assistance. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1429.6399999999999s)]
*  We had a record hurricane season. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1431.04s)]
*  Hurricanes Helene and Milton in particular did dramatic damage across at least six [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1434.0s)]
*  states, the Carolinas, the Virginia, from Florida, Tennessee, all the way through. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1438.0s)]
*  And they had been waiting for the federal government to assist. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1443.1200000000001s)]
*  We did that tonight in this bill. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1446.1200000000001s)]
*  We also took care of our farmers, many of whom were on the brink of collapse [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1447.8s)]
*  because of Bidenomics, frankly, because the inflationary cost of their inputs and [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1451.8s)]
*  the inability they have right now to get loans from the banks and the lenders to [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1457.0800000000002s)]
*  put their crops in the ground, to put the seeds in the ground in the spring. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1462.36s)]
*  So we had to take care of that, and we did. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1465.8799999999999s)]
*  We are excited about this outcome tonight. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1467.96s)]
*  We're grateful that everyone stood together to do the right thing. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1470.9199999999998s)]
*  And having gotten this done now as the last order of business for the year, we [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1474.32s)]
*  are set up for a big and important new start in January. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1477.96s)]
*  We can't wait to get to that point. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1482.24s)]
*  We encourage swift passage in the Senate now. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1484.24s)]
*  They need to do their job as the House just did. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1486.52s)]
*  We will all go home. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1488.76s)]
*  I want to wish everybody a Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, Happy Holidays and [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1489.64s)]
*  a Happy New Year, because I hope not to see you until we get back over there. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1495.2800000000002s)]
*  So we, I was in constant contact with President Trump throughout this process. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1500.44s)]
*  Spoke with him most recently, about 45 minutes ago. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1507.16s)]
*  He knew exactly what we were doing and why. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1510.68s)]
*  And this is a good outcome for the country. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1512.88s)]
*  I think he certainly is happy about this outcome as well. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1515.64s)]
*  Elon Musk and I talked to within about an hour ago. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1518.84s)]
*  And prediction they're going to on accident in the upcoming year, say [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1522.1999999999998s)]
*  President Musk, having the world. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1527.6s)]
*  I think it is, but we're going to get through this. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1529.3999999999999s)]
*  We are going to unify this country and we are going to bring the [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1531.9199999999998s)]
*  America first agenda to the people beginning in January. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1535.6799999999998s)]
*  We cannot wait to get started. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1538.84s)]
*  I hope you all have a great holiday. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1540.1999999999998s)]
*  All right. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1543.9199999999998s)]
*  That's it for House Speaker Mike. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1544.1599999999999s)]
*  A Republican is on accident, completely unintentionally going to slip up and [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1545.52s)]
*  say President Musk, not Democrats. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1554.24s)]
*  Democrats are already saying it to shit on Elon Musk or to shit on Donald Trump. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1556.96s)]
*  Been in constant contact with President Biden. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1563.16s)]
*  I don't think they have been. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1565.28s)]
*  I mean, it's, it's quite remarkable development. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1567.0s)]
*  I mean, Trump is effectively behaving, he's not president yet, but [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1569.6s)]
*  he's effectively the president. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1572.48s)]
*  Joe Biden, you know, they told us that Joe Biden was capable of serving four more years. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1573.88s)]
*  He hasn't been able to serve the two months since the election. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1578.16s)]
*  He fell asleep at a table in Angola. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1581.3200000000002s)]
*  He's left a massive vacuum that Donald Trump has stepped in and filled. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1583.1200000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump has had more of an impact on what's happening on Capitol Hill today [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1586.2800000000002s)]
*  than the sitting president of the United States. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1589.8400000000001s)]
*  It's almost like what you see, what you saw with all the foreign leaders, the [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1592.0800000000002s)]
*  moment Donald Trump was elected, they're all going to Mar-a-Lago treating him as [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1595.0400000000002s)]
*  if he were the actual president. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1598.6000000000001s)]
*  It is kind of crazy right now. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1600.0400000000002s)]
*  I first see a high profile Republican on accident saying President Elon Musk. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1601.52s)]
*  Or President Musk, it driving media narratives for like a week and then [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1606.8799999999999s)]
*  inevitably causing the, the, it will be the final blow of the relationship that [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1611.68s)]
*  Elon Musk and Donald Trump have. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1617.3999999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1619.52s)]
*  That is, I will add that to my yearly predictions. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1620.12s)]
*  I think that the, the dynamic is already on shaky ground. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1622.92s)]
*  You can't have two divas like that side by side. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1626.96s)]
*  It's always going to have, there's always going to be issues, but it's [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1629.76s)]
*  especially, but it's especially bad when it reaches this like peak where, you [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1632.8s)]
*  know, people start Trump starts really getting insecure about his position and [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1640.24s)]
*  how much influence he has. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1644.3999999999999s)]
*  Much more on this after the break. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1646.8799999999999s)]
*  We do have to take a break. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1648.12s)]
*  An awful lot has happened. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1649.44s)]
*  We'll be back with. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1650.44s)]
*  And yeah, no, in this process, all the liberals who have talked about how Biden [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1651.28s)]
*  is a mental dynamo will not be punished. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1655.28s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1657.24s)]
*  They will be rewarded. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1658.0s)]
*  They will have their. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C0lL6-EuU&t=1659.56s)]
