*  I think we could do some along those lines, yeah. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=51.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=58.16s)]

*  Yes. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=77.76s)]
*  No. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=82.24000000000001s)]
*  In f***ing Snowden and E today, that's whack. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=82.74000000000001s)]
*  It's beautiful out here in sunny California, Los Angeles. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=86.72s)]
*  We're on our way to the Bernard Sanders Fight the Oligarchy Tour, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=88.88s)]
*  Fight the Oligarchy Rally, and very excited to link up with some of the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=92.8s)]
*  Hasanabi heads out there today. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=100.16s)]
*  We're going to be focusing on you, the American people. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=101.84s)]
*  We are not able to... [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  We were not able to secure an interview with Bernard or AOC this time around. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=106.96s)]
*  I'm in contact with their teams though. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=111.52s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=114.24s)]
*  I was trying to get something happening with AOC the day prior. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  But it just fell through. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=119.83999999999999s)]
*  We couldn't do it. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=122.64s)]
*  But having said that, today we're going to go [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  and we're going to see what it's all about. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=129.2s)]
*  We're going to see if the Los Angeles... [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=130.88s)]
*  Los Angelinos show out big for the Bernard Valley. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=132.32s)]
*  Apparently, from what I understand, this started at 9 a.m. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=135.51999999999998s)]
*  and people were already slammed. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  They were packing in. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=140.24s)]
*  Really? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=141.92s)]
*  They were packing in at 9 a.m. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=142.56s)]
*  From what I understand, they were already... [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=144.56s)]
*  They already had 15,000 people apparently show up. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=146.96s)]
*  So that's interesting. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=150.88s)]
*  Is that real? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=152.48s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=154.08s)]
*  Yeah, they've been there. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=154.96s)]
*  So I've definitely had some friends text me about it and how they're going. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=156.72s)]
*  Sunscreen my guy, sun, age of skin. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=161.76s)]
*  Sometimes I want to f*** myself out of orbit in a video game when I read stuff like that [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=164.8s)]
*  in the chat where it's like I'm a 33 year old man and you got people micromanaging [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=170.72s)]
*  my skin care habits. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=174.72s)]
*  Oh, and then I wonder why I have a headache. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=176.8s)]
*  It's like this is why I have a headache. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=181.36s)]
*  It's surprising that I wouldn't have a headache at this point. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=185.04s)]
*  Maybe we can get some food around there too after potentially after we leave the rally. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=190.8s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=194.88s)]
*  We'll freestyle the process to the best of our ability here. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=198.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=203.52s)]
*  But I digress. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=204.72s)]
*  Have you had your Saratoga water today? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=211.52s)]
*  So much Saratoga on these guys. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=216.0s)]
*  Bottles and bottles. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=219.84s)]
*  Yeah, it is popping out there. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=223.04s)]
*  The Saratoga water. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=224.96s)]
*  What do you think of Whitmer being in the Oval? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=226.08s)]
*  It's very funny. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=236.16000000000003s)]
*  It's very funny that she was like in her mind she tried to, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=239.76000000000002s)]
*  she made it seem like she like slipped and fell into the Oval Office. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=244.56s)]
*  And was trying to make it seem as though she could just hide herself in the Oval Office [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=247.52s)]
*  after being invited into the Oval Office by Donald Trump. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=259.92s)]
*  You know. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=264.40000000000003s)]
*  What were we doing at 725 AM? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=269.6s)]
*  Why weren't you diving in a pool with no diving sign? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=271.12s)]
*  That's what I was doing. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=273.12s)]
*  That is what I was doing as a matter of fact. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=274.96000000000004s)]
*  I was diving in a pool with no diving sign. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=277.59999999999997s)]
*  Where is this at? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=285.84s)]
*  Is it indoor or outdoor? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=286.96s)]
*  No, it's outdoor. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=288.32s)]
*  That's why I'm not wearing sleeves. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=289.52s)]
*  I see. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=291.2s)]
*  Because the Nevada one was so hot I learned my lesson. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=292.24s)]
*  Oh, that just reminded me of those tacos. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=298.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=303.59999999999997s)]
*  Just outside of that Uber driver. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=304.34000000000003s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=309.14000000000004s)]
*  That was fun. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=310.42s)]
*  Man, those tacos hit the spot there. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=312.34000000000003s)]
*  I was starving that day. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=314.18s)]
*  It was crazy. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=316.26000000000005s)]
*  Do they have any more stops planned on this? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=318.82000000000005s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=321.78000000000003s)]
*  I can ask them. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=323.22s)]
*  I can ask the team. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=324.02000000000004s)]
*  They probably do. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=326.26000000000005s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=327.62s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwFQAMlmXPY&t=382.26000000000005s)]
