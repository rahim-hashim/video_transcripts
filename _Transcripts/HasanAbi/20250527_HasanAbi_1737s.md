# Why Are AOC and Bernie Staying Silent About This? | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo)
*  But like, showing support to someone like Zoran and building a momentum, building a movement, like [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=0.0s)]
*  have having a little bit more courage and having a little bit more confidence in your power is good. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=8.96s)]
*  It's a good thing. I think it's like, not the expectation here is not a crazy one. I don't think [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=16.64s)]
*  it's a crazy thing to expect AOC and Bernie to endorse Zoran, especially when he is clearly [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=24.479999999999997s)]
*  the number one guy. All right. All right. All right. What else was I going to show you? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=31.2s)]
*  There was some other stuff that I was going to look at. Oh, we're going to talk about Zoran. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  We did already talk about Zoran getting endorsed by the liberal king, the liberal God King. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  Hashtag resistance liberalism, his very own right here. Morning New York City. I know getting back [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=54.96s)]
*  on your feet after a long holiday weekend is tough, but here's some news that'll put some [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=60.56s)]
*  pep in your step. Like all campaigns, we hired a research firm to poll New Yorkers. What they [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=64.4s)]
*  just found, it's very exciting. Let's start with the headlines. We're now at 27% in the first round [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=68.72s)]
*  of ranked choice voting, firmly in second place by Andrew Cuomo with the next campaign in single [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=74.24s)]
*  digits. And in the final round, after every other candidate's been eliminated, it's us at 44% and [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=78.64s)]
*  Cuomo at 56%. That's a 12 point gap. In March, it was 40 points. And we've gotten here while a [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=83.84s)]
*  third of New Yorkers still haven't heard of us. That means we're nowhere near our ceiling. That's [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=89.84s)]
*  where you come in. Yes, we're going to have more rallies, more TV ads, more videos like this. And [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  that's all thanks to your contributions. Just this past weekend, our volunteers passed 600,000 doors [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=98.4s)]
*  mounted. No one else is even in the same galaxy, let alone the same neighborhoods. With less than [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=103.68s)]
*  a month to go, we're going to win a city that New Yorkers can actually afford. And San Andrew [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=108.80000000000001s)]
*  Cuomo back to the suburbs. My goat. I think Zoran support is more firm than Cuomo's because his base [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=113.2s)]
*  is more politically engaged. Cuomo doesn't have a base. He's just trailing on name recognition and [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=120.88s)]
*  being a part of the democratic party machine that he designed in the state when he was the governor. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=126.72s)]
*  He comes from a lineage of Cuomo's that have dominated New York politics. His last name is [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=132.24s)]
*  incredibly recognizable and a lot of boomers, okay. Regardless of their background, regardless [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=138.56s)]
*  of demographics, like once they get to a certain age and they hear that, they go, all right, that's [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=145.68s)]
*  a trustworthy name. I know that name. I'll rank it one. That's the problem. Zoran Mumdani, on the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=150.08s)]
*  other hand, is not a name that they know. He needs that fandom endorsement and Jay Schlatt needs to [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=156.4s)]
*  run anti-Cuomo ads if he's a real hater. Yeah, that's what we need to do. We're going to do, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=160.88s)]
*  we're going to fandom tax Andrew Cuomo. It's just, it just sucks. Are AOC and Bernie waiting for [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=166.48s)]
*  the final moments of their endorsement? They have to endorse them, right? I don't know what they're [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=172.0s)]
*  doing, man. I don't know what they're doing. I think AOC, I think one of the biggest problems [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=176.0s)]
*  with the democratic party politicians in this country is that they're so scared. They're so [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=180.95999999999998s)]
*  scared to lead. Okay. And I can't believe I'm saying this for Bernie Sanders, who spent most [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=187.83999999999997s)]
*  of his career being pushed aside as a unique individual with politics that were far too radical [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=195.28s)]
*  for the average American. And then he literally was honest when he ran against the figurehead [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=202.48s)]
*  of establishment politics in 2016. And everyone was like, Oh my God, what a breath of fresh air. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=210.4s)]
*  There is a normal human being who speaks to our desires. And since then, he has just kept going [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=216.72s)]
*  back and taking way more restrained approaches over and over and over and over again. And I don't [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=225.36s)]
*  know why they're just like scared to lead. Ironically enough, you're supposed to keep [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=231.52s)]
*  pushing. You're not supposed to, when you get to a position where your politics becomes more popular, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=236.56s)]
*  okay, in the collective consciousness, when people start going, Oh, yeah, I do actually love that guy, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=243.52s)]
*  you're not supposed to rein it in. You're not supposed to dial it back. You're supposed to [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=250.72s)]
*  keep pushing and push harder, push harder. You know, it doesn't make any sense. And the same goes [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=254.32s)]
*  for AOC as well. I would say AOC was even more radical when she first ran. Like she was way more [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=260.72s)]
*  aggressive with her messaging. And it wasn't a bad thing. It was a good thing. But I think now that [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=266.56s)]
*  she has it's and this is not again, although I do have a direct line of communication with at least [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=270.96s)]
*  people that work in these campaigns and stuff, like I'm not saying this off of like anything I [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=278.96s)]
*  know personally, this is simply my speculation as an outsider, just as just like you, I'm looking [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=283.35999999999996s)]
*  at this from the outside. And I feel like perhaps she is entertaining, unseating Chuck Schumer, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=289.76s)]
*  and she's actually destroying Chuck Schumer, by the way, there's polls that came out that show [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=297.76s)]
*  that AOC is more popular than Chuck Schumer amongst amongst American Jews in New York, okay, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=303.44s)]
*  which is not even remotely surprising if you understand how American politics works. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=313.44s)]
*  But it does kind of cut away at the stupid argument that Chuck Schumer makes all the time, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=318.32s)]
*  which is like, Oh, I'm protecting American Jews. I'm protecting Judaism by protecting Israel. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=323.2s)]
*  Well, it turns out American Jews don't give a about that big dog. What happened? I thought [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=328.56s)]
*  you were the annihilator of anti-Semitism. And that that was the primary function. That was the [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=332.8s)]
*  most important thing. Defending Israel was the most important thing for American Jews, I thought. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=338.0s)]
*  Well, it turns out they don't give a fuck. Why would they? It's so stupid. AOC has like a 10 [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=342.0s)]
*  point lead amongst New York Jews against AOC, against Chuck Schumer, who is Jewish himself. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=347.44s)]
*  He has the highest rank. He is the highest ranking Jewish politician in the country. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=355.28s)]
*  Not the highest platform. Obviously, Bernie is more popular, but yeah, look at this. Look, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=361.68s)]
*  only strategy group poll, New York city, Dem sampled New York, 20, 28 democratic Senate primary AOC at [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=366.32s)]
*  54%. Chuck Schumer at 33% cooked. It's over. New York city, Jewish Democrats sampled AOC at 45% [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=372.16s)]
*  Chuck Schumer at 38%. Chuck Schumer has officially become a less popular figure than even Nancy [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=380.64000000000004s)]
*  Pelosi. Okay. New Yorker comment, New Yorker comment, signing up to canvas right now. Do [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=388.24s)]
*  you know any neighborhoods that need more work since you know, people working on the campaign, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=392.88s)]
*  brother, why are you asking me? Ask the campaign. What? I don't know. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=395.84000000000003s)]
*  That's crazy. You think I'm dialed in on like what areas of need look like for, for Zoran's campaign? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=399.76s)]
*  I don't know. Anyway, look, someone says South Brooklyn. I can't, is for Zoran. Okay. So [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=410.71999999999997s)]
*  I, I, I don't know. Maybe, maybe it's because of stuff like this. Maybe it's because she wants [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=421.12s)]
*  to like unseat Chuck Schumer potentially and become a senator. And that's the reason why [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=425.36s)]
*  she's just like taking a softer approach, but like that's stupid. Okay. I don't think that's smart. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=431.52000000000004s)]
*  I don't think that's a, that's good instincts. Okay. I'm not saying, you know, run around saying, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=439.12s)]
*  you know, to Israel or whatever. Okay. But like showing support to someone like Zoran and building [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=445.36s)]
*  a, a momentum, building a movement, like have having a little bit more courage and having a [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=451.12s)]
*  little bit more confidence in your power is good. It's a good thing. I think it's like not the [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=459.12s)]
*  expectation here is not a crazy one. I don't think it's a crazy thing to expect AOC and Bernie to [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=467.68s)]
*  endorse Zoran, especially when he is clearly the number one guy, especially now with Cuomo [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=474.56s)]
*  getting a DOJ suit slapped on him for, you know, annihilating boomers during COVID, which clearly [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=483.28000000000003s)]
*  is a, which is clearly a political move. And it's identical to what happened with, with Eric Adams. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=491.12s)]
*  It's identical to Eric Adams. Like the Eric Adams situation is that there was a valid [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=500.4s)]
*  investigation from the DOJ under the Brandon leadership. And then when Trump came into office, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=506.08s)]
*  he basically used that existing investigation, dropped the investigation using the DOJ powers [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=511.2s)]
*  that he has to drop the investigation to control Eric Adams better. Okay. It's crazy. They're going [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=517.1999999999999s)]
*  to endorse Ladner because they know he has no chance of winning. Yeah. I'm going to lose my mind [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=524.32s)]
*  if I, if that happens, like no disrespect to that guy either. If Zoran wasn't running and wasn't so [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=531.0400000000001s)]
*  popular, then he's a perfectly valid candidate to back. Okay. He is a progressive. He is, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=537.6s)]
*  he's definitely, I mean, look, he is, he's a progressive. He's nowhere near as, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=546.96s)]
*  as progressive as, as Zoran is. Okay. But having said that Brad Lander is the name that we're [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=553.28s)]
*  talking about. He's the person that actually even head of the congressional progressive caucus, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=560.24s)]
*  Greg Kazar endorsed as well, which I asked him directly why he did that. So Brad Lander is the, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=567.0400000000001s)]
*  is the current New York city comptroller. Okay. And he's not a bad guy by any means. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=573.44s)]
*  Okay. As far as like running for New York mayor, he's not a bad guy by any means. All right. But [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=579.9200000000001s)]
*  right now there is clearly a much more valid opponent to Cuomo. He's not, but not pro-Palestine. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=585.7600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. He's, he's a, he's a lib. He's a liberal Zionist. He's not, I'm saying like adjusted to [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=593.6s)]
*  normal circumstances. If Zoran wasn't running, if Zoran wasn't in the running, you wouldn't even [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=601.28s)]
*  entertain that. You would be like, there's no one on there. Aside from Zoran. That's like a committed [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=608.3199999999999s)]
*  anti-Zionist, which is ironic because people are still saying that Zoran is not a committed anti-Zionist [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=613.36s)]
*  either. Zoran is a committed anti-Zionist in any case. What from the breakfast club interview [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=617.84s)]
*  yesterday? What you want me to watch a 57 minute interview with David Hogg on the breakfast club? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=627.28s)]
*  That's crazy. Didn't he say Israel has a right to defend itself? Who Zoran? No, he did not say that. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=633.52s)]
*  No, they asked him if Israel has a right to exist. And he gave the classic like, yes, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=640.16s)]
*  Israel has a right to exist. No, he didn't say, I don't think he said Israel has a right to defend [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=644.88s)]
*  itself. What the no, he just said Israel has a right to exist, which is again, not the best answer. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=649.68s)]
*  Dude, stop. Why? Why do we always do this? Oh my lord. Oh my lord. Dude, dude, you have to, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=655.76s)]
*  you have to give more allowances to politicians that you know are on your side. Okay. That's it. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=665.04s)]
*  That's it. Because you have to adjust it not to like what the audiences look like, not to what the, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=674.08s)]
*  actual voter base looks like, but instead what the average, like how American politics works. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=680.88s)]
*  Okay. That's it. And as, as time allows, as, as opinions shift, you can be more open about [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=688.24s)]
*  your perspective. If, if time permits, okay. If the environment, like you have to be normal [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=697.04s)]
*  is being signaled by obstacle Zoran support down that tweet went viral with it. I had a few, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=702.64s)]
*  had posts a few days later, a protestor yelling at him and calling and then calling you anti-Semitic. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=707.12s)]
*  Yeah. I know. I know our leaders have to have a commitment to the truth and they have to lead. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=711.84s)]
*  They have to be unafraid of leading. Okay. And a part of that is to sometimes say things that might [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=718.48s)]
*  come across as scary. But as long as you have the courage, as long as you, as long as you say the [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=725.68s)]
*  truth, as long as you have the courage to say the truth, I think, I think you will win more [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=732.96s)]
*  favors than you think. That's it. How is this any different than the lesser evil argument? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=741.2800000000001s)]
*  Because this person is running for office, dude. A lot of people, I think who despise [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=745.84s)]
*  bourgeois elections don't understand they, they, they, on the one hand will despise the duopoly [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=752.08s)]
*  within the bourgeois democratic process that exists in this country. Well, simultaneously [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=759.04s)]
*  expecting fucking politicians that are running in those races to not even remotely try to tailor [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=764.9599999999999s)]
*  their messaging to an audience. Like, I'm sorry, you have to adjust your expectations to the, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=772.24s)]
*  the average. Okay. The average, what is the average position? I said this back then when [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=780.4s)]
*  his response was, you know, that Israel is a right to exist, I said like the correct response [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=785.76s)]
*  to this. And I think someone like Zoran should, you know, someone like Zoran should have a better [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=791.04s)]
*  response for this, obviously, considering, you know, where we are at this point, it was like [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=796.88s)]
*  19 months into this genocide. Having said that, however, having said that, however, okay, you know, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=802.08s)]
*  he's a Muslim dude running for mayor of New York. Like, what are we fucking talking about? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=809.12s)]
*  It's the, it's not everyone has the same allowances. Brad Lander, okay, who is Jewish, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=814.64s)]
*  could literally scream from the mountaintops that the Zionist entity must be dismantled piece by [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=821.44s)]
*  piece, if he wanted to. Bernie Sanders could say the same, straight up. Okay, I'm gonna be honest [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=826.96s)]
*  with you. This is an allowance that American Jews have that a fucking Muslim doesn't. Wake up. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=835.0400000000001s)]
*  Okay, Jesus Christ. Some of y'all act like we don't live in the fucking real world, you know, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=842.88s)]
*  politicians already have a, a different set of standards, but it's crazy. No, you can say, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=848.48s)]
*  listen, listen, if an American Jewish person says something like that, and then all of the like [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=857.12s)]
*  Israel advocacy groups turn around and go, Oh, this Jew is a Jew hater or whatever, right? He's [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=863.84s)]
*  anti-Semitic. No American is going to comprehend that Americans are not smart enough to even [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=868.8s)]
*  understand that there can be anti-Semitic Jews like Stephen Miller, for example. Okay. They don't, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=876.3199999999999s)]
*  they don't understand that. So it's like using that stupidity to your advantage. Do you understand [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=882.16s)]
*  me? Do you get what I'm saying? Like Americans don't look at that and go, Hmm, a token Jew, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=888.24s)]
*  I guess. Like they don't think about it like that. That's why Candace almost gets so much [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=895.52s)]
*  fucking play being a black woman who says the most white supremacist shit. Do you understand me? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=898.64s)]
*  Her entire job is to be that person, to put a black face on white supremacist statements. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=904.72s)]
*  My opinion on it at the time, my statement on it at the time was like, look, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=910.96s)]
*  the real answer to this is that no state has a right to exist. This is no different than saying, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=915.68s)]
*  does Nazi Germany have a right to exist or does apartheid South Africa have a right to exist? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=923.0400000000001s)]
*  You know, does, does Rhodesia have a right to exist? No, no state has a right to exist. People [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=929.0400000000001s)]
*  have a right to exist. Israel already exists as a state. Okay. And no, Israel in its current [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=934.64s)]
*  formation as a genocidal apartheid state does not have a right to exist. It's a criminal enterprise. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=941.76s)]
*  But I think in that moment, someone like Zoran as a, as a visible Muslim brown socialist guy [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=946.64s)]
*  is making a calculation, a different calculation than someone like yourself or someone like myself. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=952.9599999999999s)]
*  I am much more forgiving of people toning down their rhetoric, especially if they're running for [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=959.04s)]
*  office. That's my point. I said, no state has a right to exist. People have a right to exist. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=965.1999999999999s)]
*  Nazi Germany had no right to exist. Neither the Rhodesia, Israel's an apartheid state doing a [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=969.28s)]
*  genocide has no right to exist in its current formation. Wait, what the fuck? I actually [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=973.12s)]
*  replied to my own tweet, but where is it now? Do China and Russia? He's definitely paid. I actually [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=977.36s)]
*  replied to this post, but I can't even find it. But Twitter is so broken that it's like, you can't [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=983.2s)]
*  even see anything correctly. I always defer to the Muhammad L curd tweet on this. Yeah. Here. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=986.96s)]
*  He said, just in case you didn't know Israel has a right to exist as a racist, anti-Palestinian [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=995.44s)]
*  dog whistle, which implies the extermination of the Palestinian people. It was crafted and popularized, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=999.36s)]
*  but the Israeli ministry of foreign affairs and repeating it verbatim today as a genocide is waged [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1002.72s)]
*  is especially egregious and akin to saying Nazi Germany had a right to exist while it was carrying [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1006.72s)]
*  out the Holocaust. I cannot for the life of me figure out why any self-respecting Palestinian or [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1010.64s)]
*  Arab will slide without question, even if, and particularly when it is from an ally, we have to [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1014.4s)]
*  put our support behind and trust in and no, I am not allergic to power. I'm allergic to indignity, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1019.36s)]
*  though I thought it's implied. Let me clarify. I do hope Zoran wins the mayoral race because [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1023.76s)]
*  that's in the best interest of the working class New Yorkers. Also no progressive politicians should [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1028.08s)]
*  be repeating Zionist talking points to 20, 25, two things can be true. Critique does not equal [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1031.04s)]
*  cancellation. Yeah. I said, Oh, this was my response to my own tweet. I said, also, I like [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1034.8799999999999s)]
*  Zoran a lot. I don't think anyone has to play these games anymore, but maybe the boomer elector [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1039.36s)]
*  of New York city is not equipped to hear that from a Muslim mayoral candidate. You know, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1042.8799999999999s)]
*  it's insidiously vague because saying it has no right to exist is implied to mean that you want [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1046.6399999999999s)]
*  to end all the people that currently live there, which obviously has no nuance whatsoever. Exactly. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1050.96s)]
*  Anyway, yeah, Mike from PA had a good take on this. Yes, exactly. When he was on no [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1055.04s)]
*  extreme the other day, I saw it as well. You can't expect people running for major office to say the [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1061.2s)]
*  right thing all the time. It's better to know if they're a sympathizer versus an opportunist. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1065.52s)]
*  And Zoran is very much a sympathizer. Exactly. There are two different types of politicians. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1069.04s)]
*  You have sympathizers and you have phonies. Okay. Opportunists opportunists are people like [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1072.8799999999999s)]
*  Federman. Federman is an opportunist. Okay. An opportunist adorns the or adopts the aesthetics of [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1079.2s)]
*  like revolutionary politics or socialist politics or says that they actually care, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1087.3600000000001s)]
*  but they actually don't care. And then you have sympathizers who the expectation is that they [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1092.0800000000002s)]
*  will moderate their tone when running for office. Okay. Richie Torres is an opportunist. Kirsten [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1097.0400000000002s)]
*  Sinema was an opportunist. Cory Booker used to be an opportunist back in the day. He doesn't even [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1103.76s)]
*  do that anymore. Obama opportunist. Most politicians are opportunists. And then you have [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1107.76s)]
*  the unique politician that is a committed person. Okay. I think Zoran is committed. He is, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1114.0s)]
*  I guess, a sympathizer if you want to call it that. Anyway, let's move on. I don't know why [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1123.04s)]
*  we're re-litigating this. Every time I bring this shit up. Look, now look, I'm as big as an AOC [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1128.16s)]
*  defender as they come, but it is worrying that there has not been even a mention of this campaign [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1132.56s)]
*  by her and Bernie and even more problematic that our office is a black box where we don't know what [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1136.4s)]
*  the fuck's going on. However, the QDs of the Old Room and Zoran endorsement aren't happy people. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1140.24s)]
*  They are complaining about AOC. A lot of you aren't even into socialism, progressivism, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1145.52s)]
*  or whatever the richest field for negative complainants you were naturally drawn to. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1148.96s)]
*  Listen, we need more party discipline and are refusing to endorse in her city is just insane. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1152.88s)]
*  I say this as someone who isn't as an AOC obsessive. Is she refusing? I don't know that. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1157.8400000000001s)]
*  I think she's doing it on the same schedule. She does any citywide endorsement for someone [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1161.92s)]
*  who is maxed out. The problem is Zoran is not maxed out. That's precisely the reason why she [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1166.64s)]
*  should be actually fucking endorsing him. And she has made other citywide endorsements already. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1171.44s)]
*  Oh, he means fundraising. Oh, okay. Well, there are other, okay. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1177.28s)]
*  my bad. I misunderstood. I misunderstood. Zoran is maxed out on fundraising. That's correct. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1184.72s)]
*  Okay. Having said that, however, having said that, no, no, no, no, no, there's something much more [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1189.0400000000002s)]
*  important than fucking fundraising. That is name recognition is not Zoran is maxed out on the [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1194.0800000000002s)]
*  fundraising, but he is not maxed out on the name recognition. AOC is a nationally recognized, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1201.3600000000001s)]
*  very popular New York politician. Okay. Her word at this stage would be incredible. Okay. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1207.1200000000001s)]
*  The most impact, the maximum impact that you could have to potentially even swing this fucking [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1217.3600000000001s)]
*  election in Zoran's favor would be to hold a goddamn New York rally, one of those like fight [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1222.72s)]
*  the oligarchy rallies, and then endorse Zoran and have Zoran speak at that New York rally. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1228.96s)]
*  If there was a Bernie AOC rally in New York, and then they endorse Zoran, and they had Zoran [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1234.0s)]
*  fucking speak, oh my Lord, the AOC number one endorsement would absolutely close this gap. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1239.3600000000001s)]
*  And unlike Wiley last time who went from underwater to almost winning Zoran already has run by far the [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1244.48s)]
*  strongest campaign and will be able to do much more to maximize impact with voters. Conversely, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1249.2800000000002s)]
*  a non number one endorsement will ensure the press focuses mainly on the fact that it wasn't a number [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1254.4s)]
*  one endorsement saying like rank Zoran is number one. That is the word. Those are the words that [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1258.4s)]
*  need to come out of AOC and Bernie Sanders' mouth, but especially AOC. I hate these fucking dipshits, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1264.0s)]
*  by the way. This guy is like a massive fucking Israel dick rider. I see him constantly. I hate [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1269.52s)]
*  these goddamn liberals. Mum Donnie would make a bad mayor in the Brandon Johnson mold. If she [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1275.36s)]
*  endorses and he loses, she has the stink of his loss on her. If she endorses and he wins, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1279.44s)]
*  she's tainted by association to his inevitably terrible tenure as mayor. I hate these guys, man. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1283.28s)]
*  These guys just want to fucking lose, you know? Or not they want to lose. They just don't want [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1289.6s)]
*  the left to win. I know she met in person with Lander and Mum Donnie. I know a while back, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1293.76s)]
*  like a couple weeks ago, AOC meetings with Lander and Mum Donnie spurred talk of possible mayoral [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1301.76s)]
*  endorsement. And considering the Congressional Progressive Caucus leader, Greg Kazar, early on [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1306.0s)]
*  endorsed Brad Lander, while simultaneously saying Zoran would be great, but like endorse Brad Lander, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1310.8s)]
*  I am worried that AOC is going to do some fuck shit like this, which is it's like it's loser shit. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1317.2s)]
*  Okay. It is their shit. We don't ride the polar coaster, but oh my God, first round 27, last [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1324.24s)]
*  round 44%. And most importantly for organizers, that's with 33% not knowing who Zoran Mum Donnie [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1329.1200000000001s)]
*  is. The ceiling is so high. Oh, and this is the other side of the Zoran conversation. All of these [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1334.96s)]
*  yimbies, Zoran, much like many progressive figureheads, has a yimby sympathetic campaign. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1341.12s)]
*  He is Mr. D-Zoning. Okay. He is an advocate for more, for building more housing. That is a [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1350.8s)]
*  pivotal part of his campaign promises. And yet, all of these abundance aligned, you know, political [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1359.04s)]
*  commentators are anti-Zoran. So much so that they are quite literally saying they might even endorse [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1367.76s)]
*  fucking Eric Adams. Once again, this kind of stuff is quite literally a perfect demonstration that [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1375.92s)]
*  these guys and their position is just anti-left. That's it. They're just anti-left charlatans. And [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1383.84s)]
*  that's the only thing they care about. Honestly, might pick Adams and I do not like Adams much at [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1392.16s)]

*  do you want more building in the most basic ways to explain it in the most reductive terms? [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1480.0s)]

*  I'm at on the New York city race more broadly says Matthew Iglesias. It's not just that one guy from [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1550.24s)]
*  the center for new liberalism is this guy speaking at the welcome pack conference to given a choice [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1554.1599999999999s)]

*  They pick a bribe taken Trump extorted puppet mayor. Here's where I'm at on the New York city [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1563.28s)]
*  mayor more broadly says Matthew Iglesias egg boy himself. Polling right now suggests the final [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1567.6s)]
*  round of RCV in the New York city mayoral election will come down to Andrew Cuomo or Zora Mondani, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1573.52s)]
*  two deeply flawed options for abundance focused moderates. After ranking better top line options [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1577.12s)]
*  like Zell nor Myrie, who would you rank fifth between Cuomo and Mondani to ensure your vote has [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1582.8s)]
*  meaning in the final round among the top two. I think Cuomo is a bad choice. And Mom, Donnie is a [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1587.12s)]
*  disastrous choice. I would support Eric Adams in the general election. But he thinks Mom, Donnie is [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1591.52s)]
*  worse than Andrew Cuomo egg boy, we Republican in eight years or less. He already is man. He already [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWgEYauwmqo&t=1597.76s)]
