**HasanAbi:** [January 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJB01si39Yc)
*  Who is we? We man, we America, Americans. Yeah, I'm not speaking French. I'm saying we bro. This is us. Look, look in the mirror. And by when I say we when Europeans go we we that's just a you thing. Make no mistake, you have your own version of this. When America gets [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJB01si39Yc&t=0.0s)]
*  a this morning president-elect Trump is said to have breakfast with GOP centers before bro. What is there any chance that Dems have any plan to mount real opposition to the Trump and Reich? No, so far it's been looking real bad. Oh, yeah. This is from that same Knesset meeting where he said some unhinged ass shit. He said we've got to start. He said that the pager terrorist attack in Lebanon was a genius act combating [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJB01si39Yc&t=20.24s)]
*  anti-Semitism and we need to see more of it or something. Doing things differently. And the same goes here in Israel. This means that the problem won't be solved by yet another new Knesset task force. It won't be solved by the government just throwing money at the problem. It won't be solved by the IDF spokesperson's unit issuing updated talking points or suddenly using tick tock. Like us in America, you need to adopt new strategies to experiment with creative tactics to study the results and [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJB01si39Yc&t=50.2s)]
*  scale what works. Maybe it's a whole new idea if you need call it 8300 to lead this fight, but we need the kind of genius that manufactured Apollo gold pagers and infiltrated has Bala for over a decade to prepare for this battle. We need the kind of courage that executed operation deep layer inside Syria and destroyed Iranian missile manufacturing capabilities to undertake this mission. This is the kind of ingenuity and inventiveness that have always been a hallmark of the state of Israel. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJB01si39Yc&t=80.2s)]
*  That have always been a characteristic of the Jewish people. I know we can do it. Civil rights leader, by the way, an American civil rights leader is wild, ma'am. All right, Trump. Dana White. Liberalism is dead. This is true. The problem is what's taking its place is not socialism or anything. It's it's what's taking his place is just fatism. Liberalism is completely done. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJB01si39Yc&t=110.2s)]
*  The rise of the ultra right in the U.S. ultra right. No, this is we're so cooked for visiting Arlington Cemetery for the changing of the guard and the laying of the wreath. He then heads to the Capital One arena to speak at a MAGA victory rally where we are expecting thousands of supporters. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJB01si39Yc&t=137.16s)]
*  Griff Jenkins is outside of said arena and joins us right now. And Griff, because they canceled the parade and all those people behind you, we're going to be at the parade tomorrow, but there is no parade. So they want to be able to see the president. And that's why some of them started standing in line a couple days ago. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJB01si39Yc&t=157.12s)]
*  That's right. Good morning, Steve. And this crowd is growing here. The weather's not even bad. You can see they are ready for that MAGA victory rally. President-elect Trump's going to speak. Vance is going to speak. Elon's going to speak. They're going to hear from all sorts of musical acts. Kid Rock, the village people, Billy Ray Cyrus. But let's start talking to people here. What's your name? Where are you from? I'm from New York. And why did you come and are you ready for this rally? I'm absolutely ready. I went to the MSG rally, but I'm going to tell you something. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJB01si39Yc&t=178.08s)]
*  I came to America 47 years ago yesterday, and now I'm here today to witness, well, tomorrow, the 47th president. You can't make that up. What does this mean to you? It means a lot to me because my great grandfather was a miner. Okay. And then he had my grandmother was born in West Virginia. So then my father came here with my brother. They worked hard and they brought all of us back to America. And we came here for the better tomorrow. The American opportunity, the land of opportunity. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJB01si39Yc&t=208.08s)]
*  That's what we came for. And you got a tattoo going here too. Where are you from? I'm from Scranton, Pennsylvania. Why are you here? I'm here for the 47. We made it. We worked really hard to get here to the people put a mandate, right? So I'm just so proud. And I just, I want to see, you know, Trump and make it official. Did you get that tattoo because of Pete Hegseth? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJB01si39Yc&t=238.08s)]
*  Well, Pete Hegseth. Yeah, you're right. But look at, I have the 45 right here and I'm going to put the 47 somewhere. All right here. Great. Come with me for a second guys. You can see literally this line. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJB01si39Yc&t=265.04s)]
*  Dude, we are, we are, we are a, we're just unwell. We are not well, dude. The level of unrestricted, unlimited, unfettered mental illness is out of control. Okay. Oh my God. Who is we? We man. We America. Americans. Yeah, I'm not speaking French. I'm saying we bro. This is us. Look, look in the mirror. And by when I say we, when Europeans go we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJB01si39Yc&t=280.16s)]
*  we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we we're we are. We bring in our blend. We bring in our blend in our blend. We're about to fall apart, peeing, strokes of his and his are about to always be stuck next to us. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJB01si39Yc&t=310.16s)]
