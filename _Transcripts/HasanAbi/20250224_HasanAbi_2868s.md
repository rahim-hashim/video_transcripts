# Crimes Exposed As Israel Releases Palestinian Prisoners | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw)
*  How come the anger in Israel doesn't cause more pressure on Netanyahu? It has so far. That's why [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=0.0s)]
*  he had to do two ceasefire negotiations, but that's only a small part of the pressure. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=5.2s)]
*  It's not enough. The pressure is clearly not enough. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=10.88s)]
*  None of these countries are the none of these countries actually care about popular mobilization [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=14.8s)]
*  until that popular mobilization turns into a literal rebellion. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=20.0s)]
*  America included is a part of the failure of this tactic though, that the rest of the world has been [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=24.96s)]
*  watching an Israel cementing itself as a pariah state, regardless of what's being said in Israel [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=28.96s)]
*  proper. Actually turning to the middle East to ceasefire in Gaza is at risk. Hamas released [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=32.88s)]
*  six more Israeli hostages. Wow. That's crazy. Is there a risk? I wonder who's spoiling it. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=43.92s)]
*  I wonder who's spoiling the second stage of the negotiations. Hmm. Hmm. Weekend, but Israel then [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=49.68s)]
*  refused to release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners accusing Hamas of using those hostages [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=57.76s)]
*  for propaganda. In the meantime, Israel's army has stepped up its military operations in the West Bank. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=63.36s)]
*  Deborah Pata has more on that. I wish, I wish Israel when releasing their hostages would use [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=69.44s)]
*  their conditions as propaganda, not because they currently do, but their propaganda is one of [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=77.92s)]
*  domination. They show they didn't hostages that they release as like, you know, in horrible [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=83.68s)]
*  conditions, losing arms, legs, clearly tortured. That's the propaganda. It's a propaganda of [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  domination. Okay. When they say Palestinians Hamas and Islamic Jihad, when they release Israeli [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=95.52000000000001s)]
*  hostages, they're doing propaganda. It's like, yeah, dude, no shit. Except their propaganda is [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=101.68s)]
*  look in spite of everything you've done, look at the conditions that we're releasing your hostages. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=107.76s)]
*  Look at the dignity that we've offered to your hostages and the conditions that we release them, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=112.8s)]
*  as opposed to how you release our hostages. Okay. Israel constantly complains about propaganda when [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=116.39999999999999s)]
*  their immediate solution to that would quite literally be to not do Israel shit. Don't [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  re-s**t the Palestinian prisoners to death. That's a good starting position, I think. You know, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=129.2s)]
*  can't believe I'm saying this. The Israeli prison service just as Palestinian prisoners in clothes, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=133.92s)]
*  bearing the Star Davis symbol in the phrase, we do not forget and we do not forgive. Yeah. They see [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=137.51999999999998s)]
*  the Israeli hostages being released with like keffiyehs and they go, okay, it's time. It's time [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=143.12s)]
*  to really show you what's what. Like do the same thing. Do the same thing. Release them [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=147.92s)]
*  in good condition. Why can't you do that? Is that too hard? On the other hand, those m*****s are [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  getting bombed every day. They don't have food. They're getting bombed every day. And in spite of [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=159.6s)]
*  all, in spite of all of that, they still try to show like, Hey, what you're saying is incorrect. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  We're undermining the propaganda that you've, you've, you've said about the, the Hamas movement [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=170.32s)]
*  or the Palestinian movement as a whole. The problem though, and we talked about this quite a bit. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=178.79999999999998s)]
*  The problem here is, yeah, here it is. Prisoner Mohammed Abu Tawila released from Israeli jails. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=184.88s)]
*  Israel's angry with the hostage ceremonies in Gaza. Meanwhile, they're doing this to the Palestinians. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=189.84s)]
*  And the, the thing is the existence of Palestinians is already offensive. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=193.84s)]
*  The fact that Palestinians exist and also fight back against Israel is unimaginably offensive. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=200.88s)]
*  It is humiliating. If your entire nation state project revolves around saying these are subhuman [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=208.32s)]
*  that must be forcibly excised from these lands that we must take, that is our land, then yeah, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=215.6s)]
*  virtually every reminder that they exist or even dare to fight back is going to be infinitely [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=223.35999999999999s)]
*  humiliating. This is precisely the reason why you're being a bit friendly towards Hamas. Let's not [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=229.84s)]
*  forget there at this organization. Yeah. Okay, dude. Sure. Jesus Christ. Like how are you openly [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=235.44s)]
*  recognizing that this is a thought terminating cycle here? Like you're engaging in it. You're, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=243.12s)]
*  you're literally openly stating it. You know that, right? The real truth teller, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=249.04s)]
*  you're being a bit friendly to towards the mosque. Why? Because I'm saying that like they have, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=252.95999999999998s)]
*  not because of morality, I'm not making the argument that like Hamas is, is, is trying to [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=257.28s)]
*  keep the hostages to the best of their ability and the best conditions possible, even though those [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=262.48s)]
*  conditions are still horrifying because they're in Gaza. Okay. And it's not because out of the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=266.4s)]
*  kindness of their hearts is because that's their leverage is their bargaining chip. When I say that, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=272.88s)]
*  which is a correct fact, it's just the objective analysis. You think that is being too friendly to [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=277.68s)]
*  Hamas. This is so stupid. It's ridiculous. You, you literally, when you say that, you're like, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=283.76s)]
*  no, I want you to say that they're barbaric rapist monsters, please. It's crazy. And you're also [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=288.88s)]
*  saying that while you're watching a, an out and about organization by the name of the Israeli [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  state and its immediate consequences on Palestinians and how they have mistreated Palestinians. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=299.52s)]
*  Like that is, that is on the backdrop here. And you're like, well, you're being quite friendly to [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=304.96s)]
*  the first who's the real here. It's insane. Oh, that's what's so frustrating about this is that [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=309.12s)]
*  people don't want to recognize that, you know, previous things that they've been socially [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=315.2s)]
*  conditioned into believing might not be true. So instead of like re-examining their relationship, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=320.79999999999995s)]
*  they just double down and go, no, the other side that's telling me must be wrong. There must be [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=326.4s)]
*  some cynical reason. What is that cynical reason? He's secretly anti-Semitic. That's what this must be. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=333.52s)]
*  Okay. You can't imagine a world. No, I'm saying it's damaging to be as friendly to Hamas as [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=340.4s)]
*  as you are being. It can be misinterpreted. I don't give a fuck, dude. Oh man. It can be [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=346.96s)]
*  misinterpreted. It already is. People purposely weaponize any kind of sentiment that you have [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=351.67999999999995s)]
*  that's pro-Palestinian as, as being friendly to those organizations. Like any kind of anti-Israeli [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=356.88s)]
*  sentiment as anti-Semitism. I don't give a shit. I know the irony of course, is that these people [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=362.64s)]
*  get away with lying. These people get away with saying whatever the fuck they want about Israel [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=370.08s)]
*  because Israel is America's ally. And there are plenty. There's plenty of mainstream outlets that [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=374.8s)]
*  will openly do this propaganda. Yeah. Seven cops to be charged for allegedly branding the Palestinian [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=381.36s)]
*  with star of David. I'm good on that, man. If you don't want Hamas to exist, if you have an issue, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=386.96s)]
*  if you have an issue with Hamas, okay. In, in its tactics or in its form of governance, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=393.03999999999996s)]
*  its domestic affairs. And if you want Hamas to perish, the easiest solution there is to stop [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=399.2s)]
*  Israel from occupying Palestinians and dominating their lives is to end and abolish the apartheid. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=404.08s)]
*  Okay. That's it. That's it. And it's so shocking that people just refuse to reckon with that. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=410.56s)]
*  And it's gross when it's also gross people who are ashamed because they understand that they're [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=417.2s)]
*  progressive enough or are in like progressive circles or have a somewhat progressive audience. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=425.68s)]
*  They're so ashamed of openly defending Israel that they have to turn around and be like, no, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=430.88s)]
*  I'm actually pro-Palestinian, but you know what? I'm the only correct pro-Palestinian. Everyone else [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=436.88s)]
*  is actually wrong in their defense of Palestinians. They're doing it wrong. Listen to me, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=442.96s)]
*  a guy who spends all of his time shitting on everyone that is an advocate for the Palestinian [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=447.91999999999996s)]
*  cause. Okay. Come on, come on, dude. Are you that stupid? The out of here. I'm sorry, but if you're [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=454.08s)]
*  that easily duped, then yeah, you're gonna, you're going to find yourself believing anything. Okay. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=462.64s)]
*  They either do that or pick the no sides of right approach. I know it's like you're looking at a [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=469.12s)]
*  big dog there. What do you mean? No sides are right. No, we don't know anyone like that. Oh, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=473.44s)]
*  I know someone like that. I know someone like that. And you all know someone like that too. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=478.71999999999997s)]
*  There's a lot of people like that though. Part of the story. Good morning. Israeli tanks have moved [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=484.32s)]
*  into the occupied West bank for the first time in over two decades. What is the operation comes [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=491.28s)]
*  amidst fears that the fragile Gaza ceasefire said to expire by the end of the week will not be [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=497.35999999999996s)]
*  extended. The last living. I love you bro, but you complain like a diva. What do you mean? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=503.35999999999996s)]
*  What is the complaint? Like, are you having a hard time understanding? Do you think the [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=509.2s)]
*  complaint is valid or not? XX destiny too? No, this is not a sex pest in the simp. It's worse. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=513.28s)]
*  It's a person who loves playing destiny too. I love you bro, but I hate when you complain that [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=519.68s)]
*  people try to present themselves as pro-Palestinian and simply engage in the [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=526.24s)]
*  most ridiculous Hasbra pro-Israel expressions you've ever heard of. Yeah. All right. I guess [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=533.28s)]
*  I'm a diva then. Israeli hostages to be freed as part of the six week truce were reunited. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=539.28s)]
*  I should stop being a diva. And by that, I mean threatened to docs, people that work at Reddit [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=546.32s)]
*  threatened the docs, random anonymous Reddit users. Okay. With frivolous defamation lawsuits [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=551.84s)]
*  with the express purpose of trying to get their private information so I can get my psychopathic [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=558.72s)]
*  audience to go around and smear random people as anti-Semites. Because, you know, if you, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=565.0400000000001s)]
*  if you criticize me correctly, because you assessed the things that I'm saying and it comes across [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=571.6800000000001s)]
*  like I'm attacking all of the pro-Palestinian groups, maybe even calling Jewish voice for [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=577.84s)]
*  peace, Kapos, for example. Okay. Which is, you know, pretty good indication that you might, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=582.08s)]
*  you might not necessarily be on the side of the Palestinians here. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=588.0s)]
*  And when people call you a Zion as you turn around and you're like, well, that's defamation. That's [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=593.2800000000001s)]
*  anti-Semitism. Okay. Well, you know, good luck. That's the, that's the non-diva position [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=597.12s)]
*  over the weekend, but in Gaza, families waited in vain after Israel said it had delayed the release [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=605.44s)]
*  of more than 600 Palestinian prisoners until Hamas stops what it calls its humiliating hostage [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=613.6800000000001s)]
*  handovers. Hamas now says it will not engage in any further negotiations until the prisoners are [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=620.96s)]
*  handed over. Families of captives still in Gaza are insisting talks must continue. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=628.0s)]
*  And Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu was heckled during a military graduation on Sunday [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=635.68s)]
*  accused of abandoning Sheree Bibas and her two boys after their bodies were finally brought home [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=642.4799999999999s)]
*  for burial. US special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, arrives in the region later this [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=649.1999999999999s)]
*  week in a bid to ensure the ceasefire holds for a second phase. Vlad. Deborah Paddanis Jerusalem. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=655.52s)]
*  Thank you very much. Yeah. Interestingly enough, not only are they intentionally sabotaging Israel [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=662.96s)]
*  is not only intentionally sabotaging this ceasefire deal as predicted as was always going to happen, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=670.48s)]
*  of course, but they're also what Hassan, did you know that you're in desperate need of therapy [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=676.0s)]
*  and intervention from your friends, QD Ludwig Austin and will someone on the internet told me [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=680.48s)]
*  that? Yeah, definitely. I'm the one who needs therapy. Um, yeah, while they're doing that, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=683.84s)]
*  they're also moving aggressively of completely. Gaza, flying the West Bank. Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=690.32s)]
*  Netanyahu is warning the army is on standby to restart its war on Gaza. It comes a day after [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=699.52s)]
*  Israel suspended the latest release of Palestinian prisoners as part of January ceasefire deal. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=705.76s)]
*  I know we are prepared to resume intense fighting at any moment. Our operational plans are ready. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=710.88s)]
*  Let me state our core policies in Gaza. We have eliminated most of Hamas's organized forces, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=720.8s)]
*  but let there be no doubt we will complete the war's objectives entirely, including this one. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=726.08s)]
*  This can be achieved either through negotiation or by other means. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=732.88s)]
*  But let's bring in Massim Naim, a member of Hamas's political bureau. Many thanks for being with us. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=736.24s)]
*  What is Hamas's response to Israel withholding the release of 620 Palestinian prisoners? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=743.2s)]
*  Thank you very much. And let me start with the condemnation of all words [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=752.88s)]
*  the two Israeli offensive in the northern part of the West Bank and unfortunately the silence of [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=759.76s)]
*  the international community towards what's happening there. The continuous killing and destruction [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=767.12s)]
*  against our refugees in the in the different refugee camps in the north. I think we have [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=773.52s)]
*  signed an agreement on January 19th and this agreement to this deal signed from both parties [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=781.2800000000001s)]
*  and with the guarantees of the mediators, the Qataris, the Egyptians and the Americans. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=789.44s)]
*  We have fulfilled all our obligations according to the Am I crazy? But why was there such a mess [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=796.4000000000001s)]
*  on the ceasefire when he's saying on TV, they're going to attack right away. Does he think no one [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=803.9200000000001s)]
*  watches the TV? No, because it doesn't matter. It's cognitive dissonance. Israel has literally [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=806.96s)]
*  done this for the past 16 months. Why the fuck would they not do it further? They did it with [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=813.76s)]
*  the Biden administration and the Trump administration is even more aggressive in their [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=818.8s)]
*  like outward commentary on this. The Biden administration routinely allowed Israel to [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=823.68s)]
*  dog walk them over and over again. Why? Like if you if you teach Israel that you're never going [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=829.04s)]
*  to actually hold them to account and that they can violate whatever bullshit red lines you're [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=834.7199999999999s)]
*  presenting in front of them, why would they not do this? You know, yeah, this journal is a [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=840.0799999999999s)]
*  terrorist sympathizer. Why would she have on an interview a member of a terrorist organization who [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=844.56s)]
*  exactly Yeah, what you're supposed to do is sit around, close your eyes and assume that every [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=849.04s)]
*  every Palestinian person is an illogical monster barbarian. Okay, they're barbaric rapist monsters. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=856.3199999999999s)]
*  That's what you're supposed to do. You're not supposed to ever hear what they have to say. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=862.56s)]
*  You're not supposed to actually, you're not supposed to actually go, hmm, I wonder who's [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=866.7199999999999s)]
*  really violating these deals over and over again consistently. Okay, a deal we have, we were [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=870.4799999999999s)]
*  committed strictly to the deal. Unfortunately, all the time, Netanyahu and his government were [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=876.88s)]
*  trying to undermine the deal to sabotage the deal. They have committed a lot of violations, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=884.96s)]
*  killed more than 100 Palestinians, prevented most of the basic needs of the Palestinians [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=892.24s)]
*  to enter the Gaza Strip. And lastly, the he has refused to release more. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=898.8s)]
*  How come the anger in Israel doesn't cause more pressure on Netanyahu? It has so far. That's why [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=906.32s)]
*  he had to do two ceasefire negotiations, but that's only a small part of the pressure. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=911.5200000000001s)]
*  It's not enough. The pressure is clearly not enough. None of these countries are they, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=917.2s)]
*  none of these countries actually care about popular mobilization until that popular mobilization [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=922.8000000000001s)]
*  turns into a literal rebellion. America included is a part of the failure of this tactic though, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=927.7600000000001s)]
*  that the rest of the world has been watching and Israel is cementing itself as a prius day, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=934.24s)]
*  regardless of what's being said in Israel proper. I mean, I think most people just want to [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=937.36s)]
*  stop thinking about that. You know what I mean? Most people want to just [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=943.12s)]
*  stop paying attention to this stuff. How do you not get unbelievably angry? People running [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=947.28s)]
*  defense for Israel publicly. I can't stand it. So many people do it. And, you know, if I want to [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=951.04s)]
*  operate in civil society without losing my fucking mind, I have to just kind of eat it a little bit. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=956.8s)]
*  That's it. In an effort to be as normal as possible, in an effort to be able to [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=962.08s)]
*  get people to charitably hear out my position and get people to recognize the humanity of [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=968.5600000000001s)]
*  Palestinians, I just have to, you know, sometimes hold myself back. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=974.48s)]
*  More than 600 Palestinians prisoners according to the deal, because we have released the six [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=979.44s)]
*  living Israelis. But what is Hamas' response to these violations? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=986.88s)]
*  We have said it and we have conveyed a clear and strong message to the mediators. We cannot [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=994.4s)]
*  continue talking or discussing any further steps if these 620 Palestinians are not released. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1001.52s)]
*  So when you say you're not going to continue discussing further steps, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1012.16s)]
*  so if we look at the immediate future, Hamas was due to release four bodies of Israeli captives [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1015.52s)]
*  this week. Is that going to go ahead? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1021.4399999999999s)]
*  All options are on the table, because before going to the next step, we have to be sure that [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1026.8s)]
*  the past step, which is releasing 620 prisoners, are already released, because Netanyahu is clearly [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1033.84s)]
*  sending strong messages that he is intentionally sabotaging the deal. He is preparing the atmosphere [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1041.84s)]
*  for returning back to the war. Therefore, what are the guarantees that he might take the other four [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1050.1599999999999s)]
*  bodies and again not release the agreed upon number of Palestinians plus the 620 Palestinians? [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1057.28s)]
*  Therefore, all options are on the table, not only what should happen on Thursday, but even [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1067.2s)]
*  the other elements of the deal. Phase two, I want to get to that in just a second. First of all, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1074.56s)]
*  I just want to put to you that Israel says it will release the 620 Palestinian prisoners [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1079.84s)]
*  if Hamas changes the way it hands over Israeli captives. Israel is calling these ceremonies with [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1086.72s)]
*  the stage and the captives being brought up onto the stage and holding certificates, humiliating. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1095.28s)]
*  Is Hamas willing to do that, to make those changes? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1102.32s)]
*  First of all, he can describe it as he will, but if he considers this as a humiliation, I think [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1107.6s)]
*  ICRC and a lot of human rights bodies have documented and bring a lot of [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1115.12s)]
*  proofs that our prisoners three, four days before being released are taken to isolation cells and [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1122.64s)]
*  torture them 24 hours, starved. Their families were threatened not to show any sign of joy that [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1129.76s)]
*  they have received, that they are receiving their children after 20, 30, 40 years. I think we are [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1139.2800000000002s)]
*  ready to discuss any option, any proposal, if it comes to the ship. But we want also to be sure that [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1146.48s)]
*  our prisoners are dealing with them. Second, I think we don't see this as a humiliation. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1157.04s)]
*  We have seen spontaneous acts from the prisoners, from the Israeli prisoners [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1163.6s)]
*  who for Netanyahu were outrageous, like kissing the head of one of the fighters. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1174.08s)]
*  No one asked him to do it, but he did it spontaneously. I think this was not a humiliation. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1181.28s)]
*  This is, he decided to do it alone. The other female combatants that were released as well, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1186.56s)]
*  threw up the peace sign and shit like that. Okay. Like this is, it's just like when the last time [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1194.4s)]
*  the dude dabbed up the Hamas people before getting into the car and Israel gets very [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1202.48s)]
*  mad at stuff like that. Okay. And what's, what's hilarious about it is that even if it is done [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1209.6s)]
*  under duress, it is still infinitely like it is still supposed to be a show to say like, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1216.96s)]
*  Hey, look at the treatment of the Palestinians. Israel does the exact opposite. They dump the [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1222.72s)]
*  Palestinians. They dumped their bodies after raping them to death. Okay. In an unsanctioned [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1228.48s)]
*  pile. Like I cannot believe that they were so mad about the ceremony. Like they were like, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1237.2s)]
*  how dare you? How dare you? How dare you put the family members in coffins? Okay. It is virtually, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1245.52s)]
*  it doesn't matter what they're doing. What matters is the reality that it happened. Okay. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1255.52s)]
*  What matters is not the ways in which Hamas is releasing the hostages because throughout this [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1261.9199999999998s)]
*  entire process, throughout this past month, throughout the first stage of the ceasefire, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1267.36s)]
*  Hamas would release hostages in a crowd. Israel will get mad. They would say you're mistreating [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1273.12s)]
*  our hostages. How the fuck, how dare you, how dare you release them in this commotion. Then they [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1278.56s)]
*  would do an orderly procedure and do this stage theater thing that they were doing. Okay. Or they [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1283.92s)]
*  would release the hostages on stage. Then they would get mad at that. They're like, Oh, you're [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1290.5600000000002s)]
*  using our hostages. You're using our hostages as a talking point. You're trying to show the world [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1295.1200000000001s)]
*  that your treatment in spite of the fact that you took them as literal fucking hostages. Okay. Which [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1303.04s)]
*  is already a cruel act in and of itself. But when you do that, you're, how dare you, how dare you [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1308.08s)]
*  try to make it seem like you didn't mistreat our hostages. That's propaganda. Fuck you. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1315.84s)]
*  Then they would go back to the commotion and they'd say, Oh, look, it's a commotion. Look at these [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1320.1599999999999s)]
*  animals. The point is there is no right way of releasing these hostages in the eyes of the, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1325.04s)]
*  the Israeli state because they're mad that the hostages were taken to begin with, which is [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1330.6399999999999s)]
*  understandable position. Okay. But they're extra mad because how dare they, how dare these people [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1336.16s)]
*  that are supposed to be captive, the Palestinian population actually lay a hand on us, actually [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1343.3600000000001s)]
*  strike back at us. That is what the anger, the true anger and resentment is. That's why there's [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1349.44s)]
*  no correct way of releasing hostages. Okay. Yeah. I saw this earlier as well. Exactly. A truly sick, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1354.96s)]
*  depraved culture says libs of Tik TOK for this. Okay. A performative funeral procession for [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1361.84s)]
*  dead Israelis is sickened depraved, but Israel dumping the bodies of 80 unidentified Palestinians [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1366.6399999999999s)]
*  likely from their torture chambers out of a truck into Gaza and leaving is Solomon dignified. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1370.9599999999998s)]
*  It's ridiculous. It's just fucking ridiculous. There's no, there's no correct way to do this. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1375.6s)]
*  That's it. There is no correct way for Palestinians to resist peaceful resistance means you get killed. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1382.08s)]
*  Okay. Violent resistance means you get killed extra hard. Please explain how was the genocide [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1387.92s)]
*  when 80% of the buildings were destroyed, but less than 5% are dead on the Arab side in Gaza. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1392.64s)]
*  Plus I don't recall Hamas and a warning to Israel prior to the attack, like Israel did in retaliation [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1397.04s)]
*  while their leadership built bunkers for themselves, but not their civilians. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1401.28s)]
*  Isn't there anything here that sounds wrong with you or is it the same Western powers are bad [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1404.64s)]
*  bullshit while you live in one? Yeah, dude, I'm simply saying America bad without giving you [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1408.4s)]
*  exact evidence. I mean, I think if you scratch the surface of this commentary right here, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1413.44s)]
*  you would probably understand why this is completely unacceptable. You literally actively [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1418.48s)]
*  said 80% of buildings were destroyed in Gaza, but not enough Palestinians were killed in the process. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1424.24s)]
*  How could you say this is a genocide? What a ridiculous fucking statement to make [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1430.3200000000002s)]
*  reverse the roles. Do you think October 7 would have been appropriate if Hamas had superior fire [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1435.6000000000001s)]
*  power? That's the crazy thing. Like Hamas actually wanted to do a genocide on all Jews, right? [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1442.24s)]
*  Palestinians just have this like antiquated anti-Semitic gene in them, right? And they wanted [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1448.16s)]
*  to, October 7 was a genocide. What Israel has done since then is not. Okay, so if Hamas had superior [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1453.28s)]
*  air power and completely controlled the airspace, had access to the literal Israeli, the actual [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1459.52s)]
*  Israeli population knew exactly who lived where, okay? And controlled the entirety of the Israeli [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1467.92s)]
*  population in an open air prison where they controlled all matter of trade. And then they [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1474.3200000000002s)]
*  dropped flyers on top of Israel. And then they fucking bombed Israel into oblivion. You would [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1478.88s)]
*  not have this added. You'd be like, it's a genocide. And I would say that too, by the way, if roles were [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1484.88s)]
*  reversed, yes, I would say that is a genocide. The fact that Israel is stronger is not valid. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1489.1200000000001s)]
*  It's not a genocide. What do you mean? Of course, what? This is such pure cope. Okay. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1496.32s)]
*  It's pure cope. How you doing back there? Okay. Yeah. If it's successful is not the argument you [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1503.44s)]
*  want to make. You know what I mean? Chatter said Arab side, you're debating an idea of soldiers. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1509.04s)]
*  Stop taking the bait, dumb ass. I mean, I'll fucking debate these motherfuckers all day every [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1512.8s)]
*  day. This is ridiculous. Role reversal in this situation would objectively lead you to understand [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1516.24s)]
*  that this is a genocide. Okay. If any Muslim population had 6 million to 8 million Jews [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1521.52s)]
*  trapped in an open air prison and they consistently fucking bombed it over and over again and killed [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1529.68s)]
*  a couple hundred thousand here and there and 80% of the fucking standing structures were reduced [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1537.04s)]
*  to rubble, you would literally be like, that's fucking genocide. That is the most genocide that [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1541.76s)]
*  has ever happened. What are you talking about? And I would be right there with you and openly [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1546.08s)]
*  acknowledging that that is as a matter of fact, genocide. Okay. If you bully me and I hurt you, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1551.12s)]
*  I will stand for a trial. What if you bully me? 75 years of endless occupation isn't simply bullying [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1557.12s)]
*  for the record. Okay. Like, I don't know what you're talking about. Is Israel an apartheid [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1566.0s)]
*  state or not? We can start there. If your answer is no, then you are already delusional and refusing [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1571.4399999999998s)]
*  to reckon with the reality. You forgot the partition plans? No, you don't understand. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1576.96s)]
*  It's not a genocide. It's a bantistan and an apartheid. Yeah. I don't, you just don't get it, [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1582.72s)]
*  dude. We just want to do bantistans, you know, like another country did. That was sick. That was cool [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1588.96s)]
*  when they did it, right? It's just an apartheid. Anyway, who rejected it? Israel has consistently [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1595.2s)]
*  either brought forth ridiculous proposals, they continue their domination. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1601.36s)]
*  Okay. Or outwardly denied any kind of reasonable proposition. Wait, hold on. Any kind of reasonable [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1606.48s)]
*  proposition offered by the Palestinian side? Lastly, I think it is not about the shape because [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1612.6399999999999s)]
*  we have a lot of violations. Again, more than 100 Palestinians killed. If he is talking about [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1618.96s)]
*  humiliation, he is already killing Palestinians. I understand the use of the word humiliating is [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1625.12s)]
*  provoking, but I also want to get to the bottom of it. This is the only thing that is preventing [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1630.32s)]
*  the release of 620 Palestinian prisoners. Is it a concession that Hamas is willing to make? [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1636.6399999999999s)]
*  Yes, we are ready to discuss all these issues, but we want to be sure that he is taking the [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1645.6799999999998s)]
*  decision to release our prisoners. So what efforts have been made then to have these discussions, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1653.52s)]
*  to have these movements forward in this sticking point? Again, if you can repeat it again, please. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1659.68s)]
*  What efforts are currently being made? What dialogue is happening to free up this stick? [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1667.44s)]
*  30 seconds into this video is a perfect explanation. So for those who missed it, [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1674.24s)]
*  today Hamas released six Israeli prisoners. And in exchange for these six prisoners, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1678.0s)]
*  Israel was supposed to release some 600 Palestinian prisoners. Now in today's release, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1684.4s)]
*  one of the Israeli prisoners in fact was kissing the foreheads of his captors or those who were [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1690.64s)]
*  moments prior to that, his captors, shortly before being released into the custody of the [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1697.3600000000001s)]
*  Red Cross and then back to be with their families. At the 11th hour though, Israel decided that it [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1704.16s)]
*  was not going to release these 600 Palestinians until Hamas guarantees that in all future exchanges [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1711.28s)]
*  that there will be no pump and circumstance and ceremony. So now I want to unpack a little bit [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1718.08s)]
*  about why that is. Now it's really important to keep in mind, and I cannot emphasize this enough, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1723.12s)]
*  Israel is a Jewish supremacist state. And as a Jewish supremacist state, Israel necessarily [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1729.6s)]
*  needs to see Palestinians in a complete and utter state of submission all the time. And that's why [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1736.72s)]
*  it was really important for the Israelis upon the first state. 100%. That's literally it. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1742.48s)]
*  That's it. I mean, yeah, anyone who understands the dynamic, anyone who's even a little bit [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1748.72s)]
*  well-read about this, that also simultaneously like sees, anyone who is even a little bit well-read [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1754.64s)]
*  about this or sees the Palestinians as human beings recognizes that reality. Everyone else [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1762.24s)]
*  that looks for alternative reasons is basically obfuscating the truth and trying to do propaganda [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1767.76s)]
*  for the fucking apartheid state. That's it. You can do that in many different ways. Some people [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1774.16s)]
*  out, many people actively will say, no, Israel's fucking awesome. All Palestinians, all Arabs are [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1778.72s)]
*  animals and they deserve to be killed. Okay. The fuck do you mean? The coward's way in this circumstance [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1784.64s)]
*  is to claim that you are pro-Palestinian. It's just that the Palestinians, their resistance is [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1791.76s)]
*  wrong and bad. You're pro-Palestinian emancipation, but place what is happening. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1797.76s)]
*  You're pro-Palestinian emancipation is just that, you know, you spend all of your time shitting on [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1806.3200000000002s)]
*  people who are advocating for Palestinian emancipation, or some people do this. Both [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1812.3200000000002s)]
*  side is awful shithead people causing this whole thing. Brother, if you're both sidesing [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1817.68s)]
*  the most powerful state in the fucking region, backed by the most powerful state on the planet, [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1823.44s)]
*  destroying all standing structures in an open air prison that they are the belligerent occupier of [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1830.64s)]
*  in direct contribution of international law, then you're basically saying you're pro-Israel. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1836.3200000000002s)]
*  This is the problem. Don't try to fucking both sides this shit. There is no both sides here. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1842.0800000000002s)]
*  That's ridiculous. That is my real red line. Okay. It's a cop out. Just fucking say with your chest. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1846.48s)]
*  Just be like, nah, Israel's awesome. It's a Western aligned nation and I like it. I think that's more [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1852.64s)]
*  honest. The issue here is people try to assume like a centrist role here. You try to assume [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1857.3600000000001s)]
*  a centrist role here. Like what about Hamas's leadership's billions? Dude, they're dead. What [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1862.72s)]
*  are you talking about? Israel assassinated the head of the Hamas Politburo, not a fucking militant. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1866.4s)]
*  The principal negotiator in a fucking Tehran, in a separate country, in a foreign adversary's capital. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1873.2800000000002s)]
*  Think about it this way. Hassan Nasrallah's funeral proceedings took place yesterday. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1880.16s)]
*  It was widely attended. Israel violated Lebanese airspace by flying over it. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1885.2800000000002s)]
*  It's like a fucking serial killer coming back to the scene of the crime and being like, yep, [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1892.48s)]
*  I did it at the funeral proceeding and being like, yeah, I did it with a gun, with the murder weapon [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1896.16s)]
*  and being like, yeah, what are you going to do about it, bitch? It's ridiculous. Everybody knows [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1900.72s)]
*  what's up. Everybody understands what's going on. They tweeted, yeah, they tweeted the photo of their [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1904.72s)]
*  low flying fucking planes violating the Lebanese airspace. People talk about like, oh, what about [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1912.4s)]
*  the leadership of Hamas making billions? Like, yeah, dude, how did Yahya Sinwar die? Israel for [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1919.1200000000001s)]
*  literally 60 months lied and said, oh, he's chained to like eight Israeli prisoners at all [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1925.04s)]
*  times as though Israel fucking stops itself from bombing places when there's Israelis in him. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1931.44s)]
*  Israel has killed a shit ton of hostages themselves personally, sometimes with [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1937.52s)]
*  direct conventional weapons, like sometimes literally shooting them in the fucking back [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1941.2s)]
*  as they're waving a goddamn white flag saying we're Israeli, we're Israeli. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1944.8s)]
*  Okay. They lied and said, oh, he's in the tunnels. They lied and said, oh, he's escaped. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1950.0s)]
*  He just wants all the Palestinians to die. How did, how did he, I have Sinwar die. He died [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1954.48s)]
*  fighting. That was a fucking lie. He went down fighting. You can cry about it all day. You can [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1958.16s)]
*  be like, he's a butcher. I think he's also telling us in Mar was randomly killed during a skirmish [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1962.64s)]
*  and not targeted by the Israeli occupying force. They didn't even know he was there when they had [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1968.4s)]
*  killed him. Yeah, exactly. Virtually everything that Israel says about its, its campaigns are, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1971.92s)]
*  I don't get it, man. You will be reasonable most of the time, but the moment this topic comes up, [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1977.76s)]
*  you become crazy. Can we recognize that both sides have done bad things at least in this [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1981.92s)]
*  entire situation is bad for both sides. Yes. Okay. And I have the atrocities that took place on [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1985.3600000000001s)]
*  October 7 still entirely are in the hands of Israel. And I don't mean like they directly [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1992.16s)]
*  killed every Israeli person. Okay. I'm not saying like as a Hannibal directive, [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=1999.44s)]
*  stop trying to both sides of the situation, Israel holds all the fucking cards. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2003.28s)]
*  That's just the reality of the situation. And people seemingly don't want to fucking recognize [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2008.5600000000002s)]
*  it. It's very frustrating. Okay. I don't get it, man. You're reasonable. Most of the time. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2013.28s)]
*  Can you also admit that the Warsaw ghetto uprising really escalated the Nazi, the, the [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2019.1200000000001s)]
*  Nazi maintenance of the concentration camps, you know, what were, what were Jewish people supposed [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2026.48s)]
*  to do in that situation? Not fucking resist, not rise up, you know? Oh, I'm sorry. Can you please [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2032.4s)]
*  recognize that the Nat Turner rebellion actually really stopped the abolitionist movement that in [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2038.96s)]
*  his tracks, can you openly admit that the ANC's militancy, including car bombs they use from time [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2043.2800000000002s)]
*  to time greatly extended the apartheid? There are no both sides only when it's said and done. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2049.44s)]
*  Okay. In the moment liberals still, still do routinely resist the standard. The standard [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2055.36s)]
*  of violence is always set by the oppressor, but they were not being killed in Gaza before October [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2062.32s)]
*  7. What Palestinians were not being killed in Gaza before October 7. First of all, on October 6, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2068.08s)]
*  Euro med monitor released a report saying that 2023 was the deadliest year for Palestinian children [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2076.08s)]
*  so far. Okay. And that wasn't just Gaza. That was the West bank. Okay. The fuck do you mean? [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2085.12s)]
*  There was no violence in Gaza. There was no one being killed in Gaza before October 7. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2091.84s)]
*  What are you talking about? Someone just showed this fucking dingus, the chart, please, the numerous [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2096.0s)]
*  mowing of the lawn operations that Israel's conducted in Gaza, man, I don't follow the stuff. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2101.2799999999997s)]
*  How am I supposed to know? Well, if you don't follow this stuff and you're not, you don't know [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2105.7599999999998s)]
*  anything. Why do you come in here and act like you know some shit? There are plenty of people [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2110.08s)]
*  that don't know anything. They at least have the decency to not try to fucking contest objectionable [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2115.04s)]
*  things like unconscionable violence. Whenever I describe it, look at this. Where's the, [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2121.68s)]
*  where's the one that just shows, not this one, the one that shows like Israeli casualties and [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2128.64s)]
*  Palestinian casualties side by side, 75 years of military occupation. The Israeli state, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2134.24s)]
*  the Israeli state was built. Okay. The Israeli state was literally built with mass ethnic [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2142.0s)]
*  displacement. The knock-up. I have no hope for the average American. They're all going to get us killed. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2149.2s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, there you go. Look at that. Please read or listen to 100 years of war in Palestine. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2156.24s)]
*  I don't think you're talking to me, right? Because this is a book that I've also recommended and read. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2162.4s)]
*  This is a chart from 2021, by the way, and it's just from 2008 to 2020. To watch this, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2166.8s)]
*  Gaza fights for freedom. I have, I've already watched this on stream. The thing is you don't [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2171.92s)]
*  even need to know, you don't even need to know what happened prior to October 7 to understand [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2177.6s)]
*  how this dynamic works because you can look at everything October 7 onward and recognize [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2183.76s)]
*  exactly how this shit works. That's the problem. So for the past 16 months, you must have fucking [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2191.04s)]
*  had your head in the sand or something. That's what's so crazy about this. Don't look at the [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2197.04s)]
*  last post of the chatter. Why? What did he say? I just came in here to watch Gunnar video reactions [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2201.36s)]
*  and then saw something I believe was false and chose to contest it. Okay. Well, now you know the [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2211.7599999999998s)]
*  truth. I hope you, I hope you change your perspective. It's crazy. I mean, that chatter [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2215.6s)]
*  basically that chatter basically is more open-minded than the overwhelming majority of chatters that [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2220.56s)]
*  come in here with idiotic fucking takes. I've been meaning to watch this BBC documentary that [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2226.3199999999997s)]
*  was pulled from the airwaves after one day, but I just don't know. I didn't tell him so calmly [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2231.68s)]
*  because he didn't immediately call me like a pro rape anti-Semitic terrorist because most people [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2238.88s)]
*  that come in here with contentious attitudes like that without any knowledge whatsoever of the [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2245.2s)]
*  situation will just immediately hit that line. There's a lot of gore amputations are shown and [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2249.6s)]
*  one of the children works directly with an ambulance crew. I have seen it. I haven't seen it, [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2255.2s)]
*  but read a lot about it. Yeah. That's the reason why I don't want to watch it. Cause I'm worried. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2259.2s)]
*  The only issue with the document that they pulled is that the translations from Arabic are not [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2262.64s)]
*  accurate or misleading intending to show people of Gaza with more resentment towards Hamas than [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2266.0s)]
*  they actually had at the moment. Holy shit. TOS 11. Oh my God. That's a lot of tannister in Gaza. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2269.6s)]
*  I E Hamas terrorists. So the BBC pulled this doc. Oh, nice. Good. Good. Understand something, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2275.7599999999998s)]
*  by the way, even before October seven, more than 50% of the gossum population was under the age of [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2280.96s)]
*  18. Okay. Or 50%, at least 50% of the gauze and population is under the age of 18. Okay. So when [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2285.92s)]
*  you're wondering like, why are there so many children? Okay. In documentaries or why are [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2294.16s)]
*  they taking an active role? It's because a ginormous percentage of the people that Israel is killing [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2299.2s)]
*  are children because a ginormous percentage of the gauze and population is children. Okay. Just so [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2306.08s)]
*  you understand when I say they're baby killers, this is what I mean. It is a literal fact. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2313.68s)]
*  BBC faces questions over Gaza films. Hamas link. Yeah, this is a baby Hamas is a child Hamas. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2319.68s)]
*  Unironically, like the depravity dude, the fucking depravity of pro Israeli people is, [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2326.24s)]
*  is so pro Israel is so crazy to me. Showing you this is terrifying for a lot of people who [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2332.7999999999997s)]
*  are pro Israel. And that's precisely the reason why they do everything and anything they can to [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2340.48s)]
*  disparage anyone that shows you the reality on the ground. Okay, it's that's it. That's it. That's [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2346.56s)]
*  that's the only thing there is no real conversation here. Are there anti-Semitic people who absolutely [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2355.7599999999998s)]
*  claim to care about Palestinians in an effort to launder anti-Semitic sentiment? Absolutely. There [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2363.36s)]
*  are 100%. Virtually every single person that claims that about me, however, knows full fucking well [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2369.2799999999997s)]
*  that I am not an anti-Semitic person. Okay. Speaking of which you shouldn't see it look like [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2376.7999999999997s)]
*  this fucking dipshit is still doing it. This guy literally has been doing it all day. Okay. All day. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2382.56s)]
*  Look at this. So I found that you were mixing up stories. One person possibly killed in Israel [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2388.08s)]
*  in holding bisexual assault deposit, dump bodies or bodies and Stanley sees by Israel from morgues. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2394.24s)]
*  Check if they held hostages in their morgues speaking. Oh, sorry. So when they dumped their [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2399.36s)]
*  bodies, they didn't intend to do it. They didn't intend to fucking humiliate the Palestinians. Got [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2403.12s)]
*  it. Speaking of which you shouldn't have said baby settlers thing. Yeah. The baby settlers thing, [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2408.3199999999997s)]
*  which is another thing that was ironically clipped when I was directly having a conversation with [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2412.56s)]
*  the person who then relitigated it a year and a half later. Ironically, my argument there, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2417.52s)]
*  considering that I'm a one stater is that regardless of valid military targets, okay. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2424.72s)]
*  Considering the West bank valid military targets as my interlocutor did at the time. Okay. I don't [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2431.2s)]
*  think it's appropriate. I don't think it's, it's, I wasn't advocating to kill baby settlers. You dumb [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2437.7599999999998s)]
*  fuck. It was the opposite. That is precisely the reason why I say that I am an advocate for a one [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2443.04s)]
*  term. I mean, one state solution because I think it's cruel. Now that there are 700,000 people that [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2449.44s)]
*  live there, I think it'd be cruel to forcibly rip them. That's so crazy. It's so crazy. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2456.24s)]
*  Virtually everything that disingenuous fucking assholes, oh, wait, 80% of buildings destroyed [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2462.3999999999996s)]
*  as in genocide. We call it we were genocide one because they imprisoned people, reeducate, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2468.4799999999996s)]
*  maybe kill a few. That's genocide. How was this not? This person is literally saying this person [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2471.7599999999998s)]
*  is literally taking the most insane stance here. He recognizes what Israel is doing is genocide, [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2476.72s)]
*  but then still has fallen for a fucking clip. Chimp. What you should check out oldest son [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2482.4s)]
*  via is Hassan does nothing wrong. The truth isn't important. Just say whatever gets views. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2486.4s)]
*  Hassan does nothing wrong. Wait, what very confusing stuff here. So I'm giving you the [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2491.2000000000003s)]
*  correct, I'm giving you what my position is, but then you just turn around and say this shit. Like, [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2495.2000000000003s)]
*  am I not supposed to, am I not supposed to correct you and just act like, yeah, no, I did indeed have [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2502.48s)]
*  a position that I don't have. What a strange, what a strange situation. So you expect us to [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2508.56s)]
*  live next to our rapists. Hassan, I mean, you can't expect us to live next to the people who [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2513.36s)]
*  kill our families and children because it'd be cruel for them to go back to the country they [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2516.56s)]
*  invaded from. The unfortunate reality is that that is precisely how history has worked forever. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2519.2s)]
*  Okay. Every single person that has done a crime should offer restitution for it. This doesn't [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2526.16s)]
*  mean that those crimes should go on addressed. Okay. But that's the underlying basis creating [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2532.32s)]
*  a truth and recalculation reconciliation committee and then addressing all of the wrongdoings. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2539.1200000000003s)]
*  That's it. Anyway. Okay. So don't articulate yourself when you're literally saying, well, [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2545.44s)]
*  there are babysitters in a conversation about targeting children in war. Like, yes, you can [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2556.0s)]
*  walk it back now. That's not my problem. I'm not walking it back now. You idiot. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2559.12s)]
*  That's not how conversations work. That's not my problem. I knew that was going to trigger you [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2564.4s)]
*  because you never check yourself. Okay. Well, you know, have fun with that. That's not how [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2569.12s)]
*  conversations work. You can't just literally be like in a back and forth conversation, [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2574.0s)]
*  you applied terminology that could be clipped out of context. That's on you. What do you mean? [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2578.4s)]
*  The fuck are you talking about? Don't you care about what my actual position is? Like, [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2583.8399999999997s)]
*  what do you mean? You just want to argue. You're like, I know that that's not your position, [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2588.8s)]
*  but it's really fucked up that you were, you allowed yourself to be clipped out of context [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2592.0800000000004s)]
*  by the person I was having who knows my actual opinion on the matter. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2596.32s)]
*  The fuck months later to a year later, get the fuck out of here. There's nothing funnier to me [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2599.84s)]
*  than being a guy who's like, honestly, I know that that's not what you meant, but I'm still [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2605.04s)]
*  going to act like you meant it. Cause I'm bad faith. You're just like openly recognizing that [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2610.32s)]
*  you're fucking bad faith. Yeah. Says a lot about you that I fucking got duped. I guess [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2614.64s)]
*  new Israeli deputy Knesset speaker calls for killing all Palestinian men in Gaza, wiping out [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2619.52s)]

*  Civilians went out and slaughter people in cold blood. We need to separate the children and women [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2633.92s)]
*  and kill the adults in Gaza. We are being too considerate. He described the people in Gaza as [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2637.2s)]
*  scum and sub humans claiming no one in the world wants the civilians in Gaza. Everyone is pushing [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2641.76s)]

*  state solution, including in that very same conversation that I was having with Ethan, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2727.44s)]
*  would you actually go back and say, you know what I'm wrong? I was wrong. I actually was misguided [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2731.44s)]
*  on this. Or do you think you'll move on to a different goalpost? I don't think you would move [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2737.6s)]
*  on. I think you would just move the goalpost to something else. Meanwhile, the IDF has confirmed [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2741.8399999999997s)]

*  to see. That's not true at all. What do you mean? What's not true at all? Do you think you have a [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2758.08s)]
*  better accounting of all of the things that I've said in my eight to 10 hours of fucking commentary [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2761.6s)]

*  clipped and you think that you have a better understanding, like the audacity. Can you imagine? [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2772.08s)]
*  Especially because not only am I a fucking public figure, but I'm also endlessly consistent and very [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2779.12s)]
*  careful. No, it's not true that I would move the goalpost. So why the fuck are you moving? Why are [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2785.2s)]

*  this is the first time you've shown compassion. You fucking idiot. The question I gave you was a [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2795.6s)]
*  rhetorical one. It's because I have shown compassion to all civilians across the board, [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2800.8s)]
*  but you're in here guided by one fucking clip that you saw that was out of context. And you think [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXeoYozYlw&t=2808.0s)]
