**HasanAbi:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8)
*  I can't begin to explain to you how much I despise Randy Fine. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=0.0s)]
*  An absolute monster. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=3.84s)]
*  Okay? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  He is such a freak. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=7.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=9.44s)]
*  They really do a good job of drowning out all the supposed anti-Semitism they complain about [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=9.84s)]
*  with this endless flow of Islamophobia, which no one cares about. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  Okay? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=17.44s)]
*  No one. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=18.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=23.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=24.32s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=25.2s)]
*  Finally. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  Finally, dude. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=27.36s)]
*  I tweeted about this last night. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=28.8s)]
*  I tweeted about this last night. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=30.64s)]
*  Randy Fine coming after, like, not just Ilhan Omar, but, like, there are so many [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=31.84s)]
*  Republican congresspersons alongside Randy Fine are basically clam posting about Muslims [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=36.72s)]
*  on this website every single day, and not a single major outlet has talked about it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=45.28s)]
*  Not single. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  Not a single one. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=51.92s)]
*  They are talking about Zohran Mamdani's SAT scores. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  They're writing extensively about how Zohran checked a box, like, almost 20 fucking years [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=60.32s)]
*  ago to a college administration, or to a college admissions paper that he didn't even end up [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=67.84s)]
*  going to. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=74.4s)]
*  Okay? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=75.04s)]
*  He didn't even go to Columbia. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=75.28s)]
*  They're writing reports on this. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  No one cares that Randy Fine is like, Muslims are violent, barbaric demons. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=78.64s)]
*  Like, that's what he keeps posting every day. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=83.92s)]
*  Every day. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=86.4s)]
*  That tub of lard of a person is routinely like, oh my God, kind of like how you get [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=87.44s)]
*  special treatment on Twitch Law. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=94.64s)]
*  Clansmen have and always will be Democrats. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=95.92s)]
*  All enemies of the Jews have always been fair game. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=98.0s)]
*  Muslims, Christians, whites. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=99.92s)]
*  Islam is cancer. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  We don't want it in our country. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=101.84s)]
*  Shut up. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=103.04s)]
*  Clam posts, get the fuck out. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=103.44s)]
*  Bro, the only people taking you seriously these days are autistic furries. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=105.52s)]
*  You jerk off the cartoons. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=108.56s)]
*  I hate this goddamn platform, man. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=110.48s)]
*  It is so ass. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=112.08s)]
*  It is so ass, dude. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=113.92s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=115.44s)]
*  Anyway, not trying to bring back 2016 woke here, but come on, hard not to notice how [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  heinous you're allowed to be as long as you're committed to Israel. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=120.8s)]
*  Well, here it is. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=123.2s)]
*  We got Hakeem Jeffries, at least. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=126.0s)]
*  This will probably drive discourse a little bit. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  I suspect this will cause the media to cover it a little bit. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=130.56s)]
*  Our statement in connection with Randy Fine's Islamophobic attack against Congresswoman [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=133.84s)]
*  Ilhan Omar. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=137.2s)]
*  The unhinged racist and Islamophobic comments made by Randy Fine about representative Ilhan [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=139.52s)]
*  Omar are bigoted and disgusting. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=143.12s)]
*  We're just weeks removed from heinous acts of political violence targeting elected officials [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=144.72s)]
*  in Minnesota for assassination. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=148.08s)]
*  This is an incredibly difficult time for our nation and members of Congress should be [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=149.6s)]
*  solving problems for the American people, not inciting violence. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=152.8s)]
*  Randy Fine must apologize immediately. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=154.88s)]
*  Notice how the ecology applied to gives a damn that that happened like, you know what [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=156.72s)]
*  does it have to do with this article? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=160.4s)]
*  Maybe we'll cover that in a second. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=161.84s)]
*  Someone photoshopped his ass so hard he had to get up from it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=165.2s)]
*  Get up, get up from his ass with his own gravitational pull and do something. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=169.36s)]
*  Yeah, Randy Fine should be censured and expelled from Congress. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=173.68s)]
*  This is what was what was going on, by the way. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=176.48s)]
*  Ilhan Omar, this is Benjamin Netanyahu's third visit to D.C. this year. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=178.8s)]
*  War criminals should not be welcomed by any president or Congress. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=181.52s)]
*  He should be held accountable for his crimes, not platform beyond shameful. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=184.08s)]
*  I'm sure it is difficult to see us welcome the killer of so many of your fellow Muslim. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=187.6s)]
*  The only shame is that you serve in Congress. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=191.84s)]
*  I can't begin to explain to you how much I despise Randy Fine. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=194.56s)]
*  An absolute monster. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=198.4s)]
*  Okay, he is such a freak. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=201.2s)]
*  Yeah, they really do a good job of drowning out all the supposed anti-Semitism. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=204.0s)]
*  They complain about this endless flow of Islamophobia, which no one cares about. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=207.28s)]
*  Okay, no one. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=212.0s)]
*  I'm look, I eat it every day. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=213.35999999999999s)]
*  Okay, I eat it every day. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=216.4s)]
*  It's fine. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=217.84s)]
*  It is what it is. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=218.72s)]
*  There's not really anything I could do about it. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=219.44s)]
*  This is just a system that we live in. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=220.95999999999998s)]
*  I don't think we're going to be able to change people's minds anytime soon. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=223.12s)]
*  I don't think we're going to be able to change people's minds anytime soon. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=227.44s)]
*  It's just a thing that every person who is of Muslim background, Muslim origin, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=229.92s)]
*  or in many instances, just perceived as Muslim, even if they're not like [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=236.48s)]
*  a shit ton of Sikh people, for example. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=240.72s)]
*  All of these people, we just got to eat it. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=245.04s)]
*  There's not really much you can do about it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=247.76s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=250.24s)]
*  Wait, hold on. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=250.88s)]
*  Doors open. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=257.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=257.84s)]
*  Do you think people care more about anti-Semitism than other types of [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=258.24s)]
*  bigotry because they're white? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=260.32s)]
*  They're white. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=262.4s)]
*  But more importantly than all of those things, anti-Semitism can be used as a weapon to [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=263.2s)]
*  shield criticisms of America's most valuable ally in the region, Israel. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=270.4s)]
*  You look weird today. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=275.52s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=276.88s)]
*  Why? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=277.44s)]
*  Libs comparing Zoran the David Duke. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=278.08s)]
*  Why do people that shit on New York City all of a sudden care who the mayor of New York City is? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=280.64s)]
*  I mean, because it's a real threat. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=283.84s)]
*  It's an ever-present threat to America. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=286.56s)]
*  You can't have a socialist anywhere near power. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=291.35999999999996s)]
*  Obviously, you can't have a Muslim anywhere near power. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=293.67999999999995s)]
*  You can't have a socialist anywhere near power. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=295.28s)]
*  It's a Muslim socialist. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=296.96s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=298.0s)]
*  Cam is a bit blurry. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=304.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's because I'm using the laptop camera because I'm currently charging my regular camera. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=305.12s)]
*  If you just eat it, aren't sending the message that it's acceptable. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=310.88s)]
*  Yeah, most people probably won't have sympathy, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=313.44s)]
*  but unless people start fighting back against Islamophobia, how will it ever change? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=314.96s)]
*  I mean, I do a good deal of that. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=318.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm doing it right now. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=320.56s)]
*  I'm in the process of talking about Ilhan Omar and demanding that the media actually create [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=321.52s)]
*  some kind of counter pressure against this unlimited wave of Islamophobia that we're seeing. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=325.76s)]
*  That's me doing something about it. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=331.59999999999997s)]
*  That's me demanding something happen. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=333.91999999999996s)]
*  But there's a limit to how much... [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=337.2s)]
*  I obviously have my expectations on how successful that could be as someone who is [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=340.56s)]
*  a regular recipient of Islamophobia tags every single day. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=353.68s)]
*  As soon as I said it, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=363.44000000000005s)]
*  I'm in the process of talking about this and someone goes, nope, they sparked networks. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=367.84s)]
*  No international should be placed into power in any country. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=372.4s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=375.84s)]
*  No international should be placed into power in any country period. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=376.32s)]
*  Like what the... [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=379.2s)]
*  What the fuck is this guy saying? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=380.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, SAD is a black dude dealing with anti-blackness on a regular basis. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=381.59999999999997s)]
*  I feel you. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=384.47999999999996s)]
*  No, this is what I mean. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=384.88s)]
*  There is a level of anti-black sentiment that every black person will instantly rise up to, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=387.84s)]
*  right? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=394.8s)]
*  And there's a past a certain point, like every black person will come out and be like, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=395.28s)]
*  shut up. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=400.8s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=401.44s)]
*  This is unacceptable. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=402.96s)]
*  Shut up. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=404.24s)]
*  And it's the same with Islamophobia as well. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=405.2s)]
*  Anti-blackness obviously is way more nefarious, way more insidious, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=407.91999999999996s)]
*  way more baked into the collective consciousness of American foundations. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=411.2s)]
*  So it's more complicated. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=415.2s)]
*  But for that reason, because of its newness, I would say, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=419.44s)]
*  because of its contemporary application, Islamophobia is more deliberate, it's more direct. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=423.36s)]
*  You can just go around and be like, oh, you're Muslim? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=428.88s)]
*  Anti-black hate has to be a little bit more sneaky [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=432.48s)]
*  because of the centuries of anti-blackness that have evolved. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=436.40000000000003s)]
*  And it's also a part of America's foundation. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=441.52000000000004s)]
*  Islamophobia is not a part of American foundation. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=446.88s)]
*  It's more recent. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=450.96000000000004s)]
*  It's more new. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=451.84000000000003s)]
*  So it doesn't have to be more nefarious or hidden. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=452.96s)]
*  Would you go to a country like Japan or China and take a political position? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=458.56s)]
*  I mean, I have gone to a country like Japan. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=462.32s)]
*  I've gone to Japan and have taken a political position in Japan [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=465.12s)]
*  that is contrary to the Japanese government's official position. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=469.2s)]
*  I literally went to the opposition party, Communist Party's headquarters, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=471.67999999999995s)]
*  and interviewed members of the fucking Japanese Communist Party. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=475.28s)]
*  So yes, the answer is fucking yes. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=479.2s)]
*  In any case, you sound so disappointed as Sanjoban is the worst president in our history, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=481.36s)]
*  though his career is riddled with corruption. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=484.96000000000004s)]
*  They're all human. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=486.40000000000003s)]
*  Iran is a terror state. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=487.52000000000004s)]
*  Them getting nukes is a huge no-go. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=488.88s)]
*  Why do you think the nukes is bullshit? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=490.8s)]
*  Call it what you want. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=492.32s)]
*  I just want this crap to be over. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=492.96000000000004s)]
*  War is freaking stupid. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=494.32s)]

*  It's on and you know it. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=498.8s)]
*  If people are Islamophobes, does that make you a kosher phobe? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=499.92s)]
*  No, that would make me an anti-Semite if I said something anti-Semitic. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=503.04s)]
*  It's not kosher phobe. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=507.2s)]
*  I don't know why you were trying to fucking make a joke about this. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=508.48s)]
*  Which I am not, despite the fact that people will also, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=511.84000000000003s)]
*  in a cynical and in a very racist way, try to claim this. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=515.92s)]
*  Terrorism is context sensitive. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=520.16s)]
*  It's not inherently a negative term. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=521.44s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=522.88s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=523.92s)]
*  Queer is dual use. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=524.5600000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=525.92s)]
*  When a homophobic person calls someone a fucking queer, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=527.12s)]
*  they're obviously using it as a slur. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=530.24s)]
*  When I'm talking about queer liberation, it's obviously not a slur. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=532.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=537.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=537.78s)]
*  We're not doing the one man's terrorist, another man's freedom fighter, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=538.98s)]
*  especially because my analysis over like militant resistance against the state of Israel [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=542.5s)]
*  or against the United States of America, for example, and American imperialism [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=549.3s)]
*  is the academic context that we talk about. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=552.8199999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=556.74s)]
*  That is precisely the academic context in which I cover these events and these [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=558.18s)]
*  these non-state actors. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=562.98s)]
*  And yet I get called a fucking terrorist every goddamn day. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=565.7s)]
*  Demands to what? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=569.14s)]
*  What the fuck are you talking about? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=570.5s)]
*  You clearly are dismissing centuries of Islamophobia. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=571.62s)]
*  This led to genocide after genocide in Europe and across the MENA by European kings. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=573.62s)]
*  I'm talking about America. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=577.14s)]
*  What the fuck are you talking about? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=578.58s)]
*  I'm Turkish. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=580.74s)]
*  Do you think that I'm not very aware of European Islamophobia [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=581.86s)]
*  and the role that it played against the Ottoman Empire in particular? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=589.0600000000001s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=593.14s)]
*  It's a prominent part of the history that I learned. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=595.54s)]
*  I'm talking about the United States of America. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=598.74s)]
*  Islamophobia has never been a important fixture in American history. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=601.46s)]
*  That's not a thing, especially in comparison to anti-blackness. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=607.54s)]
*  Anti-blackness in the United States of America, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=612.66s)]
*  anti-black sentiment in the United States of America is more perverse and more significant [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=616.1s)]
*  than anti-blackness as a universal concept because anti-blackness is a universal concept, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=621.86s)]
*  for sure. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=629.94s)]
*  But anti-blackness in America is way different than that. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=632.74s)]
*  Islamophobia, especially in the way that we understand it, is like a post-9-11 invention. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=635.94s)]
*  It existed to some form against Iran and whatnot, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=640.74s)]
*  but never to the same degree. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=644.82s)]
*  It never had such a stranglehold on American discourse until after 9-11. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=647.62s)]
*  You are just factually wrong. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=655.7s)]
*  Please stop. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=657.7s)]
*  You are wrong on this. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=658.9000000000001s)]
*  Columbus thought the natives were Muslim, dog. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=659.7800000000001s)]

*  Are you fucking stupid? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=667.38s)]
*  I'm talking about America, man. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=668.9000000000001s)]
*  Americans, Americans, 1776 Americans. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=671.54s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=676.74s)]
*  It's not a comparison. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=678.98s)]
*  Anti-blackness and anti-indigenous... [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=680.98s)]
*  He came to America. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=685.38s)]

*  Guys, please see yourself out of this conversation, okay? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=688.9s)]
*  You are misunderstanding my point. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=693.3000000000001s)]
*  Anti-black racism and anti-indigenous racism, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=695.46s)]
*  the otherization, the dehumanization, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=700.02s)]
*  played two different roles, but they are foundational to American existence. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=702.5s)]
*  There is no comparison between these two historically with Islamophobia. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=708.42s)]
*  Most Americans didn't know what the fuck a Muslim was until recently. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=713.46s)]
*  They still don't fully comprehend it. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=719.86s)]
*  I'll give you a great example of this, okay? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=722.5s)]
*  Euro-racism versus American racism. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=725.06s)]
*  That's why Europeans will always say, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=727.62s)]
*  Americans are so obsessed with black people and blackness. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=729.22s)]
*  And to a certain degree, that is true. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=733.38s)]
*  Anti-blackness exists in Europe as well, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=736.34s)]
*  but it's different than anti-blackness in America. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=738.18s)]
*  Anti-blackness in America is foundational. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=741.3s)]
*  Anti-blackness in Europe is certainly a very real bigotry that exists and persists, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=745.0600000000001s)]
*  but it's not the same as anti-blackness in America. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=750.58s)]
*  Yeah, they even use the slur for black people to insult Muslims. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=753.14s)]
*  That's true. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=756.26s)]
*  That's actually a really good point. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=757.14s)]
*  They say, N and N-word for Muslims. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=758.74s)]
*  That's how much anti-blackness is a prominent fixture. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=762.9s)]
*  I didn't even think about that. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=766.66s)]
*  You're right. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=767.54s)]
*  As someone who is a recipient of the Sand N-word form of racism with regular frequency. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=767.9399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvZ_HFzM_8&t=775.3s)]
