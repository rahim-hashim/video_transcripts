*  I don't know. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6753.46s)]
*  I haven't done a lot of embarrassing things recently, [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6754.3s)]
*  which is surprising, [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6755.82s)]
*  but I did eat shit once in front of my crush in high school. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6756.66s)]

*  Double meanings. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6768.78s)]
*  So I lived in my neighborhood. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6771.82s)]
*  I had a hill. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6773.74s)]
*  I lived on top of that hill. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6774.94s)]
*  My crush, I also went to school with, [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6777.3s)]
*  lived on the same street. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6780.66s)]
*  I boarded, I was boarding on a longboard down the hill, [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6782.38s)]
*  and I basically tumbled and rolled and fell in front of him. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6786.900000000001s)]
*  I shit, bleeding everywhere. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6790.900000000001s)]

*  I guess. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6799.02s)]

*  I know. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6903.660000000001s)]
*  But I was at a dance competition [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6904.5s)]
*  and I was really nervous [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6906.900000000001s)]

*  It was really obvious. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6921.9400000000005s)]
*  But they did feel bad for me. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6923.34s)]
*  They gave me the award for the best costume. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6926.22s)]
*  I didn't even perform. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6930.18s)]

*  Not that bad though. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6937.46s)]
*  There was this one time- [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6938.3s)]
*  Did you pee on stage too? [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6940.3s)]
*  Nah, I took a shit in a girl's bathroom [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6941.38s)]
*  and I didn't want her to know. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6943.18s)]
*  So I dug my hands into the toilet [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6945.14s)]
*  and I put it into her shower drain. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6948.54s)]
*  Shower drain? [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6950.7s)]
*  Shower drain. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6951.54s)]
*  I'm not gonna smell that shit. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6952.42s)]
*  No. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6953.42s)]
*  Jason, that's the most sociopathic thing [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6954.26s)]
*  I've ever heard in my life. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6956.26s)]
*  You waffle stopped it? [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6958.86s)]
*  No, no, no, [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6960.06s)]
*  because I flushed it so now it's like shredded poop. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6960.900000000001s)]
*  So I put the shredded poop into the shower drain [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6963.54s)]
*  and it clogged. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6966.34s)]
*  It was clogged because her hairs were in it. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6967.18s)]
*  So I turned the water on and now it's poop water. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6969.34s)]
*  So I took her tweezers, [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6971.1s)]
*  unclogged her shower drain, [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6972.5s)]
*  and- [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6975.54s)]

*  celebrating what they're celebrating the decision right now. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6977.62s)]
*  Listen, I tweezed out all of her hair [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6981.78s)]
*  so I cleaned her fucking bathroom. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6985.219999999999s)]
*  That's true, you did her a service. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6986.5s)]
*  And then the water went down the drain. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6988.34s)]
*  Things were better and then, yeah, [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6990.98s)]
*  thoroughly cleaned her tweezers, [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6993.259999999999s)]
*  thoroughly cleaned my hands [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9kr05vpT4&t=6994.34s)]
