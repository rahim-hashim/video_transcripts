# Iron Dome Can’t Keep Up | Hasan Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [June 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw)
*  Well, what you're seeing live on your screen right now, we're seeing projectiles over the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=0.0s)]
*  skies of Tel Aviv. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=5.4s)]
*  Moments ago, the Israeli military did that Iranian had been Iran. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=8.36s)]
*  Now we know that the travel time of Iranian is roughly around 12 minutes. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=16.64s)]
*  Iran threatens to intensify attacks of Israeli hostilities persist. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=23.08s)]
*  The IRGC added that Iran strikes on Israel targeted fuel production facilities for fighter [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=32.04s)]
*  jets and energy supply centers. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=35.839999999999996s)]
*  CNN has not been able to independently verify its claim. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=38.0s)]
*  How do you not, how are you failing to independently verify the claim? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=41.32s)]
*  You have people in Jerusalem, you have people in Tel Aviv, you can just literally go to [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=44.92s)]
*  the area of impact and look at it with your eyes. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=50.76s)]
*  What do you mean you have no way of independently verifying that claim? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=54.4s)]
*  This makes no sense whatsoever. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=58.839999999999996s)]
*  Is a Psyop to confuse the enemy LMAO instead of marching they land on the Red Square in [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=61.4s)]
*  Moscow like they did this so many years ago? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=64.84s)]
*  Once Israel started striking the oil, I think that's why China now suddenly checking shit [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=67.0s)]
*  out. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=70.24s)]
*  Iranian drone strike just now in Eilat. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=71.24s)]
*  It's because the occupiers are arresting anyone who's sharing photos or information [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=73.24s)]
*  out there. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=90.08s)]
*  The reports can certificate because they'd be arrested for verifying it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=91.08s)]
*  I mean, not really. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=94.6s)]
*  But yeah, they they lit up the they lit up Haifa. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=96.11999999999999s)]
*  That big barrage that we saw had a bunch of successful hits. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=101.36s)]
*  And that was in Haifa. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=106.28s)]
*  Also the siren, if you guys notice, came after the explosion, which is interesting. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=108.19999999999999s)]
*  IDF expects another attack is coming soon. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=124.96s)]
*  The IDF Home Front Command as of two minutes ago has instructed civilians to remain near [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=127.36s)]
*  shelters as another wave of ballistic may be launched soon by Iran. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=131.32s)]
*  BBC seems to have veered from the Israel line in this report. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=134.72s)]
*  Destruction all around BBC reports from Israeli city targeted by Iran. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=139.08s)]
*  IDF said more than 200 were fired as a part of the Iranian response to large scale attacks [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=141.6s)]
*  carried out by Israel. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=145.2s)]
*  They've urged residents to stay alert. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=146.2s)]
*  He said, adding the authorities in Israel are indicating that this could be the beginning [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=147.2s)]
*  of a prolonged campaign against Iran. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=150.2s)]
*  At a certain point, Israelis that have Israelis that are used to their comforts, I assume [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=153.12s)]
*  will say, why are we doing this? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=160.0s)]
*  Why are we doing this? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=163.12s)]
*  And you can make the same argument for the Iranian public as well. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=165.04s)]
*  However, the difference in this circumstance is Israel initiated this. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=168.68s)]
*  OK, that's a major difference. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=174.0s)]
*  If Iran did the first strike against Israel, then this would be a very different conversation. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=177.0s)]
*  The very fact that Israel initiated the first strike against Iran while Iran is in the process [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=182.84s)]
*  of denuclearization negotiations after three decades of playing ball with international [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=188.4s)]
*  authorities like it's just a completely indefensible position for Israel. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=196.16000000000003s)]
*  What is this? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=202.4s)]
*  This feed is just Trump, just Trump. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=203.4s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=206.0s)]
*  It's only showing just one hour and 19 minutes of just Trump so far. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=207.52s)]
*  And there's 20,000 people watching intently. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=213.96s)]
*  This shaky ass camera of just Trump. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=218.8s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=222.92000000000002s)]
*  God, MAGAs are so stupid. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  They're gooning the Trump. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=226.24s)]
*  They really are. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=227.8s)]
*  Such madness. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=230.0s)]
*  Vegan control of the military. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=231.0s)]
*  Take note of where the civilians are sitting. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=233.8s)]

*  We're hearing about these operations. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=445.8s)]
*  It appears that we're having some signal issues with Clarissa Ward. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=447.8s)]
*  We just lost her signal, but we will do our best to get it back. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=450.8s)]
*  That's right. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=454.8s)]
*  We have been, as we do try to reestablish it, let's just talk a little bit about what [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=455.8s)]
*  we've been seeing. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=458.8s)]
*  We've been seeing those Iranian missiles just kind of obviously try to overwhelm those [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=459.8s)]
*  air defenses in Israel. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=464.8s)]
*  And in so many cases, as we see here, you have the ability of the Iron Dome to stop [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=466.8s)]
*  those ballistic missiles, but not every one. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=474.0s)]
*  And that is why we are hearing about some casualties. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=476.0s)]
*  We have been able to reestablish Clarissa's signal. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=479.0s)]
*  Let's get back to her now. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=482.0s)]
*  Clarissa, tell us the latest. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=483.0s)]
*  Hi, Brianna. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=484.0s)]
*  I actually lost signal then because just as you were about to come to me, an alert came [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=485.0s)]
*  through on my phone and to the phones of every single person in Israel of the detection of [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=490.0s)]
*  possible missile launches towards Israel. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=497.0s)]
*  The alert citing a number of places that might be told soon to take shelter Jerusalem among [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=500.2s)]
*  them. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=507.2s)]
*  We don't have any more information than that at this stage, but this is the first time [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=508.2s)]
*  I would say in three or four hours that we have received this kind of a warning early [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=512.3s)]
*  on in the evening when we heard a similar warning. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=518.04s)]
*  There were a number of Iranian missiles falling down around Haifa in the north of the country [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=521.84s)]
*  and particularly on an Arab town called Tamra. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=528.3s)]
*  Now we know from Israel's emergency service. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=533.3s)]
*  And I guess there it is. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=536.3s)]
*  According to Alex Ward, national security reporter at Wall Street Journal, there were [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=539.3s)]
*  reports after days of entertaining the back and forth new Iran Supreme Leader Ali Khomeini [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=544.3s)]
*  Khomeini is not off limits from targeting as Israel proceeds with his intensive air [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=551.3s)]
*  campaign in Iran and Israeli officials said Saturday the official said Israel wasn't [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=556.3s)]
*  ruling out any potential targets to destroy the nuclear program, including common a the [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=561.3s)]
*  officials comments furthered offered further indication that Israel's attacks against Iran [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=567.3s)]
*  are aimed not only at his nuclear program, but also hobbling the regime politically and [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=572.3s)]
*  militarily. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=576.3s)]
*  And we're we're there. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=577.3s)]
*  This is where we're at. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=579.3s)]
*  And you could just see the damage that is inflicted when one of these ballistic missiles [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=580.3s)]
*  does make impact when the Iron Dome is not able to intercept it. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=585.3s)]
*  There were multiple houses completely destroyed. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=590.3s)]
*  The cars on half of the block were like crumpled coke cans. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=593.3s)]
*  And for many Israelis, this is something they haven't seen before. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=599.3s)]
*  This is not the Catoosha rockets or mortars in terms of the types of munitions that they're [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=602.3s)]
*  familiar with seeing. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=608.3s)]
*  So there were a lot of people who were gathering in the area, standing back at the police [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=610.3s)]
*  court and trying to sort of crane their necks to get a better glimpse of the destruction [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=616.3s)]
*  that had been caused by this one impact. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=622.3s)]
*  So people now in various parts of the country are intensifying a little bit, keeping their [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=625.3s)]
*  phones very close as they wait to get more guidance from the home from command on whether [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=629.3s)]
*  it will be necessary for them to take shelter in the coming minutes and hours. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=635.3s)]
*  All right, Clarissa, thank you so much. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=642.3s)]
*  So glad we were able to reestablish that connection. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=644.3s)]
*  Obviously, things can get dicey here as they are getting alerts and there are sirens going [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=646.3s)]
*  off. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=651.3s)]
*  Also happening right now, a military parade that is taking place here in the nation's [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=652.3s)]
*  capital commemorating the U.S. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=657.3s)]
*  Army's 250th birthday. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=659.3s)]
*  Moments from now we expect to hear from President Trump as he takes part in a reenlistment [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=662.3s)]
*  ceremony. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=666.3s)]
*  Let's talk about this now with Republican Congressman Warren Davidson of Ohio. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=668.3s)]
*  He is. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=671.3s)]
*  Bro, get back to showing me fucking Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, OK? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=672.3s)]
*  Sirens on the Jerusalem feed. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=684.3s)]
*  Sirens on Tel Aviv. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=688.3s)]
*  We're watching the Jerusalem skyline. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=692.3s)]
*  I'm not seeing it. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=696.3s)]
*  Iranian attacks on Israel in April and October of last year, they destroyed the radar for [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=706.3s)]
*  it and that renders the system ineffective. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=713.3s)]
*  The homegrown Iranian air defense systems, Bavar and other variants, which are mostly [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=716.3s)]
*  reverse engineered copies of Western and Russian systems have proven to be ineffective. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=722.3s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=728.3s)]
*  We countered. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=729.3s)]
*  I think that this is due to several factors. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=730.3s)]
*  The first is that's coming right at the area where the camera is. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=732.3s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=736.3s)]
*  To smooth or blind air defense radar. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=738.3s)]
*  The second is that Israel had a number of agents and has a number of agents probably [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=741.3s)]
*  to include armed forces personnel who they've inserted on the ground who have attacked air [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=747.3s)]
*  defense facilities from the missiles in the Jerusalem skyline as well. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=752.3s)]
*  But the third, and this shouldn't be overlooked, is the role of corruption in the Revolutionary [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=756.3s)]
*  Guard, specifically in the Iranian regime in general. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=762.3s)]
*  And history shows us we've seen this particularly with the Russians in the war in Ukraine, which [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=765.3s)]
*  has not achieved the success I thought it would achieve. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=770.3s)]
*  That that Chinese foreign minister holds call with Israeli and Iranian counterparts. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=774.3s)]
*  For example, some of the Bavar systems were supposed to have business recorder components [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=779.3s)]
*  that cost more. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=784.3s)]
*  But a Revolutionary Guard corps officer, an air defense officer, substituted a cheaper [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=785.3s)]
*  part and pocketed the money. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=791.3s)]
*  After Israel to Middle Eastern powers exchange fire a day after Israel initial president [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=794.3s)]
*  China foreign minister released separate statements late Saturday announcing Wang's phone calls [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=799.3s)]
*  with his counterparts. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=803.3s)]
*  Wang first spoke to the Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi telling him Beijing supports [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=804.3s)]
*  Iran and safeguarding its national sovereignty, defending its legitimate rights and interests [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=808.3s)]
*  and ensuring the safety of its people. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=811.3s)]
*  Iran enjoys close ties with China. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=813.3s)]
*  Beijing is his largest commercial partner and the main buyer of its oil with Tehran still [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=816.3s)]
*  under crushing U.S. sanctions. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=820.3s)]
*  Wang told Araghchi that Israel's actions seriously violate the basic norms of governing international [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=822.3s)]
*  relations and noted the attacks on Tehran's nuclear facilities have set a dangerous precedent [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=826.3s)]
*  with potentially catastrophic consequences. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=830.3s)]
*  Wang told SAR that China clearly opposes Israel's violation of international law by attacking [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=833.3s)]
*  Iran with force calling its behavior unacceptable. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=837.3s)]
*  Let me tell you something, okay? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=840.3s)]
*  I'll believe it when I see more more emotion from China. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=842.3s)]
*  The parade is showing future weapons and vehicles. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=852.3s)]
*  We're really proud to be here represent the 101st and the army and really show the world, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=855.3s)]
*  you know, what our soldiers do every day. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=862.3s)]
*  This is the most ADHD stream we've had so far. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=864.3s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=867.3s)]
*  This the drone there looks similar to the one I have really small what I have. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=868.3s)]
*  But obviously what the army is using, what the army has developed isn't that literally a DJ? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=872.3s)]
*  Like these are all Chinese drones at home. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=877.3s)]
*  And this is something again, I think it's interesting when you think about the development, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=880.3s)]
*  Kelly, of the army over the course of the last 250 years, so much of the technology, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=884.3s)]
*  so much of the everyday things in our homes were developed by army engineers and army [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=890.3s)]
*  scientists and have been put into practical use the Internet. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=895.3s)]
*  And there are kids here a child at heart, but there are young kids in along the parade rap who [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=898.3s)]
*  see that drone and are probably excited to see that and probably not to use it already. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=904.3s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=908.3s)]
*  And it obviously gives a capability that allows for protecting the lives of service members [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=909.3s)]
*  because they're unmanned, of course, a precision, just holding it up in his hands. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=916.3s)]
*  Hearing about drone strikes when there are operations that are happening in the modern [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=922.3s)]
*  moment, and it gives people a sense of what does that look like? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=927.3s)]
*  It is another chance to have a window into what is the modern military. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=930.3s)]
*  And there's a real gee whiz back into this as well. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=936.3s)]
*  That you can see a real gee whiz back in real life, so to speak, you're getting a chance to see [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=939.3s)]
*  this new kind of capability. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=946.3s)]
*  And Colonel Miners, you're still with us here. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=947.3s)]
*  The notion of robotics becoming an increasingly useful tool in the army is something that is [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=949.3s)]
*  becoming more and more real there, right? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=956.3s)]
*  Yes, sir, absolutely. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=960.3s)]
*  I think you made a great point there that what these machines, these robots, these drones do [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=961.3s)]
*  is protect the lives of service members. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=967.3s)]
*  So a drone can see things farther than an infantry soldier with his binoculars. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=970.3s)]
*  So he can simply launch that unmanned aerial system, spot-find, and in some cases kill the enemy [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=976.3s)]
*  before he's even in danger himself. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=982.3s)]
*  Missiles above. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=985.3s)]
*  Video shows Iranian ballistic missiles heading towards Israel. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=987.3s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1010.3s)]
*  Is this actually, is this making people tell Aviv going crazy? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1011.3s)]
*  Ooh, they got one. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1016.3s)]
*  That one's going in. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1018.3s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1038.3s)]
*  Israel, Jerusalem, a short while ago and explosions were heard. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1046.3s)]
*  What you're seeing now is Tel Aviv. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1052.3s)]
*  It's still going. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1055.3s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1057.3s)]
*  Well, BB isn't Santorini, dude. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1063.3s)]
*  Oh, they got that one. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1065.3s)]
*  Dude, I'm going to be honest. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1076.3s)]
*  I don't think these are Hamas bathtub rockets, bro. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1092.3s)]
*  It doesn't feel like these are, it doesn't feel like these are Hamas bathtub rockets. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1094.3s)]
*  You're currently watching different angles. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1107.3s)]
*  I've always wondered if the iron dome works. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1109.3s)]
*  I mean, it works. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1112.3s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1113.3s)]
*  But it's not unlimited. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1114.3s)]
*  And it does appear based on what we just saw that there may have been multiple direct hits on Tel Aviv once again. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1116.3s)]
*  Now the flares in the sky, as our viewers will know by now, did they knock out the power in Tel Aviv? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1124.3s)]
*  And this is not, there's still energy. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1130.3s)]
*  Israel's air defenses. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1132.3s)]
*  Remember that Israel has multiple layers of air defenses, whether it's Arrow, whether it's iron dome, whether it's David Sling, as they're known, which are all designed to intercept different types of missiles. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1134.3s)]
*  Short range rockets, medium range, long range. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1147.3s)]
*  It is known, however, that depending on the number of missiles and the speed and the trajectory, those systems can sometimes be overwhelmed. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1150.3s)]
*  And they're also not a hundred percent, meaning that some of the missiles do get through, which is what we saw 24 hours ago and 48 hours ago. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1157.3s)]
*  Earlier today, Iranian missiles hit the city of Haifa, Iranian state TV reporting that they hit energy infrastructure in Israel's Haifa. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1163.3s)]
*  Now, Iran had promised a very strong response. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1173.3s)]
*  This is not the first volley of missiles that we have seen incoming into Israel today. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1177.3s)]
*  And there may be more during the night. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1183.3s)]
*  Bro, how are there no watching? How are there no ads on the stream? I think this is over. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1186.3s)]
*  I think this round of, of rockets is over. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1191.3s)]
*  There are no ads on the stream because it's sponsored by you, the viewers for you, the viewers, the piker broadcasting services ad free. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1194.3s)]

*  They have disarmed Iranian air defense systems over the western half of the country, allowing Israeli fighter jets a clear passage to the capital. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1208.3s)]
*  We have this report now from Al Jazeera's Bernard Smith in the Jordanian capital. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1218.3s)]
*  This latest wave of Iranian missiles has hit targets. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1223.3s)]
*  We understand at least in Haifa report city in the north of Israel and the reports of casualties from there. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1227.3s)]
*  There was no sirens this time. So the threat not considered significant enough there to send people to their shelters in Jerusalem. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1235.3s)]
*  The Israeli military also says as regards Iran, it now I'm going to move over. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1244.3s)]
*  I'm going to downtown LA in Iranian airspace from the west of the country to Tehran. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1249.3s)]
*  Earlier, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that soon Israeli jets will be flying over to Iran and we will hit every site and target of the Iranian regime. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1254.3s)]
*  We know that Israel has changed the focus of its attacks now from degrading Iran's nuclear capabilities to attacking infrastructure targets, hitting Bandar ass ports. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1264.3s)]
*  And that is one of the headquarters of the Iranian Navy and also hitting gas. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1276.3s)]
*  It's major gas production field. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1281.3s)]
*  Israel's president, Isaac Herzog, he said this country is at an historic crossroads. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1285.3s)]
*  It's not just our struggle. It's a struggle for all who seek peace and looking ahead to the G7 meeting in Canada on Monday. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1292.3s)]
*  He's called for all leaders there to unequivocally stand and work, stand with Israel at this critical moment. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1300.3s)]
*  These, of course, leaders of countries who have become increasingly critical of the way Israel is conducting the war in Gaza and some seeing this attack on Iran as a way to deflect attention. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1308.3s)]
*  From what Israel is doing in Gaza. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1321.3s)]
*  Bernard Smith, Al Jazeera, Amman. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1324.3s)]
*  And Al Jazeera's Dohe Desadi reports now from Tehran. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1326.3s)]
*  Tensions and escalations are ramping up to an unprecedented level between Iran and Israel. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1329.3s)]
*  Iran is now striking back after Israelis started military operation strikes across the country, targeting different, let's say, nuclear, military and civilian weapons. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1335.3s)]
*  And civilian places inside Iran and here in the capital from time to time we hear sounds of explosion. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1350.3s)]
*  But tonight the Iranian forces and in particular IRGC announced that they have started a new round of attacks to the Israeli territories using drones and ballistic missiles. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1358.3s)]
*  And also we heard from an Iranian high ranking security official saying that Iran has prepared itself for a prolonged confrontation and that it's going to increase its attacks to the Israeli territories. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1374.3s)]
*  This situation looks highly complicated as both sides are talking about their intention to increase attacks. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1391.3s)]
*  But how future could unfurl is something for which we have to wait and see. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1400.3s)]
*  Dohe Desadi, Al Jazeera, Tehran. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1406.3s)]
*  Israeli forces have placed the occupied West Bank under siege, sealing the entrances of cities and villages with iron gates and concrete barriers. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1409.3s)]
*  Movement has become severely restricted as Palestinians say they are caught in the crossfire of the Israel-Iran escalation. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1418.3s)]
*  Ned Abraham reports. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1426.3s)]
*  As life comes to a standstill in Israel, Palestinians in the occupied West Bank are under a lockdown. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1428.3s)]
*  In particular, of course, and how and where they have gotten here over the years and the different experiences that they have all had and seeing it through the parade. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1435.3s)]
*  Kelly, Aaron. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1443.3s)]
*  All right, Alison, thank you. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1444.3s)]
*  We should note that we've moved into the future portion of the parade here and you just saw, we believe. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1446.3s)]
*  The West Point cadets. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1452.3s)]
*  The United States Military Academy at West Point. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1454.3s)]
*  Yes, and certainly they represent the future officers, an elite group, a very difficult course of study and then they spend years of service after that. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1456.3s)]
*  So I believe they were members of the class of 2025, so recently graduated and will be serving around the world in leadership positions. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1468.3s)]
*  We're seeing this in the order that was indicated. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1476.3s)]
*  These may be some newer soldiers, the initial entry training soldiers, if this is in the right order here. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1479.3s)]
*  When I was growing up, we called that basic training, but I think that's the name has changed and some of the training has changed. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1489.3s)]
*  But those are some of the young people who I believe are in that program now. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1495.3s)]
*  Obviously, we saw the West Point band and cadets. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1500.3s)]
*  We are seeing some of the military academies on display here at this point. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1504.3s)]
*  The Citadel is noted here. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1508.3s)]
*  Also, the ROTC Reserve Officer Training Corps from Texas A&M, a part of this. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1510.3s)]
*  And the Virginia Military Institute. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1518.3s)]
*  There you go, VMI. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1520.3s)]
*  As a Virginia boy, I have to note that. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1521.3s)]
*  And obviously, that is a very prestigious appointment for a young man or woman to be included in these military academies. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1523.3s)]
*  They are exposed to a lot of important theory about warfare, understanding the technology, but really training great leadership skills. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1532.3s)]
*  And it's a hard duty and a very impressive position to be in. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1543.3s)]
*  And certainly, they represent the future of leadership in the United States Army. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1549.3s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1553.3s)]
*  They will be the doers and thinkers of tomorrow coming up with the new ideas, leading the way on all the technology that we've been talking about developing [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1554.3s)]
*  and determining how our soldiers and other branches of the military, for that matter, will execute the work that they will be tasked with doing in the next generation of warfare. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1565.3s)]
*  We are approaching the top of the hour here, nearly 8 o'clock on the East Coast, as we get to the, I think, final images of the parade proper that we were anticipating here, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1578.3s)]
*  as these young people again representing the future are where we are at this point in our military's history. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1591.3s)]
*  And so we know that there are several elements to this parade that we expect to see or elements to this celebration of the Army that we expect to see before the evening wraps up. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1600.3s)]
*  A little bit ahead of schedule. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1611.3s)]
*  We know we started about a half an hour early because there were concerns about the weather. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1612.3s)]
*  The weather has been threatening and there's thunderstorms in the forecast and obviously they wanted to try to get through this so that people would not, certainly soldiers can manage when it's raining, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1617.3s)]
*  but they wanted this to look good and to be appealing to families. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1626.3s)]
*  And we expect that this next ceremony and the reason these service members are paused is that there is an expectation of a re-enlistment ceremony. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1629.3s)]
*  So they've already served a term of commitment to the Army and are willing to raise their hand again and swear the oath. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1640.3s)]
*  And that is a part of the video that we believe is playing. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1649.3s)]
*  And this is quite an extraordinary moment if they are having an opportunity to choose to serve for an additional period at an event as unique as this one. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1652.3s)]
*  And I think there may be some new enlistees mixed into this group here as well, but largely re-enlistment, as we noted, about 250 people we've been told taking advantage of this opportunity to stop at the reviewing stand in front of their commander in chief. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC7QOIy_EPw&t=1663.3s)]
