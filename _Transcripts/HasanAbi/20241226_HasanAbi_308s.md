# Severe Weather Is Delaying All Activities | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [December 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ)
*  Try so a cruising altitude. You can't breathe. Yeah. No, that has happened. I know. I remember [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=0.0s)]
*  watching one of those like weird tick-tock like Zach B videos or whatever, where two [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=6.140000000000001s)]
*  people actually climb into the, climb into the wheel base or whatever. And then when [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=13.5s)]
*  the wheels pull in, let's get started. Severe weather coast coast threatens. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=19.98s)]
*  This morning, a white or wet Christmas throughout the country means millions may be dealing with a travel mess on their way home from the holidays. Millions across the south are facing severe storms, including flash flooding with as much as four inches of rain. And police in Sherman, Texas, with the grim task of searching for a person swept away in floodwaters. One body was recovered, while four others in the car were rescued. The only thing that I can communicate to the public or anybody who's who's wanting to go back to their home country is that we're seeing an increase in traffic. So we're seeing a lot of a lot of a lot of people who are in the state of Texas. The state of Texas is [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=29.86s)]
*  to do more is simply pray for a quick and successful recovery. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=59.86s)]
*  The west coast facing an unrelenting atmospheric river storm with powerful winds, heavy rain [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=64.32s)]
*  and snow. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=69.5s)]
*  In California, officials are assessing the damage after part of the Santa Cruz pier collapsed [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=70.5s)]
*  under high surf. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=74.82s)]
*  Three people were plunged into the water and authorities say a man at a nearby beach died [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=76.34s)]
*  after being trapped under debris by a wave. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=81.22s)]
*  That wharf now closed indefinitely. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=84.03999999999999s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=85.7s)]
*  Meanwhile, in the sky, travelers facing... [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=86.7s)]
*  Meanwhile, it's 64 degrees in sunny in Los Angeles, dude, where it's like, it's 64 degrees [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=88.86s)]
*  and sunny out here. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=95.17999999999999s)]
*  Like, maybe the last two days it was like a little, it was a little gray, but that's [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=96.69999999999999s)]
*  it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=101.53999999999999s)]
*  Thousands of travel delays after chaotic start to the busy holiday travel rush with [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=102.53999999999999s)]
*  a nationwide ground stop for American Airlines. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=106.53999999999999s)]
*  American Airlines computers are down. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=109.25999999999999s)]
*  We're deep cleaning. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=112.13999999999999s)]
*  It comes amid a series of scares on airlines and in airports over the holiday. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=113.5s)]
*  overnight in Phoenix, police responding to reports of gunfire at sky Harbor airport, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=117.94s)]
*  creating for some momentary chaos. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=122.42s)]
*  Okay, but you don't have to gloat. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=123.89999999999999s)]
*  Honestly, I'm not even gloating. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=126.02s)]
*  Like for me, for me, the weather being this nice in the midst of Christmas season is kind [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=127.7s)]
*  of lame. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=132.9s)]
*  This is the one time out of the year where I kind of wish I was like at least seeing [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=134.38s)]
*  a little bit of snow. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=138.88s)]
*  And yeah, no, it absolutely is coming from a place of weather privilege. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=141.3s)]
*  I guess Alaska here. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=145.66s)]
*  It's not snowing. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=147.66s)]
*  It's bullshit. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=148.66s)]
*  Check your weather privilege. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=149.66s)]
*  White man. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=150.66s)]
*  I know. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=151.66s)]
*  They say the incident happened between a group that knows each other. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=152.66s)]
*  Four of them were injured, two others detained. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=154.42000000000002s)]
*  And in Hawaii, an investigation is underway after a body was found in the wheel well of [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=157.18s)]
*  a plane after landing in Maui from Chicago. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=161.46s)]
*  What the United Airlines saying in part quote, the wheel well was only accessible from outside [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=163.7s)]
*  the aircraft, adding it is not clear how or when the person accessed the wheel well. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=169.14000000000001s)]
*  Now we have been talking about what is expected to be record breaking holiday travel. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=174.34s)]
*  If you are one of those travelers still taking to the skies or the roads in terms of the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=178.66s)]
*  airports, we expect it of course to be busy today, but not as busy as tomorrow or Monday [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=182.7s)]
*  is expected to be according to TSA. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=187.42000000000002s)]
*  And if you are taking to the roads, keep in mind we enjoyed two days of minimal traffic, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=189.82s)]
*  but AAA does say they expect that to creep back up starting today. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=194.02s)]
*  So if you're hitting the roads, Laura, maybe pack a nice playlist so you can have your [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=197.5s)]
*  patience and enjoy nice music on the way. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=201.5s)]
*  That never hurts. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=204.22s)]
*  That's not pressurized. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=205.22s)]
*  So a cruising altitude, you can't breathe. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=206.22s)]
*  Yeah, no, that has happened. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=208.3s)]
*  I know. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=210.54s)]
*  I remember watching one of those like weird tick tock like Zach B videos or whatever, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=211.54s)]
*  where two people actually climb into the, climb into the wheel base or whatever. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=217.78s)]
*  And then when the wheels pull in, I think one guy actually survived it. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=224.82s)]
*  Like one guy literally survived it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=230.54s)]
*  I don't know how, but the other guy died, which is kind of wild. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=232.38s)]
*  What's up? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=236.5s)]
*  Oh, you want the phone here? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=237.5s)]
*  Marissa. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=238.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=239.5s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=240.5s)]
*  Let's check in with Dylan right now. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=241.5s)]
*  She is in for, I hope you had a nice Christmas by the way with all the boys. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=242.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's the one. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=244.46s)]
*  I'm busy. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=245.46s)]
*  I've got a lot to clean up right now. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=246.46s)]
*  Folks today, if you are traveling, it looks fine up and down the East coast, weather wise, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=248.57999999999998s)]
*  at least it's a little bit chilly, but not as cold as it has been. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=252.42s)]
*  It's really down through Texas into Eastern Oklahoma, down through Arkansas and Louisiana. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=255.3s)]
*  And also out West, we have another storm system making its way on shore. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=260.94s)]
*  That means rain and mountain snow, very difficult getting through the mountain passes. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=262.86s)]
*  We could see some delays because of the heavier rain in Seattle, also in the Portland to Dallas [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=266.54s)]
*  and Houston, especially later on today when those storms really get going. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=271.18s)]
*  We could see some of those delays at the airports and again, the roads through the mountain [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=274.5s)]
*  passes. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=278.1s)]
*  Some of the snowier spots will be slick going and also slow going down South where some [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=279.1s)]
*  of that rain could be a little heavy at times. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=282.68s)]
*  So it's this cold front that's moving eastward across Eastern Texas, down through Louisiana, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=284.94s)]
*  up across Arkansas. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=289.62s)]
*  So as we go into this afternoon and evening, we'll start to see the heavier rain and the [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=290.62s)]
*  thunderstorms. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=293.94s)]
*  There's also some morning fog in the Midwest that could create some slowdowns and some [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=295.14s)]
*  delays at the airports early this morning. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=298.74s)]
*  But then as we go into tomorrow, I do do weather. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIeyCqNTgQ&t=300.82s)]
