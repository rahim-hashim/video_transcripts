# Zohran Mamdani Schools Andrew Cuomo In Debate For Mayor | Hasan Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ)
*  Oh, I see. So every contract that the MTA contracts you want me to be held responsible? This one? Yes, because [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Workers got cheated out of two and a half million dollars and their health care and the orders bad luck. Yeah, so you boomers hate [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=7.28s)]
*  When someone just says ah, it's not my responsibility six billion dollars per year [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  They have multiple what do you want to be mayor then jackass if you're not going to be responsible new york? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=21.28s)]
*  Anyway, the mayor the mayoral debate is soon to begin in 2021. I was covering her campaign [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=30.8s)]
*  Nobody thought she was really going anywhere. She was the sanitation commissioner people were surprised that she was even running and then boom [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=36.56s)]
*  One day on a sunday the new york times came out for kathryn garcia [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=44.4s)]
*  It changed the entire race and she became katelyn. Jenner is dividing lgbtq's really the tel aviv pride guest of honor [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=47.6s)]
*  Is going to try to use this [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=54.32s)]
*  And push this forward with the same momentum, but it just it's not the same the new york times has decided not to weigh it [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=56.4s)]
*  It's not the same but I do think it's spell territory. Like we know it's not the same [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=62.08s)]
*  we're watching it each and every day, but [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=66.96s)]
*  If you're a new york time subscriber and you have been waiting for them to give you know, their their seal of approval to a candidate [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=71.68s)]
*  You know are you parsing whether or not it was the editorial board or this panel i'm not sure [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=80.08s)]
*  It will be very interesting to see I think this is an experiment that the new york times is engaging in [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=85.36s)]
*  Um, I would have certainly seemed to like to see them do a full-throated endorsement [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=89.84s)]
*  I'm sure the candidates would have liked it a lot sooner as well [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  Um, but I do think it's a test and I do think it will be hard for the candidates on stage tonight [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=97.76s)]
*  To unexplain it the way you just did if lander does proclaim that he is the new york times editorial panel endorsed candidate [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=103.52s)]
*  How do you take that away? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=111.92s)]
*  Greg you're shaking your head. You don't think this matters. I don't think endorsements have the weight that they did even four years ago [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=113.12s)]
*  Why because there is an absolute cataract of content that is shot in everybody's phone every moment [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=119.2s)]
*  That it just doesn't have the impact that it used to have and and again this I agree with you that [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=126.72s)]
*  They made I talked about alex pd already, you know seven people, uh who [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=133.83999999999997s)]
*  Brad lander definitely has seven votes. I can say that definitively [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=139.11999999999998s)]
*  The timing on this though is tricky [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  There is a little bit of indication in some of the polling that lander's got a little bit momentum [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  He's clearly sort of in third place [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=150.23999999999998s)]
*  But adrienne adams also just went up on air because she was laid into the race and just got her public matching funds [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=151.6s)]
*  I think we're going to see some very interesting polling at the beginning of next week early voting will have already begun [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=156.72s)]
*  but in [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  This final week 10 days [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=163.68s)]
*  I think we're going to see some indications that things have shifted even in one of the polls that came out this week [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=165.52s)]
*  not necessarily [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=170.72s)]
*  Indicative of exactly where the race is at in the next to last round lander was within three points of mamdani [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=172.24s)]
*  For who would go on to be against cuomo in the final round [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=178.72s)]
*  There's a lot of there's a lot of potential movement here [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=182.0s)]
*  And I think the question of whether cuomo's numbers come down further in these polls to come [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=184.32s)]
*  is really something worth watching because that's [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=189.28s)]
*  Some of the trend here, I think yeah [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=194.08s)]
*  I mean even in some of the you know the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=195.44s)]
*  Internal polls have been flying around people are putting out tons of polls about how he's the winner [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=197.76s)]
*  She's the winner, etc [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=201.36s)]
*  But the last legitimate poll that was out there was from emerson college a couple of weeks ago [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=202.72s)]
*  And it said that andrew cuomo's unfavorables were 47 percent and everyone in new york city [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  I would think mostly everyone in new york city knows who andrew cuomo is so how do you even change any of those minds? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=214.56s)]
*  What? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=219.92s)]
*  That leaves 53 50 if all 53 percent rank him ahead of mamdani then he's in good shape adrian adams by the way [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=222.0s)]
*  There was a weird episode yesterday where she put out a post on social media attacking mamdani [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=229.83999999999997s)]
*  Sort of and then took it down [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=234.88s)]
*  But then later said that she still sort of stood by meanwhile mamdani actually encouraged people to give her money [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=237.67999999999998s)]
*  So I don't I don't really know whether she's decided whether to attack him or not [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=243.2s)]
*  Her team said that she did not write this tweet basically it was a video of mamdani on msn [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=246.79999999999998s)]
*  NBC a couple of days ago saying that [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=253.2s)]
*  I should be abolished that's worth watching tonight. Yeah, adrian adams mamdani. I think all right guys [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=255.67999999999998s)]

*  It's not talent that we lack we've got the best and brightest nor money [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=632.8s)]
*  We spend double that of any other city in the world its leadership and we can't afford amateur hour in city hall anymore [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=636.4s)]

*  That's why we need a mayor who's experienced competent and can get things done not a social media phenom with cute videos [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=648.8s)]
*  Someone who can balance the budget and make tough choices not [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=656.0s)]
*  Pie in the sky promises that there's no realistic plan to pay for and someone who will keep us safe by ending chaos [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=659.76s)]

*  In new yorkers look as the leader of the city council leading the most diverse [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=700.4s)]
*  City council in the history led by women majority. I realize what leadership truly is [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=705.6800000000001s)]
*  I'm already doing the job. I have successfully negotiated three city budgets and now in the middle of negotiating my fourth city budget [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=710.72s)]

*  Damn, I don't have a famous father. I'm not the best at tik tok. My daughter is here all her videos do better than mine [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=745.36s)]

*  That's why today the new york times opinion panel said i'm the best choice for mayor [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=776.72s)]
*  I've got the public integrity that new yorkers deserve the progressive values that new yorkers [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=781.76s)]

*  And before you ask i'll pay for it by taxing the rich the same billionaires who put donald trump back in the white house [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=805.04s)]
*  The same ones who are funding andrew cuomo's campaign like many new yorkers. I wasn't born in this country [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=810.96s)]
*  But I grew up in the city and it's one that we're in danger of losing. We're under attack from a [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=816.16s)]
*  Fortarianism from the outside and an affordability crisis from the inside yet [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=822.54s)]
*  If you turned on your television 20 years ago, you'd have heard the same tired failed policies [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=826.24s)]
*  You'll hear from politicians tonight. It's time for a new generation of leadership [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=830.64s)]
*  And that's exactly what my campaign is building a movement of more than 36 000 volunteers [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=834.64s)]
*  Who have knocked on nearly a million doors and left us just two points away from city hall [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=839.6800000000001s)]

*  Uh, everyone has a plan as you've heard everyone always has a plan [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=864.48s)]
*  Uh, that's always the way but the question for tonight is who is the ability to get the job done? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=869.36s)]
*  That's really the question who can build [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=876.64s)]
*  Housing I built housing across the nation as hud secretary I built la guardia airport cashew scope bridge second avenue subway [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=881.04s)]
*  And more who can do public safety? Well, my colleagues were defunding the police. I was adding more police [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=888.24s)]

*  And who can take on donald trump that is the big question [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=902.08s)]
*  The cities all across this country [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=906.88s)]
*  But he never sent them into new york when I was there and he never will when I am mayor [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=909.12s)]
*  A job looks easy when you haven't done it [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=915.12s)]
*  Experience matters. I will get the job done. I will work for you [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=918.7s)]
*  24 7 [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=924.38s)]
*  Thank you for your opening statements candidates mr. Cuomo many new yorkers are concerned about what's happening in los angeles [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=926.7s)]
*  workplace immigration raids and deportations [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=933.5s)]
*  protests with some violence the president's deployment of the national guard and the marines over the objection of the governor and the mayor [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=936.52s)]
*  The trump aide steven miller said the mayor has no say if you were mayor of new york right now [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=943.9s)]
*  How would you handle this situation if something like that happened here? Yeah [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=950.38s)]
*  Um [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=955.26s)]
*  We had this situation before right? This is not a case of first impression [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=956.22s)]
*  President trump did this in trump one. He did it a number of times [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=960.78s)]
*  He sent troops into cities all across the country. This is him being macho [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=964.22s)]
*  Authoritarianism he's the commander in chief [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=969.5600000000001s)]
*  He never sent them into new york because I said to him you better never send troops into new york [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=972.7s)]
*  We don't need them. It would be a hostile act. It would be a problem [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=979.5s)]
*  Right now in this situation. We're going to protect our immigrants [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=984.06s)]
*  This is a sanctuary city and we are going to defend the laws of the sanctuary city [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=988.46s)]
*  We have an nypd that is the largest police force in the united states of america [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=993.8199999999999s)]
*  Donald trump only picks fights that he can win [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1000.06s)]
*  He cannot win a fight with me. Yeah, because you're aligned. He also already has a doj case on you [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1003.9s)]
*  You're compromised, you know, what is so troubling to see right now is we also have [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1011.66s)]
*  The nypd assisting ice in some of those very missions right here in new york city [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1016.6999999999999s)]
*  We saw the strategic response group arrest a pastor who was peacefully observing the arrest of a migrant at federal plaza [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1021.26s)]
*  When I am the mayor the nypd will serve public safety of new yorkers [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1028.54s)]
*  They will not assist trump's ice agents and furthermore though. Donald trump may not believe in the law [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1031.98s)]
*  We have to be clear that we do and we will in fact bring back our law department to its pre-pandemic staffing levels [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1037.42s)]
*  200 additional lawyers and start to provide lawyers for immigrants who are in deportation cases because we know that by doing so [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1043.3400000000001s)]
*  We in fact increase their likelihood of coming home to their families in new york city by 11 times [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1050.46s)]
*  Finally, we can see examples in previous mayoral administrations where the mayor's team like steve banks and the last administration [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1055.18s)]
*  Took every single step they could to ensure that none of the personal information the city had would be turned over to the trump administration [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1062.6200000000001s)]
*  I would follow that example through all of our agencies say that he's compromised by the doj [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1068.8600000000001s)]
*  Oh big class on this topic [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1074.3000000000002s)]
*  But with kind of a a follow-up if the president sees what he thinks is disorder in the streets [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1076.3000000000002s)]
*  And believes that local and state law enforcement officials are not doing a good job at protecting citizens and property [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1082.3000000000002s)]
*  Why shouldn't he step in his supporters say that's his responsibility [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1089.26s)]
*  We are right now dealing with a lawless president enacting lawless behavior across this entire nation [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1094.1399999999999s)]
*  As one who continued to speak up and out against donald trump [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1101.1799999999998s)]
*  Currently, uh donald trump would like to bring ice back onto reichers island, which has been illegal since the year 2014 [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1105.02s)]
*  Through an executive order put forth by the deputy mayor of the city of new york [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1112.2199999999998s)]
*  Not the mayor of the city of new york, which is unprecedented [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1117.1s)]
*  They want to bring ice back on to reichers island and the person that she is the baddest ag in the nation [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1120.3s)]
*  Her name is tish james. She said adrian if donald trump starts to get in your way sue him [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1127.4199999999998s)]
*  So I am suing him. I am suing the mayoral administration and donald trump's ice [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1134.06s)]
*  We will continue to protect immigrants when I am mayor just like I am protecting them as the leader of the city council [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1139.6599999999999s)]
*  We will make sure that donald trump's ice obeys the law. We are a sanctuary city [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1145.82s)]
*  I am here to protect that in the city council and when I am mayor I will continue to know she got more emotion than kamala [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1151.1799999999998s)]
*  She has more passion than kamala [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1157.5s)]
*  But if the president says the mayor has no say [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1162.78s)]
*  Which seems to be the case because he did deploy the marines and the national guard [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1166.86s)]
*  What would you do? What could you do? Let me tell you about how the mayor could have a say last thursday [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1172.0600000000002s)]
*  And again this morning I went down to the federal building to observe immigration court and then accompany immigrants [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1176.8600000000001s)]
*  Out past ice agents so they could get out of the federal building and back to their families one was a couple with [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1183.8200000000002s)]
*  Kids in our city school system. They were worried. They weren't going to see them again [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1190.78s)]
*  So I stand up to believe I don't back down from a fight and I will make clear that we're going to protect the 40 [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1195.3400000000001s)]
*  Percent of new yorkers not our immigrants and we're going to keep them safe and we're going to keep new york city safe [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1202.22s)]
*  You can de-escalate conflict what trump wants is to strike fear and escalate conflict [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1208.6200000000001s)]
*  We're going to make clear we stand up for immigrant new yorkers and we de-escalate and keep the peace [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1214.54s)]
*  I do want to tell you though about some immigrant new yorkers that andrew cuomo screwed when he was governor and we're defending in my office [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1219.58s)]
*  A couple of hundred immigrant subway cleaners who he made clean the subway cars [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1226.06s)]
*  But cheated out of the prevailing wages and health care that they were due [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1230.78s)]
*  We're fighting right now to get it back. I stand up to bullies and i'll stand up to donald trump. Mr. Cuomo you were [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1235.18s)]
*  You remain safe [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1240.86s)]
*  We [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1243.74s)]
*  We may not be able to do this every time all night, but you were named so you get a brief response [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1244.54s)]
*  Yeah, um, I don't know what mr. Lander is talking about the mta [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1250.62s)]
*  Contracted for cleaning services. I assume that's what he's talking about [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1256.1999999999998s)]
*  Uh, the mta goes through a rigorous contracting process. They should never have hired illegal immigrants if it is true [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1261.02s)]
*  uh, but obviously I [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1269.8999999999999s)]
*  Obviously I had nothing to do with them hiring. I'm sorry. Is that what you said? What did you call them? [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1272.2199999999998s)]
*  If anyone was undocumented or they didn't pay the proper [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1277.1799999999998s)]
*  Wages oh, they're laughing at him in the room [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1281.4199999999998s)]
*  Paid them the proper wages you cheated them out of the prevailing wages. They were due and the health care [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1284.3799999999999s)]
*  They were I didn't contract with them at all [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1289.02s)]
*  the mta [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1292.62s)]
*  Who appoints the chair of the mta? [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1294.6000000000001s)]
*  Oh, I see. So every contract that the mta contracts you want me to be held responsible this one. Yes, because [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1296.8400000000001s)]
*  Workers got cheated out of two and a half million dollars and their health care and the orders bad luck [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1304.1200000000001s)]
*  Boomers hate when someone just says ah, it's not my responsibility [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1310.52s)]
*  Six billion dollars per year. They have multiple what if you want to be mayor then jackass if you're not going to be responsible [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1315.64s)]
*  Of new york who i'm sure he's almost okay brad [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1322.1999999999998s)]
*  Okay, brad, I take it back. He was dork maxing but he's now cooking workers under city contracts, but um, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1326.76s)]
*  nerds rise up trump and mr [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1332.52s)]
*  Stringer you can reply to that if you want but my moving on question is his administration has made deep cuts [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1334.76s)]
*  To some programs that directly fund services for new yorkers a listener to my radio show asks [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1342.6s)]
*  How do you propose addressing funding shortfalls for critical services or which programs will you prioritize above others? [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1348.6s)]
*  assuming you can't make for all the funding gaps make up for all the funding gaps and [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1356.36s)]
*  Please tell everybody how you think your approach would be better than the other candidates sure sure brad [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1361.08s)]
*  Well, look I was in trump one when I was a city controller and during that time period [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1365.7199999999998s)]
*  I didn't let him get this city down [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1370.36s)]
*  During my time I managed to divest four billion dollars from fossil fuels controller [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1373.08s)]
*  I divested from gun manufacturers. I divested from private prisons [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1377.0800000000002s)]
*  I put the line in the sand with that guy and I will do the same as mayor [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1380.52s)]
*  Look when you grow up in washington tights [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1384.68s)]
*  Everything comes your way and you understand the only way to deal with is a bully is to draw the line early and fight back [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1386.76s)]
*  So here's specifically what i'm going to do first as mayor [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1392.76s)]
*  We're going to establish a very very rainy day fund [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1395.88s)]
*  We need to get 500 million dollars from the state and 500 million dollars from the city so that we can continue to replenish the money [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1398.04s)]
*  That donald trump is taking from us 80 million dollars is taken in the dead of night [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1404.92s)]
*  We need to keep the social safety net alive until hakim jeffries becomes the speaker and we can dismantle the trump organization [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1409.0800000000002s)]
*  Just one yeah the ribbon looks just to straighten out the two of them [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1415.4s)]
*  Brought the prevailing case with the mta on those workers [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1419.3200000000002s)]
*  And I believe very strongly then that we have to make sure that we pay wages so people can live and stay in new york [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1422.44s)]
*  And that's why I did it. Mr. Myer is saying [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1428.2s)]
*  Mr. Myer is saying question about dealing with the defunding of the city [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1431.16s)]
*  Yeah, first, let me put my lawyer hat on for a second what donald trump is doing right now is flat out unconstitutional [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1435.32s)]
*  And we got to say that very clearly because they are counting on the chaos [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1442.04s)]
*  Being normal they're counting on us being relaxed about this approach because we see it in the headlines every day [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1447.56s)]
*  It is flat out unconstitutional and we should not as a city hesitate whatsoever [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1452.92s)]
*  To bring it to him when he's coming after our folks in this city [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1458.38s)]
*  So look, I want to hire 50 more lawyers to our law department so we can go on the offensive [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1461.66s)]
*  And the best way for us to be independent of the trump cuts is to expand our tax base [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1466.14s)]
*  That is why I want to deliver a million homes over the next 10 years [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1471.42s)]
*  That's why I want to extend pre-k and 3k to 6 pm [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1474.46s)]
*  It is why I want universal after school for everyone [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1477.5s)]
*  This has to be a city where you can raise a family where people can make the choice to stay here [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1479.74s)]
*  When they can spend their money on our local economy [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1484.46s)]
*  We can create 18 billion dollars over the next 10 years if we create a one million homes over the next decade [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1486.78s)]
*  That is what I plan to do and I plan to go on offense every single time this bully comes after my city [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1493.02s)]
*  Mr. Chilson, you'll get the last word on this [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1501.9s)]
*  People are talking about standing up to president trump [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1504.8600000000001s)]
*  Can it ever be smart in your opinion to hold your tongue about your worst opinions of him? [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1507.42s)]
*  So that new york could possibly get better treatment or would that not be effective? [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1513.26s)]
*  Yes, possibly. Um, we have there's a grim anniversary coming up on tuesday [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1518.1399999999999s)]
*  It is the 10 year anniversary of trump coming down that escalator [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1522.2199999999998s)]
*  Uh spewing hatred and xenophobia [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1525.74s)]
*  Him tooth and nail every day of those 10 years [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1529.02s)]
*  uh that said [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1531.82s)]
*  um, he is a childish bully [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1533.26s)]
*  and uh getting into a twitter war with him, uh needlessly [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1536.86s)]
*  Uh would hurt our city. I think uh, he tweets a lot of crazy stuff and uh, most of the time if you simply ignore it [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1540.94s)]
*  He uh moves on to his uh, his next childish [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1548.46s)]
*  foolishness so uh to your question, uh, I will fight donald trump [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1552.76s)]
*  As mayor stand up to him sue him if necessary [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1558.54s)]
*  But my job is to serve the people of new york and that sometimes involves, uh, not provoking [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1562.22s)]
*  You guys are booing the guy with the biggest ribbon a community of anti-semites clearly 10 of our city budget [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1567.66s)]
*  The adl was right. The adl was right. Ethan Klein was right. I've manifested a community of 80s. I might you are [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1573.42s)]
*  Not supposed to boo the candidate with the biggest ribbon [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1579.5s)]
*  Who says to ignore donald trump just ignore him? It's fine elected to any office [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1582.38s)]
*  So and then if we consider age one of you would be if elected the oldest person ever to be sworn in as mayor [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1586.6200000000001s)]
*  While another would be the youngest mayor to take office in more than 100 years [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1593.18s)]
*  So let me start with you. Mr. Mom. Donny [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1597.74s)]
*  What do you say to critics who think that a 33 year old assemblyman who's only been in office four years? [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1599.42s)]
*  Needs more experience before becoming my mistake. I didn't realize you guys were saying you're booing him because you want a bigger ribbon [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1605.1s)]
*  Judge me by the campaign that I am running the campaign [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1611.02s)]
*  We began with about two full-time employees polling at one percent [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1613.5s)]
*  That has now grown to be one where we manage over 36,000 volunteers that have knocked on nearly a million doors [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1617.34s)]
*  And ultimately what I will deliver to new york city is what i've been delivering in this race [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1623.58s)]
*  Innovation and competence and I will do so by hiring the best and the brightest because for too long [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1627.8s)]
*  We've had an understanding of leadership where you simply want to replicate [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1633.26s)]
*  Each one of your ideas and hire the people who will be quickest to say yes to whatever you say to them [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1636.9399999999998s)]
*  I will instead hire the people who have the track records the excellence the fluency and it has been a pleasure [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1641.82s)]
*  To meet with incredible officials like maria torres springer like patrick gaspard like steve banks like amit baga [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1647.1s)]
*  So many who have delivered that public service and that public excellence in this city [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1652.54s)]
*  And that is what I would be doing as the next mayor of this city of new york. Mr. Myree a similar question [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1657.1s)]
*  What would you say to new yorkers concern that your legislative record? [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1662.3799999999999s)]
*  However lengthy is not the same as running an organization of 300 000 employees [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1665.34s)]
*  Listen, I think new yorkers want a mayor that is going to deliver results for them and to do it when it is difficult to achieve [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1670.1399999999999s)]
*  I've passed over 60 bills that have become the law, but when I ran for state senate back in 2018 albany was dysfunctional [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1676.62s)]
*  Some rogue democrats propped up by andrew cuomo prevented so many legislation that would help everyday new yorkers [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1684.46s)]
*  Whether it was protection for tenants whether it was reproductive health whether it was climate legislation [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1690.94s)]
*  Whether it was your right to be safe in your neighborhood and on day one in the state senate [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1696.3799999999999s)]
*  I passed something called early voting which all of us are going to participate in on this saturday [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1701.26s)]
*  So I am about the results and about the work. I have built coalition. I have listened to stakeholders [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1706.06s)]
*  I've done really difficult things [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1712.1399999999999s)]
*  That is the job of the mayor to get everyone at the table and to achieve something that people said was impossible [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1713.8999999999999s)]
*  I've been in the business of delivering for the people of my district [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1719.82s)]
*  I look forward to doing the same thing for the people of new york city [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1723.1799999999998s)]
*  Cuomo if elected you'd be the oldest person ever sworn in as mayor [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1726.94s)]
*  Um, if you serve two full terms, you'd be 76 years old upon leaving office [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1731.34s)]
*  Is somebody in their 70s the ideal age for holding the second artist job in america? [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1735.82s)]
*  Let's do let's do one term at a time if we can [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1740.3799999999999s)]
*  uh [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1743.74s)]
*  I think you raise a very important point experience matters [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1745.1s)]
*  And I think inexperience is dangerous in this case. Mr. Mondami has had a staff of five people [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1749.02s)]
*  You're now going to run a staff of 300 000. He never says his last name right by the way [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1755.82s)]
*  He's never dealt with the city council. He's never dealt with the congress. He's never dealt with the state legislature [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1760.3s)]
*  He's never negotiated with the union. He's never built anything [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1765.2s)]

*  He's never done any of the essentials and now you have donald trump on top of all of that [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1774.96s)]
*  And he's never dealt with what I think is the greatest national threat that we face [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1780.8799999999999s)]
*  Uh in this president to put a person in this seat at that at this time [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1786.32s)]
*  With no experience is reckless and dangerous [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1793.3600000000001s)]
*  Uh to mr lander in his experience remember this was the fiscal watchdog under the eric adams administration [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1797.7600000000002s)]
*  Which was like the bookkeeper at tamany hall [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1804.8000000000002s)]

*  I have never hounded the 13 women who credibly accused me of sexual harassment [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1824.6399999999999s)]
*  I have never sued for their gynecological records and I have never done those things because I am not you [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1828.96s)]
*  Mr. Cuomo and furthermore the name is mom. Donny m-a-m [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1835.28s)]

*  Let mr lander speak and then you can respond to both just because those women deserve it. I'm italian. It's my culture if you choose [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1853.2s)]

*  He tried to put a 432 million dollar no bid crony contract, uh, and we audited it and we got it canceled [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1865.92s)]
*  We have done it time and time again [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1873.8400000000001s)]
*  Uh andrew knows a lot about corruption. That's part of the experience he had he created a corruption commission [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1876.1599999999999s)]
*  And then killed it as soon as it got too close to him [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1881.9199999999998s)]
*  But his senior aides had to resign in corruption disgrace and let's be clear. He has experience but [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1884.6399999999999s)]
*  Leadership is not inviting 25 year old young women into your office as he admitted he did [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1891.34s)]
*  And then asking them about their intimate life and whether they would date older men [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1897.1999999999998s)]
*  I lead by building the best teams not through sexual harassment corruption and disgrace [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1901.52s)]
*  Mr. Cromwell [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1907.84s)]
*  Uh, mr. Mondami's right, he's never done anything period mom. This is a man [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1912.8799999999999s)]
*  This is say the name right. This is a man who has done nothing [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1918.08s)]
*  He's accomplished nothing [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1922.8s)]
*  Three bills are all he paid. He's full of immigrants worst [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1925.36s)]
*  Attendance record in the new york state city full of immigrants. They've all fucking experienced a guy like andrew cuomo [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1930.0800000000002s)]
*  He has fucking up their name deliberately [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1936.72s)]
*  And now he thinks he's going to be ready to be mayor of the city of new york [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1939.2s)]
*  It is laughable. It is laughable and it is dangerous [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1943.8400000000001s)]
*  I want I want I want really quick and then we're gonna look out into the crowd and look at richard chow [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1948.4s)]
*  Who lost his brother to suicide because of the taxi driver debt crisis? [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1953.2s)]
*  I went with mr. Chow over many many months organizing to push this very city to finally [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1958.08s)]
*  Reckon with its complicity in that and we won [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1964.72s)]
*  450 million dollars in debt relief and I want you to look at him and tell him that that's nothing. Okay, let's um [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1967.74s)]
*  Oh, he used oh personal anecdote. Oh my god [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1975.6s)]
*  Oh my god, he had a crowd placement personal anecdote [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1979.92s)]
*  Tell what's really going on here. So truth be told experience matters [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1983.44s)]
*  And andrew cuomo has experience [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1988.08s)]
*  I know that he does [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1990.08s)]
*  But vision matters [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1993.44s)]
*  And mandami said it right, right? [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1995.6s)]
*  mandani almost there. Okay, i'm getting there almost there, but [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=1998.0s)]
*  You have the vision and you have articulated it during the campaign [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2002.16s)]
*  The problem the problem is we need somebody who can do both [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2005.68s)]
*  And my experience and my vision when you combine it is the third [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2011.04s)]
*  Very good. Very good. We cannot look we cannot have a mayoralty on training wheels [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2018.0s)]
*  But we also have to have a mayor who's willing to go to town hall meetings to meet where the voters where they are [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2022.8s)]
*  And that hasn't happened with the experience candidate every job i've had state legislator [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2029.04s)]
*  I introduced rules reform in the assembly and got it passed as manhattan borough president [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2034.16s)]
*  I actually built affordable housing. I didn't do one or two rezoning [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2037.68s)]
*  I did that as my life's work and made a difference as controller. I built the best controller's office [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2040.72s)]
*  This is where mamdani is supposed to turn around this is where zoran is supposed to turn around and basically be like listen experience [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2046.96s)]
*  Experience is negligible because andrew cuomo's entire experience amounts to new yorkers [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2054.46s)]
*  Experiencing failure and a quality of life diminishing we don't want that. That's why i'm running [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2061.84s)]
*  We we need we need people who are dynamic. We need candidates who are younger. We need candidates who are actually [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2068.1600000000003s)]
*  Experienced with the life experience of what it's like to be [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2074.94s)]
*  Working poor in this city currently doing this work not someone who comes from [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2079.1200000000003s)]
*  a a political dynasty [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2084.56s)]
*  That has cursed the new york state and new york city [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2086.88s)]
*  For their entire lives and is directly responsible for all the pain new yorkers feel in this affordability crisis [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2090.8s)]
*  as one that has seen 120 000 units of affordable housing [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2097.52s)]
*  Coming up in the city as one who has championed the largest victory for affordable housing in a generation [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2102.7200000000003s)]
*  As one that is already doing this work as one that has taken private [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2110.2400000000002s)]
*  Skills from the private sector and management [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2115.04s)]
*  I have trained people that will make more money than I will ever make in a lifetime [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2117.76s)]
*  And bringing those skills with me into the public sector into the new york city council now leading a a body of 50 [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2122.32s)]
*  Me council members as the one with the experience ready to go to work tomorrow because where I work is where everyone else on this [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2130.32s)]
*  On this stage aspires to work in city hall in adrian adams new york [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2137.92s)]
*  Okay [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2142.6400000000003s)]
*  I have a question for you. Mr [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2144.7200000000003s)]
*  Tilson related to this discussion you have frequently said on the campaign trail that quote career [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2146.56s)]
*  Politicians have caused many of the city's problems or made them worse. You said tonight in fact that this is no time for amateur hour [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2151.6600000000003s)]
*  Explain why a lack of experience running a city agency would make you a better manager than some of your rivals here [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2159.04s)]
*  Um, I actually view not being a politician as a feature not a bug [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2166.0s)]
*  It is possible to hire [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2170.1600000000003s)]
*  People into administration, of course who have the experience of running a big bureaucracy [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2171.92s)]
*  I would point to mike bloomberg as my inspiration when I decided to run for mayor [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2178.08s)]
*  He had never held elected office before I think he was one of our greatest mayors [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2182.7200000000003s)]
*  He steered us through the global financial crisis [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2186.8799999999997s)]
*  And I believe that having someone like him who I saw was independent of all the special interests [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2189.92s)]
*  Who in a low turnout offseason primary like what we're having right now [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2196.64s)]
*  Like this guy is for no one [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2202.0s)]
*  I can't in good conscience believe that there are people out here that look at what this guy has the offer and goes [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2205.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that's my guy. I really want like a fucking soulless technocrat [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2212.16s)]
*  Is independent of that VC guy a hedge fund guy to run the city. That's really going to fix the problems [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2216.8799999999997s)]
*  office and [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2223.44s)]
*  Well, at least got the fattest ribbon, you know, which I think is more relevant to managing one of the world's largest bureaucracies [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2224.72s)]
*  Okay [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2230.72s)]
*  Thank you candidates [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2231.8399999999997s)]
*  It's also funny because like when you ask their top concerns one of the biggest issues is always affordability [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2234.48s)]
*  Particularly the high cost of housing millions of new yorkers and rent stabilized apartments are currently awaiting a final ruling from the [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2239.92s)]
*  rent guidelines board about how much they could pay more each month in rent [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2246.48s)]
*  But first we'll get to a crucial question about the production of housing [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2250.88s)]
*  We want you the candidates to address new yorkers with your top proposal to ease the housing crunch and i'll start with you. Mr [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2255.52s)]
*  Myri [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2261.76s)]
*  We know you've been vocal about a plan to build and preserve one million units of housing you mentioned earlier [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2262.64s)]
*  Is that a realistic possibility given the current dynamics in the city? Uh, let me tell you what's real katie [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2267.68s)]
*  People are leaving the city because they can't afford to stay here. They can't afford the rent home [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2274.32s)]
*  Like me and my wife who were looking to put down roots in the same neighborhood we grew up in [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2280.08s)]
*  People are struggling and we've had leaders of the past that have put their solutions forward and things have only gotten worse [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2284.48s)]
*  So yes, one million homes over the next 10 years because we can't keep nibbling around the edges [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2292.08s)]
*  That is the only way we're actually going to bring down the cost of housing and listen [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2297.84s)]
*  Is it going to be challenging? Of course, it's going to be challenging but anything worth anything [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2301.52s)]
*  Is going to be hard to do [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2306.7200000000003s)]
*  We built the empire state building in 13 months and we did it 100 years ago [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2308.5600000000004s)]
*  Come on already, of course, we can do a million homes. I want to change our public land to be affordable housing [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2313.76s)]
*  I want to convert our industrial areas to residential. We have commercial real estate space that is laying vacant that can be converted as well [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2320.32s)]
*  Not bad opportunities to revitalize nisha we got to be bold in this moment [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2327.6800000000003s)]
*  But we need the leadership and the courage to get it done and that's what i'm going to do [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2332.0s)]
*  Thank you [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2336.5600000000004s)]
*  Mr. Stringer [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2338.4s)]
*  Your housing model your housing plan is to model a highly successful plan from the 1950s. You call it michellama 2.0 [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2340.0800000000004s)]
*  It sounds ideal, but how would you pay for this? [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2347.28s)]
*  expansive plan [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2350.38s)]

*  See, it's not just about building housing [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2390.64s)]
*  The second question or the question that I care passionately about is who are we building housing for? [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2392.96s)]
*  We got to build more housing two three-bedroom apartments for families so that after the second kid they don't leave they stay here [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2397.8399999999997s)]

*  Practice in the world [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2408.8799999999997s)]
*  We got to build more of that housing integrated housing because the people who moved into those buildings [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2410.16s)]
*  You know what they did. They didn't just exist in those apartments [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2414.72s)]
*  They build communities schools and daycare centers, and this is a promise I can keep [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2418.0s)]
*  While i'm alive while i'm mayor and we'll see what happens going forward, but let's do that immediately on day one when i'm there [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2423.44s)]
*  Thank you [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2430.0s)]
*  Mr. Lander as mayor you declare a housing emergency which could help you build half a million homes [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2431.36s)]
*  Including on city-owned golf courses [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2437.2799999999997s)]

*  So the new york times opinion panel today said I was the best choice for mayor because I combine [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2442.7200000000003s)]
*  Clear and bold plans and a real track record of delivering that is especially true on housing [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2448.0s)]
*  In the neighborhood around the goanis canal when I was council member, I organized the community to support redevelopment [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2454.2400000000002s)]
*  More housing more affordable housing is going up there than anywhere else in the city and the community supporting it because [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2460.96s)]

*  As controller I saved the 35 000 rent stabilized units that were put at risk when signature bank failed [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2476.3199999999997s)]
*  By investing to buy the mortgages on them. I know how to do this. I have a detailed plan for getting [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2482.96s)]
*  500,000 units built that's around the inter borough express where we've got new opportunities for transit-oriented development [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2489.74s)]
*  And we can build great new neighborhoods on four of the city's 12 golf courses because people will be excited about courtyards for families [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2496.7400000000002s)]

*  Organization, what would you say to voters who wonder if all that experience? [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2521.28s)]
*  Might end up being in the end the wrong experience since after decades of work [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2525.2999999999997s)]
*  We've ended up in a housing emergency here in the city [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2530.58s)]
*  I would say um, errol. I would say look at that's what I mean [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2533.62s)]
*  That's why you can use experience against Cuomo like this. Everyone has a plan. They had a plan to build la guadia [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2537.94s)]
*  Airport nobody shouldn't be coming but that shouldn't be coming from them fucking moderators [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2543.54s)]
*  You should be coming from zoran station, but nobody could do it until I did it [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2546.98s)]
*  They had a plan to finish the second avenue subway, but nobody could do it until I could do it [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2549.86s)]
*  Now we have plans to build affordable housing and we do need [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2554.26s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of units of affordable housing. There's no doubt, but we're going to need a different model [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2558.8s)]
*  The city hpd does not work to create this volume [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2564.26s)]
*  The state housing program does not work to create this volume [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2568.34s)]
*  We're going to have to accelerate the ulr program and then we're going to have to open every option available [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2572.02s)]
*  NYCHA units office to residential conversion every city owned piece of property [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2578.58s)]
*  We have to look at air rights. How do we maximize it? We are going to have to have a full on [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2584.18s)]
*  Assault to build affordable housing and yes, it's one thing to have a plan [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2591.92s)]
*  It's another thing to have the ability to do it and that's where new york city has fallen down [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2598.5s)]
*  Time and time again [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2604.7400000000002s)]
*  Not the managerial ability to complete a plan [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2606.7400000000002s)]
*  Miss adams [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2611.46s)]
*  You mentioned the recent city of yes rezoning that you were instrumental in helping to pass [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2612.98s)]
*  It's supposed to create tens of thousands of units of housing [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2618.0200000000004s)]
*  But the experience of past rezoning like the one in downtown brooklyn [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2621.6200000000003s)]
*  Suggests that it can take as long as 10 years or longer for rezoning to result in actual construction [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2625.6200000000003s)]
*  If you're elected mayor, what would be your plan to get units built more quickly than that? [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2631.78s)]
*  We're going to build it faster and we're on by the way [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2636.7400000000002s)]
*  Build anything like the scale that we're talking about. I said it's the opposite of his plan because his plan is to spend 100 billion [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2640.1s)]
*  City dollars [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2648.26s)]
*  Uh to the counter. This is so simple. It's like oh [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2649.38s)]
*  If the private sector was supposed to help new yorkers it would have by now [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2652.7400000000002s)]
*  That what you're describing is the past 30 years of [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2656.5s)]
*  Of private public partnership [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2660.5s)]
*  And I think every new yorker that doesn't make 20 million dollars a year like you [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2663.38s)]
*  Recognizes a very different reality [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2668.64s)]
*  Than someone who was out of touch such as yourself [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2670.98s)]
*  Experiences by 15 percent in three years and rents dropped by 20 percent. I don't just want to stabilize rent [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2674.42s)]
*  I think we can drop rents in this city. Uh, that's the objective [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2679.38s)]
*  But right now it's outrageous that businesses and real estate developers have to hire [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2683.06s)]
*  Expeditors to deal with the city bureaucracy. So it's a it's a much bigger problem and the mayor controls [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2687.4399999999996s)]
*  Uh most uh or all of this [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2692.98s)]
*  Thank you. Mr. Mom down [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2695.54s)]
*  I met a grandmother in a senior center in brownsville and she came up to me and told me that she'd been on a waiting list [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2700.18s)]
*  For seven years for senior housing and that she wasn't sure if she was going to be able to stay in the city any longer [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2706.66s)]
*  The reason that my campaign is committing to building 200 000 truly affordable homes is because if we don't [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2712.82s)]
*  We will lose the very new yorkers who built this city and we will lose them [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2719.94s)]
*  Unless we rapidly scale up the programs we already have programs in hpd like sarah senior affordable rental apartments [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2723.6200000000003s)]
*  Ella extremely low level affordability the very kind of programs that are built for the new yorkers who are being priced out of the market [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2730.6600000000003s)]
*  And we do this while also ensuring that it is easier to build even for the private sector [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2737.3s)]
*  We end the requirement to build parking we end this piecemeal approach that we've taken instead of having a city-wide [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2742.1s)]
*  Comprehensive planning approach these are the kinds of ways in which we can actually ensure that we start to build more [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2748.7200000000003s)]
*  Than four houses per a thousand people that we actually start to get up to jersey city and tokyo and build the housing [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2754.5s)]
*  That's necessary in the city to finish this round [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2759.38s)]
*  By a show of hands I will translate for the radio audience [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2763.14s)]

*  We've had five district attorneys democrat republicans upstate downstate. They've all looked at them [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2914.26s)]
*  Nothing has come of them whatsoever. There has been one civil case that's been resolved. I was dropped [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2920.98s)]
*  from the case [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2928.02s)]

*  Do any other candidates want to chime in? [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2941.04s)]
*  You admitted at the time that you called a 25 year old staffer into your office and [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2946.16s)]
*  Asked her questions about whether she'd had older partners and whether she was available and intimated that you were looking for a partner [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2951.68s)]

*  We're here with all these all these cuny students many of them young women. I went to the city college commencement [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2966.7400000000002s)]

*  There are there are a majority of women who don't give a shit [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2992.52s)]
*  And also trump too obviously [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=2998.4399999999996s)]
*  I never said that I never said that and by the way that has been totally [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3001.3999999999996s)]
*  Disproven obviously men don't give a shit at all even though ironically enough white men are the only demographic [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3007.2s)]
*  That's more pros or on than pro-komo, but the report was issued the DA's looked at it [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3013.58s)]
*  They all disagree with you. I was dropped from the case [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3019.42s)]
*  So that those are the fact the Biden Justice Department and the Attorney General of the state of New York [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3022.98s)]
*  And again, it was reported that you admitted at the time [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3029.2999999999997s)]
*  No, I didn't was a mistake to call a 25 year old into your office. Let's can check the record [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3031.86s)]
*  If he worked for you you would [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3038.5s)]
*  Just [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3044.2599999999998s)]
*  General's report [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3048.62s)]
*  Was determined by a court to be hearsay and not a finding at all. I [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3050.2599999999998s)]
*  Understand mr. Lander is just a part of the women [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3057.58s)]
*  You of sexual harassment calling hearsay the district attorneys looked at all those complaints. Okay, and not a single [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3061.74s)]
*  Circles, let's let's move on [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3070.1s)]
*  The fact yes, this is disqualifying and the man resigned should be obvious [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3072.6s)]
*  The problem is we do not get to address the issues that New Yorkers care about [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3078.88s)]
*  We're done with this topic we're gonna move on to the next one candidates [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3087.68s)]
*  Let's talk about quality of life concerns about of disorder and public safety [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3090.96s)]
*  The number of complaints about disorderly conduct in New York City nearly have nearly tripled compared to the pre-pandemic year of [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3095.64s)]
*  2018 [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3102.24s)]
*  Arrest for disorderly conduct have risen significantly [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3103.3199999999997s)]
*  But New Yorkers still say they are less satisfied about their quality of life than in the past. So we're gonna start with you. Mr. Lander [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3106.64s)]
*  Do you want the NYPD to address quality of life violations? [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3113.64s)]
*  Or is there some other way to do it and how would you address concerns about quality of life without violating? [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3117.12s)]
*  constitutional rights or opening the door to [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3123.8399999999997s)]
*  Accusations of illegal profiling as mayor my number one priority will be to end street homelessness [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3126.68s)]
*  For people with serious mental illness when I talk to people about what's influencing their quality of life [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3132.56s)]
*  What would they like changed they would like to be able to get on the subway and feel safer last week [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3137.7999999999997s)]
*  I talked about a friend whose middle school sound by a mentally ill homeless person [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3143.68s)]
*  But we don't have to be a city where a couple thousand of our mentally ill neighbors [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3149.04s)]
*  Sleep on subway platforms and the sidewalks and stoops of our buildings [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3153.62s)]
*  And yes, of course NYPD have a role to play in keeping neighborhoods safe getting guns off the street [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3158.26s)]
*  But no amount of policing is gonna connect a homeless mentally ill person to the housing and services that they actually need [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3164.9s)]
*  The plan that will is called housing first. It's working in Houston and Denver and salt guys. He's not [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3172.54s)]
*  Don't don't get caught up in the language. He's not wrong [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3179.26s)]
*  Homelessness for people with serious mental illness and he wants to do housing first like he's dork maxing, but he's right [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3183.48s)]
*  Like what do you what are we doing here your direct question which is the issue of quality of life [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3193.42s)]
*  The goal is to get people to care that they need [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3198.42s)]
*  the starting point for that is [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3201.46s)]
*  Housing first policies with trash. They don't want to live with broken sidewalks [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3204.46s)]
*  They don't want a 3-1-1 system that can't resolve the basic day-to-day issues that New Yorkers face [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3208.68s)]
*  We've gotten away from that kind of work [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3215.7s)]
*  You know swagger to me is different than swagger at City Hall today swagger means I feel satisfied [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3218.24s)]
*  When we help somebody get the services we need how I'm gonna do it specifically [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3224.5s)]
*  We've got to have a deputy the fact you have to hurt your followers and then they comment. Yeah, he's right [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3229.2s)]
*  He's dead or maybe there's a lot of people in here and some people disagree with me [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3233.24s)]
*  For the day-to-day running of the city and resolving complaints and issues [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3237.9s)]
*  We need to know about that. We need to look at the data at 3-1-1. We need to do the follow-ups [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3241.6600000000003s)]
*  I'm gonna be the mayor. You don't think about anything [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3246.88s)]
*  You're fucking moron comes to town hall meetings and communities just like I did is controller [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3248.7400000000002s)]
*  Well, my sleeves up go in front of hundreds of people and say let me have it. What do you want? [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3252.78s)]
*  What's going on and I will resolve a complaint to 24 hours [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3257.86s)]
*  That's the kind of mayor that we need in this city to keep people here and to make sure that we become the beacon [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3261.5s)]
*  Of the greatest city of the world. Okay, mr. Mondani [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3267.78s)]
*  You know when I speak to New Yorkers across the five boroughs what I hear time and time again are these very kinds of complaints [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3272.66s)]
*  complaints around [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3279.26s)]
*  The cleanliness of our streets complaints around whether the parks that they love can actually be maintained and so many of them come back [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3281.0s)]
*  To a mayoral administration that has underfunded city agencies time and time again [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3287.7s)]
*  Literally requesting to take garbage cans off of sidewalks. That's what we have had for the last four years [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3293.2200000000003s)]
*  I'm proud to have been endorsed by DC 37 [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3297.9s)]
*  The single largest labor union representing municipal workers in this city the people who run this city [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3302.88s)]
*  Trust me to lead this city and what I will do is fully fund each one of those agencies [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3307.5s)]
*  To ensure that we are not just providing public service [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3311.78s)]
*  We're providing public excellence so that each and every New Yorker is five that they deserve living in the city [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3314.66s)]
*  Okay, and so mr. Myrie really in a lot of ways what I'm getting at is that [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3319.58s)]
*  The city government and a lot of voters frankly will reflexively reach for the NYPD as the best tool to handle what they perceive [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3324.42s)]
*  As disorder which some people say is kind of a stepping stone towards crime or in some ways a precursor to it [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3332.5s)]
*  What's your take on that and how would you handle it? Yeah, let me first say sky [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3338.96s)]
*  You got some sneakers on today, so I don't want you to discount yourself. Oh my god [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3342.96s)]
*  So let me say this let me say this look I walk the streets [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3349.72s)]
*  I take the subways just like you do and part of the reason that people are frustrated with politics is because you walk the streets [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3352.58s)]
*  You take the subways and then you listen to folks on this stage and it's completely divorced from your reality [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3358.16s)]
*  Here's what I want to do [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3363.28s)]
*  I think we need police and clinician teams in our subways in our streets 24 7 to get people on [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3364.48s)]
*  Oh [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3370.7599999999998s)]
*  New Yorkers are compassionate. No, that's [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3371.7599999999998s)]
*  People are actually getting that help [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3375.08s)]
*  So I want stabilization centers in every borough so that we can deliver that help public safety requires us to do two things [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3376.96s)]
*  We understand that police officers are necessary, but we also have to invest in the things [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3384.12s)]
*  We know prevent crime and disorder in the first place [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3389.04s)]
*  That's why I want fifty thousand more summer youth jobs so that it is universal [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3391.62s)]
*  We have no young person on a waiting list [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3396.0s)]
*  Waiting list stop telling our kids what not to do without giving them something to do [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3398.52s)]
*  I want universal after school as well so that we can have a safe place to be and have our families have a place where [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3402.26s)]
*  Their children can stay okay [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3407.88s)]
*  Yes to answer your question directly about enforcing more quality of life issues [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3414.12s)]
*  For example, I ride my bike almost every day in the city [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3419.2s)]
*  The ebikes are fast and dangerous and we're riding up on the sidewalks blowing through red lights and cops started enforcing it [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3422.0s)]
*  And I can tell you being out there every day. They're now obeying the law [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3429.84s)]
*  That is the kind of thing that contributes to the feeling of lack of safety [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3433.12s)]
*  Almost winning in most polls or on is winning in one what I would not do [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3439.52s)]
*  But not by almost not winning by wide margin corrupt by threatening to defund and dismantle them as Zoran has done [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3443.24s)]
*  And we are at a 34 year low in the number of police officers [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3450.18s)]
*  There's only one candidate on this stage him who has not said that he would try and build that number back up [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3453.42s)]
*  So I think his Department of Community Safety which he talks about is just backdoor code word for continue to [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3459.18s)]
*  Defund the police they are demoralized. They're understaffed [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3466.8599999999997s)]
*  And no another car [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3470.66s)]
*  Revolving door where an officer at the Midtown North Precinct very close to here actually told me [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3473.2999999999997s)]
*  She is still filling out the paperwork for most of her arrest and the criminals back out onto the street before she's finished [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3478.7s)]
*  Did you want to respond? I? [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3485.3799999999997s)]
*  Want to say it very clearly [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3489.7799999999997s)]
*  Because both mr [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3491.7799999999997s)]
*  Tillson and Andrew Cuomo's Republican billionaire donors have been lying about me on our television screens and right now I [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3492.98s)]
*  Will not defund the police [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3500.2999999999997s)]
*  I will work with the police because I believe the police have a critical role to play in creating public service public safety and [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3501.74s)]
*  Fundamentally when I put together our proposal for the Department of Community Safety [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3508.9s)]
*  It was built upon the many conversations [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3513.0200000000004s)]
*  I had with rank-and-file officers who had told me that they signed up to join the department to take on serious crimes [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3516.0200000000004s)]
*  And yet what they were being asked to do is play the roles of mental health professionals and social workers [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3522.5400000000004s)]
*  And that is part of the reason why 65% of crimes in the first quarter of this year are still not solved [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3527.46s)]
*  We need to ensure police can focus on those crimes [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3533.78s)]
*  And we have mental professionals and social workers to address and tackle and resolve the mental health crisis [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3536.8599999999997s)]
*  Whitney did you not talk about my police retention plan or you didn't come on Scott? [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3550.54s)]
*  Miss Adams, I want to bring in the conversation because you were at City Hall when the the [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3556.14s)]
*  Funding question came up that has been interpreted by some as defund the police [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3562.78s)]
*  What was happening then in in that particular session with that particular proposal? [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3567.1s)]
*  and if you're elected what would you do about this question of where and when and if [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3572.34s)]
*  The police get involved in quality of life policing. Thank you for asking the clarifying question. Errol very much [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3577.66s)]
*  The FY 2021 budget season was a very very tough season for the New York City Council [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3584.38s)]
*  And quite frankly for the mayoral administration as well [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3590.38s)]
*  We were still masked up in the pandemic and New York City was very very [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3593.46s)]
*  Underfunded as a city we were looking towards going in the hole if you will [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3599.02s)]
*  So several city agencies had to take a haircut [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3603.7000000000003s)]
*  The NYPD was one of those agencies as well were many many city agencies heck the New York City Council [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3607.06s)]
*  We had to take a haircut. So there was funding [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3613.26s)]
*  Reallocation that happened across the board for New York City because of the pandemic [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3617.06s)]
*  So I mean services were cut many folks out there real realize that some of park services were cut and other services were cut as well [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3621.62s)]
*  Unfortunately, so that was the climate that we were in pandemic season as mayor though [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3629.74s)]
*  I know that New York City is fiscally found [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3635.2999999999997s)]
*  Our issue right now is going to be Trump Trump proofing the New York City [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3638.7799999999997s)]
*  Trump proofing New York City [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3644.2200000000003s)]
*  Which I am doing right now as one who is negotiating the fourth New York City budget something that no one else on this stage can say and [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3645.54s)]
*  We've already put aside and reserves through my leadership on the council [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3653.82s)]
*  1.9 billion dollars to begin to protect the people of the city of New York from Donald Trump's harsh cuts [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3657.6600000000003s)]
*  We want the administration to not match us go above us [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3664.46s)]
*  We're going to need to make sure that our resources and chatters and Ted on are saying that they're hearing explosions [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3667.94s)]
*  Children our seniors our health care is me safe chatters and as leader of the Ronnie on chatters [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3673.82s)]
*  I've already made a start and doing just that. All right. Thank you, mr. Cuomo [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3679.06s)]
*  Yeah, if we wonder why the people watching this are first frustrated is because of the disconnect of what they're hearing [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3684.3s)]
*  They are afraid on the streets. They feel unsafe. You can quote statistics all day long [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3691.46s)]
*  they get afraid walking into the subway they get afraid walking down the street when they see a [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3697.1800000000003s)]
*  Mentally ill homeless person we did defund the police we did we cut 1 billion dollars from the police [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3702.86s)]
*  People on this stage said defund the police [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3710.5s)]
*  That was the chant and 1 billion dollars was told [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3714.34s)]
*  Department mr. Mondami says he would dismantle the police. He says it wrong. Everyone's laughing now. That's his expression [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3719.74s)]
*  Mr. Lander said I'll admit [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3727.38s)]
*  Progressives like me were slow to recognize [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3731.0s)]
*  the problems of crime and quality of life and [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3734.72s)]
*  Mopeds see it's not so difficult to take responsibility is it that's what he said [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3739.0s)]
*  That they were slow to realize the crime that people were living with [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3744.2799999999997s)]
*  We have to get back to safety. I would add 5,000 police officers. Yes [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3749.64s)]
*  We need mental health professionals who also help work with the mentally ill and they're two totally separate things [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3755.44s)]
*  But this city has to be safe [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3761.88s)]
*  Opportunity for youth is part of it. But if people don't feel safe Harold, they're not going to stay end of story [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3765.04s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I think New Yorkers want accountability they want accountability when people commit crimes [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3777.1600000000003s)]
*  They want accountability when officers use excessive force. They want accountability when top brass [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3782.04s)]
*  Violate their office and they want accountability from elected officials. So yes, I said we were slow to reckon with rising disorder [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3787.88s)]
*  Here's how I'm gonna actually deliver it you [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3796.08s)]
*  You've never taken responsibility [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3800.2799999999997s)]
*  Thing you've done wrong in your entire [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3803.36s)]
*  Your life [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3805.36s)]
*  You should try it sometime [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3809.0s)]
*  Okay, miss miss it. Miss Adams real quick [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3811.32s)]
*  Yeah [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3813.6400000000003s)]
*  I just want to clear up the whole defund mystery here that keeps on being used [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3814.0s)]
*  As far as the New York City Council and the FY 2021 budget is concerned. Let's just be clear. The budget is negotiated [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3818.76s)]
*  with the mayoral administration [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3826.6400000000003s)]
*  The NYPD is a part of the mayoral administration and the reallocation of funds was done with the knowledge of the [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3828.72s)]
*  NYPD not in any far-off land far far away. I don't know how long you've been out of it, mr [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3836.72s)]
*  Cuomo, but it's been a while. So I just want to make sure that we are clear here tonight old [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3842.4s)]
*  Slogans and scare tactics aren't gonna make anybody in New York City safer [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3847.44s)]
*  Okay candidates. Thank you [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3852.48s)]
*  Candidates we're gonna move on to our lightning round [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3855.08s)]
*  That's where every each candidate will answer our questions with a brief response usually yes or no [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3857.08s)]
*  I'm gonna start with a show of hands one despite changes in technology [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3862.72s)]
*  Do you still have a metro card in your wallet show of hands? [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3866.46s)]
*  Mr. Myree, mr. Cuomo miss Adams still have the metro card. God bless you [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3870.64s)]
*  Um [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3875.68s)]
*  Name one department that you would make cuts to we'll go right down the line. Mr. Tilson [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3883.68s)]
*  Israel has declared a special state of emergency in the home front [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3890.12s)]
*  Follow the state of Israel's preemptive strike against Iran. There's a lot of fat to cut in the DOE budget [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3895.52s)]
*  Missile and drone strike against the state of Israel's civilian population is expected [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3900.64s)]
*  They literally started bombing Iran and then declared a state of emergency [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3904.48s)]
*  Claiming it's a preemptive strike against Iran. What the fuck? [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3908.96s)]
*  Efficiency is in every city agency to make them more [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3911.92s)]
*  Run better and efficient. So it's not about cutting or targeting one agency. It's really about doing due diligence and all the agencies [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3915.48s)]
*  Mr. Myree, holy shit. New York City has experienced city services every day. It's not about who has what it's about how we're delivering [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3921.12s)]
*  So I think it's important that we are efficient in that I think we can shift some of [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3927.6s)]
*  Some funding from the Economic Development Corporation to our city's general general. Okay, it's mom down [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3932.04s)]
*  I think we have to end our city's addiction to consulting and contracts [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3937.68s)]
*  We're currently paying McKinsey millions of dollars to design a trash can [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3941.72s)]
*  Last year we paid out two billion dollars in claims against the city [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3947.2799999999997s)]
*  I'll put them on the books of city agencies so they have an incentive to reduce them [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3952.08s)]
*  They can keep half the savings. It's hundreds of millions of dollars. We can say mr. Cuomo city government hasn't been properly managed in 12 years [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3956.18s)]
*  It needs an overhaul from top to bottom [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3964.02s)]
*  That's what I think has to be done. Where'd you start? Where would you start? I? [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3967.62s)]
*  Think if housing is a top priority, I would start with HPD because that's one of the first jobs [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3971.54s)]
*  We have to start. Okay, is that you know, I I'm still negotiating the city budget the only one on the stage [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3976.58s)]
*  That's doing this thing [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3982.18s)]
*  So let's just be real about it the mayor actually is real is not maybe attacking Iran Israel is attacking Iran [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3983.9399999999996s)]
*  Right now they have officially declared a preemptive [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3991.5s)]
*  Attack against Iran and also officially declared a state of emergency [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=3995.7799999999997s)]

*  Now America has said that it won't participate in an Israeli strike on Iran [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4085.94s)]
*  But of course this does not mean that America won't defend Israel, let's be real is America is defending Israel park every day [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4092.3799999999997s)]
*  We circled the park and had a number of favorite playgrounds [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4099.62s)]
*  I'd say the favorite we called playground number one, which is at 96th and 5th and [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4102.94s)]
*  I've actually called for permanently making the parks budget 1% of the city budget [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4108.9s)]

*  Parsons of land and turn them into affordable housing. Do you envision or would you? [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4428.58s)]
*  Sort of signal that that idea could be coupled with funding the funding that you obtain when you start thinking about your own [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4433.54s)]

*  So no one could get ahead of the commodities or futures. I [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4456.92s)]
*  I'm inclined just so you're aware they waited until right after the post-market closed. That's what someone in the chat was saying as well. I [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4460.66s)]

*  Uncertainty or or moments of panic in American discourse as an opportunity to fucking [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4485.62s)]

*  In day-to-day American existence. I feel like Israel could have seen this as a unique opportunity to strike especially as it's a [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4527.26s)]
*  Especially as the the Iran denuclearization agreements with the administration pushed forward [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4535.46s)]
*  Was seemingly going nowhere [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4541.46s)]
*  The only reason why I'm shocked that they did it now after signaling that they would do it sometime before Sunday [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4544.5s)]
*  Was because of Trump's military parade on Saturday [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4550.3s)]
*  I know that sounds really fucking stupid, but Trump is really fucking stupid. He is exactly the type of guy [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4553.14s)]

*  Israel is an extension of America. So nothing Israel does nothing Israel does I think is is considered [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4571.9400000000005s)]
*  Nothing Israel does I think is is considered [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4578.62s)]
*  You know on its own independently from American without American and the organization's platform is not the platform of this campaign [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4582.82s)]
*  The platform this campaign is the one you can find on the website at Zahran for NYC comm [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4590.7s)]
*  That's a platform that is going to deliver an affordable city for New Yorkers who are currently being priced out of what is instead the most [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4595.3s)]
*  Expensive city in the United States [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4601.5s)]
*  It's one that we're going to deliver public safety to each and every New Yorker [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4603.0199999999995s)]
*  To do so by recognizing the critical role that police have to play in that and also by creating the Department of Community Safety [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4606.82s)]
*  So that police do not have to do the work of mental health professionals and that we can follow the example the evidence-based [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4613.26s)]
*  Policies we've seen be successful elsewhere in the country and start to divert those mental health calls [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4619.22s)]
*  Outside of the police so the police department can focus on the seven major categories of crime [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4623.9s)]
*  Next is from Miss Adams [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4632.58s)]

*  Dial it back with the anti-semitism, excuse me [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4658.9s)]
*  No a preemptive strike is actually an act of self-defense if Israel is doing it [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4663.06s)]
*  anyone else doing it to Israel or anywhere else would be considered a [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4669.1s)]
*  Direct escalation of violence. Well, if Israel is doing it then it's actually anti-semitic not to consider it a preemptive [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4675.06s)]
*  defensive act [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4683.3s)]
*  Perhaps the most moral and the most woke and the most kind thing to do [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4685.1s)]
*  I will not allow this kind of anti-semitism to manifest in my community [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4690.74s)]
*  I'm sorry. You are taking a second officer, please [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4696.82s)]
*  But we are the most qualified to lead the city because if we didn't believe that [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4702.62s)]
*  then we would have no business running for mayor and [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4706.139999999999s)]
*  Ultimately, I believe that because I believe the most pressing crisis we're facing here is one of affordability [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4708.82s)]
*  And that is something that my campaign has been laser focused on and that is why I'm proud [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4713.94s)]
*  To say that we are going to address it by freezing the rent for millions of rent stabilized tenants by making the slowest buses [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4718.26s)]
*  In the country fast and free and by delivering universal childcare to each and every New York [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4724.740000000001s)]
*  The reason why I keep meeting this stuff [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4728.46s)]
*  Wow, you've got a big applause [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4730.740000000001s)]
*  The reason why I keep meeting this stuff is because none of them are talking about how they want to visit Tel Aviv [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4732.5s)]
*  Instantly after this debate is over and I feel like this level of unprecedented anti-semitism cannot go on in [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4737.66s)]
*  The New York City mayoral debate it's like kind of fucked up disastrous order sending people with kovat into nursing homes [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4744.860000000001s)]
*  Then as you admitted this week you personally altered the State Health Department report to under count the death total to hide the death total [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4751.860000000001s)]
*  and then [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4760.0s)]
*  Evaded and lied to these families for five years. So tonight will you finally? [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4762.740000000001s)]
*  Apologize to Peter and other grieving New Yorkers or will you just keep? [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4769.1s)]
*  Or will you just keep gaslighting them with blather about what a great job you claim you did [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4775.22s)]
*  Maybe maybe where you come from in st. Louis facts don't matter but here they do so let's talk about that [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4781.34s)]
*  Where you come from on nursing homes? [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4788.7s)]
*  1.2 million people died of kovat in the United States. It's horrendous [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4792.9400000000005s)]
*  83,000 people died in New York State. It is horrendous [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4798.38s)]
*  It was a pandemic unlike anything we've ever seen when it comes to nursing homes [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4801.88s)]
*  We now know the facts because numerous studies have been done [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4806.76s)]
*  New York State implemented i'm not gonna lie [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4811.4800000000005s)]
*  I think they have to visit tel aviv even more now now that israel is preemptively defending itself in [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4814.76s)]
*  an act of of combating anti-semitism, which is [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4820.92s)]
*  When there's just another nation existing in the region [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4824.92s)]
*  And is trying to do a separate denuclearization agreement with america [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4828.280000000001s)]
*  so [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4833.0s)]
*  If these guys don't leave the debate saying i'm israel. Hi, i'm going to [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4833.96s)]
*  Translated i'm going to tel aviv [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4839.3s)]
*  To defend tel aviv with my body with my life [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4842.52s)]
*  That's the maximum anti-semitism and does not give enough credit to the women and men in those nursing homes who work so hard [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4846.12s)]
*  Mr. Arbini [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4854.44s)]
*  Lost the father. I am very very sorry for that. He brought a legal case [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4856.12s)]
*  Against the state the legal case was dismissed when you look at the papers on the case [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4861.72s)]
*  Uh the there was no covid positive person [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4868.28s)]
*  sent from a hospital [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4873.32s)]
*  to the nursing home [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4875.88s)]
*  while [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4878.04s)]
*  Mr. Arbini [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4878.92s)]
*  Was in the nursing home, so it is factually impossible [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4880.92s)]
*  brad [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4886.52s)]
*  That he got covid. Okay from someone coming from a hospital. Okay, mr. Mom donning [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4887.64s)]
*  You know, I I just I I want to address something first [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4894.12s)]
*  Which is that you're gonna ask a question or not. I i'm gonna ask a question [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4897.4800000000005s)]
*  But brad lander is more of a new yorker than andrew cuomo isn't to hear all of this [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4901.0s)]
*  To hear all this about st. Louis. We have to just make this clear [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4905.88s)]
*  Yeah [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4908.76s)]
*  Now all of us on this stage. Wait, who are you gonna ask your question to i'm asking it to andrew cuomo [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4909.96s)]
*  Okay, I feel like most people would have known i'm gonna ask [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4914.6s)]
*  I knew I knew I knew he's charismatic. Zoran is very charismatic [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4918.68s)]
*  We agree [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4924.360000000001s)]
*  All of us on this stage [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4926.92s)]
*  Have spoken about [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4928.92s)]
*  How donald trump is an existential threat? [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4930.52s)]
*  to [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4934.12s)]
*  democracy [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4935.3s)]
*  To the city to this country [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4936.4400000000005s)]
*  And andrew cuomo [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4939.56s)]
*  You have received millions of dollars in funding [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4941.64s)]
*  From the very near devoria channel 12. The operation is coordinated with the u.s [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4945.88s)]
*  Will you now look at the camera breaking and tell your super wait, hold on [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4950.68s)]
*  I want to see this return those millions of dollars and to your own campaign [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4954.360000000001s)]
*  To return that close to half a million dollars to ensure that this is not a race that is bought by those same trump billionaires [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4959.240000000001s)]
*  I know you don't understand the law, but it would be illegal for me to direct an independent expenditure [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4969.240000000001s)]
*  Is it illegal for you to direct your own campaign one question one answer? [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4977.08s)]
*  That's the law. Okay number two [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4981.0s)]
*  I dealt with mr. Trump as governor [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4984.280000000001s)]
*  We had very very difficult times [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4987.08s)]
*  I got more help for new york from trump [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4990.52s)]
*  Than anyone expected [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4994.76s)]
*  New york was one of the few places that he did not send israel launched pre-emptive strikes against iran [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=4996.76s)]
*  Because he didn't want to deal with me [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5003.5599999999995s)]
*  That's the fact I got him to send us masks [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5006.44s)]
*  So are you going to return half a million dollars to your own campaign? And then on your point about oh billionaires [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5009.24s)]
*  Let's remember this [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5016.12s)]
*  I am the candidate on the stage who is [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5017.639999999999s)]
*  Uh supported by more labor unions than any other candidate [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5020.92s)]
*  650 000 working men and women support me then why is it? [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5026.98s)]
*  Let me finish [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5033.719999999999s)]
*  Because they know me and they know my record the firefighters worked with me in storms [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5035.0s)]
*  The utility workers endorsed me because I was in puerto rico putting the power back together after the storms [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5040.92s)]
*  uh every [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5047.96s)]
*  Major union that has endorsed. Okay has endorsed me greater than any candidate on the stage [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5049.8s)]
*  You got the final question. Mr. Cuomo. Yeah [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5057.24s)]
*  You got the final question to anyone on the stage. Yes, my question is to uh, mr. Tilson [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5060.2s)]
*  uh, we learned today that uh, [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5066.6s)]
*  shockingly, uh [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5069.62s)]
*  Mr. Mondani is not part of the dsa, but [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5071.64s)]
*  We've heard his plans over and over and over you're a financial man. You're not a politician. Mr. Tilson [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5075.16s)]
*  Uh, probably smarter than the rest of us in that regard [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5081.48s)]
*  But you've heard his plans for how to build housing how he's going to finance the housing free buses [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5085.88s)]
*  This is her shitting on the unions, by the way [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5091.4s)]
*  Uh, and he said he can do all of this [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5094.5199999999995s)]
*  And our taxes will not be any higher [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5097.96s)]
*  Than new jersey's taxes question. You're a financial expert [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5101.160000000001s)]
*  By the way, this is the reason why he's on that stage [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5106.04s)]
*  So they can double team zoran. Noldo is telling the truth [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5109.4800000000005s)]
*  Please [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5114.06s)]
*  He says he will raise the revenue to uh pay for all the things that I can't even keep track of all the spending promises he's making [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5125.42s)]
*  By raising the corporate tax rate to new jersey's new jersey's level [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5132.860000000001s)]
*  What he is failing? [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5137.18s)]
*  To acknowledge is that there are already many other city and state taxes that in fact if his plan were implemented would results in [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5138.7s)]
*  New york city businesses paying double the tax rate of new jersey triple that of connecticut five times that of florida [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5145.34s)]
*  Which would lead to an exodus of businesses and jobs and crush our city [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5151.1s)]
*  But even more preposterous is that this all has to go through albany [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5155.34s)]
*  There is no appetite for what he is calling for this is a double team [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5160.54s)]
*  This is the reason why he's literally on that stage so that andrew cuomo could attack zoran without directing the question to zoran [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5164.78s)]
*  So they're doubling down and double teaming him city. That's truly delusional [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5172.54s)]
*  So I want to double taxes in new york city. I want to double spending in new york city [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5176.94s)]
*  But I want to do it the way mike bloomberg did it by doubling the size of the economy [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5181.099999999999s)]
*  Which he did over 12 years. It's economic growth that we need not destructive policies that would crush growth. Okay [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5185.66s)]
*  Thank you [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5193.099999999999s)]
*  Thank you candidates. We're gonna move on to a new topic [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5193.98s)]
*  It's a way it's a way to attack zoran without zoran being able to respond that is literally his primary purpose. He's running [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5195.98s)]
*  He's running just to fuck zoran over [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5202.38s)]
*  Unofficial but important task of every new york city mayor has been to bring new yorkers together [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5205.08s)]
*  Even on issues of passionate concern where finding common ground is difficult [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5210.3s)]
*  So let's talk for a few minutes about what kind of job you would do in this area. Mr. Mamdani [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5214.94s)]
*  What is your message to jewish new yorkers who are supportive of israel and fear for their safety in this current political climate [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5220.3s)]
*  That I hear them and that I have heard them over the course of this campaign and before that [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5228.78s)]
*  After the days of the horrific war crime of october 7th a friend of mine told me about how he felt [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5233.26s)]
*  Sitting in his synagogue for shabbat services [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5238.14s)]
*  When he heard the door open and a chill went up his spine as he turned around not knowing who would be there [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5240.54s)]
*  And I heard that even just recently from a jewish man in williamsburg [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5245.66s)]
*  Who told me how he locks the very door that used to be unlocked for so many years out of a concern for his safety [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5248.78s)]
*  I will protect jewish new yorkers and deliver them that safety [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5254.54s)]
*  I will do so as the next mayor of the city and ultimately what I will also say [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5257.900000000001s)]
*  Is to new yorkers who have a disagreement with me on any issue [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5262.38s)]
*  But also on the question of the israeli government's policies that that disagreement I know [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5265.82s)]
*  Is rooted in a shared sense of humanity and in the words of ed kach [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5270.78s)]

*  And that my support for compliance with international law is support for non-violent movements that seek to do so and build on the example [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5314.780000000001s)]
*  That we saw with south africa and ultimately what my focus yes what my focus will be [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5321.5s)]

*  It is going to be on making sure this is a city that is affordable for each and every new yorker [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5329.26s)]

*  In and to ensure that each and every new yorker feels represented by me as their mayor because you can win an election with a majority [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5339.58s)]
*  But it is your job to represent every single person across the city. Okay [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5346.3s)]
*  Mr. Cuomo according to muslim american organizations [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5351.58s)]
*  You never made a public visit to a mosque during your 10 plus years as governor [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5354.88s)]
*  Why the reluctance? [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5359.76s)]
*  Yeah, I believe I have I would have to check the record, but let me just let me correct the record here if I might [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5361.2s)]

*  When they said that in seven years you had never visited a mosque did something happen in the the [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5378.8s)]
*  Several years beyond that. Uh, I believe I have I know I've participated in many forums [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5384.72s)]

*  I mean, what would you say to more than seven hundred and sixty thousand muslims here in the city? [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5402.0s)]
*  About whether or not you would reach out to them make them feel welcome make them feel protected at a time [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5407.12s)]
*  I would say [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5413.76s)]
*  I would say we are a city of immigrants. I welcome them. I love them. I'm not mr. Mandani [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5416.0s)]
*  I'm not anti-semitic. I'm not divisive [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5422.48s)]
*  I didn't say I would boycott israel. I didn't say I would divest from israel. I didn't say I would sanction israel [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5426.4s)]
*  I don't give forums to anti-semites. What does this have to do with forums to [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5432.96s)]
*  Extremists who blame america for 9 11? [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5438.7s)]
*  I didn't say that I would boycott cornell tech neon because they're pro israel [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5442.4s)]
*  He is the flip side of the coin of trump [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5448.4s)]
*  trump says he'll boycott cornell because they're [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5452.0s)]
*  Wait, that was was he talking about me a boycott cornell because they're pro israel was I a vision [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5455.44s)]
*  Is our death in this city this state in this nation? [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5463.28s)]
*  And the vision is what trump sells we should be selling unity [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5468.4s)]
*  Not the division that this man is spreading mr. Mandani [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5474.639999999999s)]
*  you you [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5479.12s)]
*  By the way question about islamophobia [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5481.44s)]
*  Ridiculous to hear mr. Cuomo talk about himself as a man of unity when just yesterday [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5483.82s)]
*  We found out that his super pack was sending mail that artificially darkened and lengthened my beard [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5491.2s)]
*  To stoke the very fears of that division in this city [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5498.72s)]
*  The reason he doesn't have a message for muslim new yorkers is because he has nothing to say to us [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5502.08s)]
*  Because he doesn't see us as if we are every other new yorker and ultimately the campaign [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5507.76s)]
*  The campaign that I am running is a campaign that seeks to go beyond the politics of the trump era [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5513.28s)]
*  Where candidates on the stage describe me as a monster describe me at the gates where they say that I am in fact the other [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5519.599999999999s)]
*  This is a campaign to bring people together. It's why we have the support of jewish and muslim new yorkers [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5527.12s)]
*  It's why we have the support of people across the five boroughs. Look real quick [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5532.96s)]
*  Yeah, uh, you don't bring new yorkers together by saying [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5537.52s)]
*  President obama is evil and president obama is a liar. You don't bring them together by saying hakeem jeffries [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5541.18s)]
*  Is like george wallace and the das sending ads to hakeem jeffries with watermelons [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5548.16s)]
*  Koch didn't say [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5554.820000000001s)]
*  Uh what you said he said he said anyone who threatens israel. I would never support [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5556.660000000001s)]
*  Okay, that's what kach says and that's you we're going to bring in the other candidates [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5562.5s)]
*  I want you to tell me and we'll do this 60 seconds and keep it a real 60 seconds [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5567.06s)]
*  What would you do as far as bringing people together around this particular issue? [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5571.54s)]
*  Which has brought people into the streets and caused so much controversy in new york [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5575.3s)]
*  Errol all new yorkers deserve to feel safe no matter who they are [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5578.740000000001s)]
*  As city council speaker, I have allocated millions of dollars [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5582.9800000000005s)]
*  To combat anti-semitism as mayor. I will fully fund to protect all new yorkers something that our current mayor has not done [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5587.700000000001s)]
*  We're going to fully fund the commission on human rights to make sure that we are [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5596.42s)]
*  Like a targeted assassination attempt citizens of the city of new york right now that commission is significantly under staff [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5601.14s)]
*  20 percent of their headcount is lacking and as mayor i'm going to make sure that that headcount is appropriate [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5608.58s)]
*  And that we are truly looking forward forward to unifying this city [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5615.54s)]
*  Anti-semitism has grown and it is at its peak in new york city. That is unacceptable [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5620.56s)]
*  It should be unacceptable to everyone on this stage and it is something that as mayor we are going to [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5625.3s)]
*  Unify this city once and for all and treating [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5631.3s)]
*  This topic is so fucking annoying [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5635.22s)]
*  You [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZH1U5fRQkQ&t=5638.34s)]
