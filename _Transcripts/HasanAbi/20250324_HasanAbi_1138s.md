# Hossam Shabat Is Gone | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8)
*  So yeah, rest in power, Hassam Shabbat. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm glad that at least he's now finally found peace. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=3.3200000000000003s)]
*  Um, on the other hand, I do want to show you something more positive. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=7.2s)]
*  If you want to understand the impact of someone like him, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=11.92s)]
*  like a kid himself, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=15.96s)]
*  if you want to understand, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  um, like- [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=20.84s)]
*  I'm not gonna start off with Israel related stuff because I don't want to- I don't want to dive into it yet because I- it's- it's too much, okay? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=22.04s)]
*  It's too much. I'm not gonna get into it first with- with Israel related- with the- with the Israel stuff today, okay? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=35.96s)]
*  I'm gonna obviously talk about it. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=42.599999999999994s)]
*  Israel come- and Israel came to journals yesterday. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=45.599999999999994s)]
*  One of them is- is someone who I frequently talk to to get updates. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=49.559999999999995s)]
*  He was a contributor to Al Jazeera. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=56.36s)]
*  Uh, I've talked about him before. His name is Hassam Shabbat. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=59.239999999999995s)]
*  He was 23 years old. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=63.559999999999995s)]
*  Israel had put him on a leaflet claiming that he was a terrorist alongside five other journalists a couple months prior, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=65.96s)]
*  which was a death sentence. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=78.2s)]
*  And I reached out to him at the time when I saw that and- and, um, you know, he- he did not seem discouraged. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=80.2s)]
*  He was- he was steadfast and, uh, till the- till the very last breath he was trying to put the word out about what was happening to his people, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=88.84s)]
*  what was happening to the Palestinians. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=99.16s)]
*  Um, Dylan Saba had a really good, um, statement on this and I want to read it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=102.11999999999999s)]
*  He said, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=108.11999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=132.12s)]
*  Israel is deliberately targeting the- the last couple of journalists that are basically alive in Gaza at this point. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=140.12s)]
*  Yeah. One of his last messages that he ever posted was actually about his colleague that Israel had assassinated a couple- like a couple moments prior, like an hour prior to his own assassination. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=161.08s)]
*  These are real human beings. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=177.08s)]
*  These are- these are real human beings. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=179.08s)]
*  They have dreams. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=181.08s)]
*  Hassam himself became a journalist. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=183.08s)]
*  Like, he's- he's, you know. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=185.08s)]
*  This is a person who should have gone to college, should have lived a whole life, and it was taken from him. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=188.04000000000002s)]
*  That opportunity was taken from him by the genocidal apartheid regime that only gets to do this with our weapons, with our tax dollars, with our funds, and with our go-ahead. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=194.04000000000002s)]
*  It's- I- I don't know what else to say. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=212.04000000000002s)]
*  Here is his final statement from his team. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=215.0s)]
*  He wrote this and his team published it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=217.0s)]
*  This is Hassam's team and we're sharing his final message. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=221.0s)]
*  If you're reading this, it means I have been most likely targeted by the Israeli occupation forces. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=225.0s)]
*  When all this began, I was only 21 years old, a college student with dreams like anyone else. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=231.0s)]
*  For the past 18 months, I have dedicated every moment of my life to my people. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=235.0s)]
*  I documented the horrors in northern Gaza minute by minute, determined to show the world the truth they tried to bury. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=239.96s)]
*  I slept on pavements, in schools, in tents. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=245.96s)]
*  Each day was a battle for survival. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=249.96s)]
*  I endured hunger for months, yet I never left my people's side. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=251.96s)]
*  By God, I fulfilled my duty as a journalist. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=255.96s)]
*  I risked everything to report the truth, and now I am finally at rest. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=259.96s)]
*  Something I haven't known in the past 18 months. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=263.96s)]
*  I did all this because I believe in the Palestinian cause. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=266.91999999999996s)]
*  I believe this land is ours, and it has been the highest honor of my life to die defending it and serving its people. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=268.91999999999996s)]
*  I ask you now, do not stop speaking about Gaza. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=274.91999999999996s)]
*  Do not let the world look away. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=278.91999999999996s)]
*  Keep fighting. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=280.91999999999996s)]
*  Keep telling our stories until Palestine is free. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=282.91999999999996s)]
*  For the last time, Hassam Shabbat from northern Gaza. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=284.91999999999996s)]
*  He was one of the few remaining journalists in northern Gaza as Israel shut off the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=288.91999999999996s)]
*  Netzerim Corridor and decided to starve out the northern Gaza population, leading up to the ceasefire. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=295.88s)]
*  He was one of the only people who was able to give others information on [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=301.88s)]
*  the the accelerated that was taking place in northern Gaza. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=307.88s)]
*  Yes, I know about Basel as well. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=311.88s)]
*  I'm going to talk about it as well. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=313.88s)]
*  You guys don't have to literally link everything. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=315.88s)]
*  I know everything that's going on. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=317.88s)]
*  I know. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=319.88s)]
*  Let me finish talking about this. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=321.88s)]
*  Listen, I don't know what else to say. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=324.84s)]
*  I mean, this has happened so many times. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=328.84s)]
*  It's just crazy to think like I had I was supposed to bring on I was supposed to bring him on the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=330.84s)]
*  broadcast and I had legitimate worries that having him on the broadcast and put even additional cross [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=338.84s)]
*  on him. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=349.79999999999995s)]
*  And I didn't want to have any responsibility for that. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=351.79999999999995s)]
*  And Israel went ahead and killed him anyway. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=353.79999999999995s)]
*  It's just insane to think about that. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=355.79999999999995s)]
*  It's insane that this is a calculation that people make. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=359.79999999999995s)]
*  He also was a contributor to DropSite News alongside Al Jazeera as well. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=363.79999999999995s)]
*  So yeah, rest in power, Hassam Shabbat. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=367.79999999999995s)]
*  I'm glad that at least he's now finally found peace. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=371.79999999999995s)]
*  On the other hand, I do want to show you something more positive. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=376.76s)]
*  If you want to understand the impact of someone like him, like a kid himself. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=380.76s)]
*  If you want to understand, like I just want to show you this. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=386.76s)]
*  Here's Hassam in his car in his press vest talking to a Ghazan kid. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=392.76s)]
*  She says, I swear I missed you. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=398.76s)]
*  They said that you were martyred. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=400.76s)]
*  Why? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=402.76s)]
*  When the occupation entered the north. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=405.71999999999997s)]
*  We were about to mourn you, man. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=407.71999999999997s)]
*  I swear. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=409.71999999999997s)]
*  Was it that bad? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=411.71999999999997s)]
*  We missed you. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=413.71999999999997s)]
*  What do you believe in? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=415.71999999999997s)]
*  He asks. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=417.71999999999997s)]
*  And she says that there's no god but Allah. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=419.71999999999997s)]
*  I swear to God that I came down to see you. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=421.71999999999997s)]
*  I swear by Allah that I came down to see you. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=423.71999999999997s)]
*  So you missed us. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=425.71999999999997s)]
*  I swear I missed you all. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=427.71999999999997s)]
*  You're a real champ. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=429.71999999999997s)]
*  So then Hassam asks, what do you want to be when you grow up? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=431.71999999999997s)]
*  And she says, a journalist. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=434.68s)]
*  And I was thinking, how am I supposed to become a journalist now if Hassam Shabat were martyred? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=436.68s)]
*  How am I supposed to become a journalist then? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=440.68s)]
*  Why martyred? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=442.68s)]
*  Why martyred then? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=444.68s)]
*  No, may God keep you safe. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=446.68s)]
*  But how am I supposed to become a journalist then? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=448.68s)]
*  He said we'll make you into a journalist, inshallah. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=450.68s)]
*  I swear I missed you. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=453.64s)]
*  He said you have martyred. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=455.64s)]
*  What for? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=457.64s)]
*  I didn't miss you. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=459.64s)]
*  I'm in a new era in which I think our cries, our words are not that consequential. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=483.64s)]
*  I still won't stop. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=493.64s)]
*  And I don't think that this can continue. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=495.64s)]
*  I don't think that this can go on. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=497.64s)]
*  I don't think that this kind of death, this kind of carnage can continue without real consequences for those who dish it out. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=499.64s)]
*  While we're having these conversations, while I'm showing you this, there are active initiatives to obviously suppress any kind of student activism. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=510.59999999999997s)]
*  And it's actually seen a lot of success in the United States of America. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=518.6s)]
*  As you know, I covered the fact that Columbia University completely capitulated after trying to actively suppress the student movements that were trying to divest from the state that's doing this. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=522.6s)]
*  A perfectly reasonable and moral demand. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=536.6s)]
*  The bare minimum demand, really. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=539.5600000000001s)]
*  They fired and took away the diplomas of Jewish students like Grant Minor, who was the head of the Student Union, like the Student Workers Union, the UAW Student Union there, Teachers Union, Student Union there. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=541.5600000000001s)]
*  And they kidnapped Mahmoud Khalil in the dead of the night, a legal permanent resident. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=562.52s)]
*  And it's not going to end there. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=570.52s)]

*  It was actually incapacitated prior. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=834.28s)]

*  Yeah. The Turkish hospital that they blew up, they did a controlled demolition on it. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=866.28s)]
*  As in, they used it as a military base and then they placed explosives all around the cancer ward, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=871.28s)]
*  the only cancer ward in Gaza that could have been operational, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=880.28s)]
*  but it wasn't because Israel was using it as a military base. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=882.28s)]

*  because my situation is infinitely better. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=1082.28s)]
*  Like it's not even comparable. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=1087.28s)]
*  It's not even comparable. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=1090.28s)]
*  You're behaving like children in general. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=1092.28s)]
*  It's comparable to the conditions that these people I talk about, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=1094.28s)]
*  the conditions that they face. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=1100.28s)]
*  I have an endless amount of privilege, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=1102.28s)]
*  and I try to use it to the best of my ability to speak out for those who have no voice. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=1105.28s)]
*  And you do too, chatters. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=1111.28s)]
*  Remember that if you're an American citizen, if you're Jewish, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=1113.28s)]
*  there are extra privileges that you have. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=1116.28s)]
*  If you are an anti-Zionist Jew, you need to be at the forefront of these protests. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=1120.28s)]
*  If you're an American citizen, you need to be at the forefront of these protests. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=1126.28s)]
*  We all have to play a role. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yab7Jq75WK8&t=1130.28s)]
