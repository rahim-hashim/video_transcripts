*  Okay, like World War two doesn't fit the standard. There's never been a moment where America has ever in its history [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY7oApDsjn4&t=78.03999999999999s)]

*  The proof of what I'm saying. I was thinking about this from the thought exercise where I'm like [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY7oApDsjn4&t=109.96s)]

*  They've never actually felt before because you know, obviously this is a very capable. It's a violent organization [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY7oApDsjn4&t=140.44s)]
*  They have no clue if we organize these tier one units against them [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY7oApDsjn4&t=145.56s)]
*  This is gonna be [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY7oApDsjn4&t=151.92000000000002s)]
