# Iran Is Striking Back At Israel | Hasanabi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [October 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek)
*  And this was like, are you still on Iraq? What is Iraq doing? Like, what is Iraq involved in any way? Just drop that in there, bro. He just dropped Iraq in the conversation demonstrating his position is just like, so what's up? Are you with the, you know, are you with the sand people or what? Like, who are you with? Are you with the civilization or the sand people? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=0.0s)]
*  Usual to Israel, I don't know, because, like I said, I've only learned from mainstream media, I've only watched major media. So I'm like a little confused. I'm a little confused right now as to why the tone and the and the coverage is like so dramatically different because for the past 12 months, that was awesome, right? Like it was sick. Israel was so mighty, and so good at what it does. Israel also [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=18.88s)]
*  literally has an Iron Dome. Okay. Israel currently has the might of the American military, Jordanian coverage, American coverage, Saudi coverage. They got literally regional partners trying to defend Israel to the best of their ability. And the Iron Dome is getting overwhelmed. Okay, let's see what Al Jazeera saying. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=48.88s)]
*  I will warn all of you. Don't get callous. Do not think, do not think you can post like an Israel defender. Okay, you cannot. I'm letting you know right now, you will literally go to prison. Okay, your life, they will end your life. You will go to prison. Okay, you will go to prison. Okay, you will go to prison. Okay, you will go to prison. Okay, you will go to prison. Okay, you will go to prison. Okay, you will go to prison. Okay, you will go to prison. Okay, you will go to prison. Okay, you will go to prison. Okay, you will go to prison. Okay, you will go to prison. Okay, you will go to prison. Okay, you will go to prison. Okay, you will go to prison. Okay, you will go to prison. Okay, you will go to prison. Okay, you will go to prison. Okay, you will go to prison. Okay, you will go to prison. Okay, you will [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=70.32s)]
*  go to jail potentially for supporting terrorism. It don't work that way. Do not fed post. Do not fed post in the chat. I'm letting you know. I'm letting you know right now. A lot of you did this. You did this on October 7 too. And you got got. Okay, you will never you you will have to sit there and eat the callous indifference and the cackling hyenas over on the side of the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=100.32s)]
*  defending Israel brigade every damn day as they point to like children and body bags, children and trash bags and say they deserve it. And if you were to ever say anything, even marginally, marginally close to that, if you were to ever even celebrate it, you will get branded a terrorist. I'm letting you know. I'm letting you know right now. Don't do it. Don't do it. Okay, having said that, however, the hypocrisy is a little bit alarming. I mean, it's just, it's thick. It's [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=130.32s)]
*  thick. You know, I just I'm I'm I'm experiencing things that you think I would I didn't think I'd be seeing, you know, coverage that I didn't think starting a ground operation. And then this hit today is changed completely the course of event. But it's also spoiling Benjamin Netanyahu presented himself as a future leader of the Middle East was going to punish anyone that attacked Israel. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=160.32s)]
*  Elijah, you said Iran was, quote, escalating to deescalate, which is, you know, it's, it's kind of a kind of a strange quote, but it's one we've heard several times in the last few days. And really, the first time we heard it was from Israel that that's what they were trying to do in Lebanon against Hezbollah. The idea of escalate to deescalate is essentially show your military muscle show that you're stronger in order to deter your enemy and and prevent the bigger war. If everybody's doing the same thing and is adopting the same [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=188.72s)]
*  logic, where's this taking us? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=218.72s)]
*  Well, it's all in the hand of Benjamin Netanyahu. He is the one who dictating the temple. He's the one who's going to war on Lebanon. He's the one who started an all out war on the Gaza against the civilians, not only Hamas, and then turn against Lebanon, hit Hudaida and then went to Iran and assassinated Ismail [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=221.6s)]
*  and he either he bombed the Iranian consulate in Damascus. He is the one who is escalating for his personal reason to remain in power. And because he's feeling all this victory, he doesn't feel concerned about stopping the war on the country. He wants to continue. And this is why Iran is saying [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=243.84s)]
*  I'm going to come in. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=264.8s)]
*  missiles hitting an airbase, the Neva team airbase in the negative, bro, that's crazy. Okay. Now look, they got hella they got bunkers. Okay. Iran does not have the same munitions that Israel has. Iran is not flying F 15s over targets and directly striking them. Their capabilities are diminished in comparison to what Israel can do to a defenseless area that it occupies. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=266.64s)]
*  Such as the Gaza Strip or a defenseless country with a paramilitary that is all that remains to defend them like Lebanon. Okay, Lebanon does not have any anti air systems in general. That is by design. It's so that Israel can fly over it and destroy it when they want to. Okay. And I need you to understand. I need you to understand something. Okay, this entire this entire situation and I want everyone to remember this, this entire situation could have been a [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=294.8s)]
*  avoided since day one, it could have been avoided from the jump. All it would have required was demanding that Joe Biden do the elder statesman thing, which is rain in Israel. People in his corner told him to do that. People in his people literally told him over and over again. Hey, dog, you know how Israel gets bro, please, please tell him the dial at the back. He was like, Nope. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=324.8s)]
*  Well, how about above it? Oh, look alive, Jack. I love Israel. I'm a Zionist. Israel can kill as many babies as it wants. Jack, look alive. Here's the facts. I'm a Zionist. Okay, rain it in. Rain it in. I've said it a million fucking times. I said I said it a million times over the course of the past 12 months. I was like, rain it in. Rain Israel in. Please rain Israel in. I even said, listen, if you're a bloodless, monstrous, sociopathic piece of [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=349.8s)]
*  shit, but you still care about at least like retaining power, at least if you care about the Democratic Party winning the election, don't leave Netanyahu with a fat arsenal of weapons and a willingness to do the bidding of Donald Trump because he's in the tank for Donald Trump. He's going to go to war with Lebanon. He's going to invade Lebanon. Everyone's like Hassan. You're being ridiculous. Hassan, you're being crazy. Where are we now? Where are we now? I said it for months. Am I prophetic? No, I'm a dumbass. Okay, I'm a stupid idiot. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=379.8s)]
*  Who sits around in front of a computer all goddamn day. I just know a little bit about the way Israel behaves. That's it. I've just done a little bit of reading. That's it. Like a minor amount. If you are even remotely interested in the in the history of the region, you arrive at this conclusion on your own. If you only get your from, I don't know, random YouTubers or dick riding Israel into oblivion, or if you're only getting your news from MSNBC, CNN, Western media without ever like applying a little bit of media literacy, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=409.8s)]
*  or applying a little bit of critical thinking, you're like, Oh, how did this happen? Israel's the victim once again, it's crazy, dude. Dude, they've been doing this. They've been doing this, like for 76 years. Of course, a lot of the regional actors have basically designed their entire existence around [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=439.8s)]
*  maintaining a defensive posture, maintaining a deterrent strategy, and developing an arsenal specifically to combat this kind of thing that Israel does on a regular basis. And since October 7, Israel has been doing infinitely work that Tel Aviv is receiving currently every goddamn day, every goddamn day, every day, dude. So if you are now going, how could this have happened? How is this going? How could this have ever happened? Who would have foreseen this like a little boy? I mean, I'm not a little boy. I'm not a little boy. I'm not a little boy. I'm not a little boy. I'm not a little boy. I'm not a little boy. I'm not a little boy. I'm not a little boy. I'm not a little boy. I'm not a little boy. I'm not a little boy. I'm not a little boy. I'm not a little boy. I'm not a little boy. I'm not a little boy. I'm not a little boy. I'm not a little boy. I'm [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=459.52s)]
*  not a little boy. I'm not a little boy. I mean the whole of Australia is under threat by this kind of shit, hell yes! Like I've been telling you that this was gonna happen! [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=489.52s)]
* ing I'm sorry. I'm sorry. This isn't normal. Every single one of these rockets is meant to kill. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=497.96s)]
*  Yeah no dude, that's what rockets do dumbass. That's what your rockets do to the Palestinians, like get the fuck out of here. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=503.58s)]
*  What are we doing? Never seen the Iron Dome like this. Iran build different. I've never seen a total failure of Israeli interceptors like this completely ineffective against Iranian missiles to the point of comedy. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=510.34s)]
*  It is insane, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=518.0s)]
*  thinking? What were they thinking? Also, this is the most [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=518.16s)]
*  Israel thing to do, okay? There is nothing more Israel to be [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=520.9599999999999s)]
*  like, oh, we're getting bombed in a way that we never have. What [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=524.28s)]
*  to do? Oh, it's time to post like a goddamn teenager. Dude, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=529.4s)]
*  what are you doing? This is the national account of the state, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=534.1999999999999s)]
*  okay, of an apartheid state that is currently conducting a [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=538.6s)]
*  genocide, okay? And they're posting like an anxiety ridden [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=541.78s)]
*  teenager like this isn't normal. What are you doing, bro? Stop [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=546.56s)]
*  normalizing this problematic behaviors of missiles a thread. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=550.76s)]
*  Is this the start of World War Three? I don't think so. But I [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=554.28s)]
*  don't know, man. I don't know. I don't know. Okay, I'll be [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=558.14s)]
*  honest. It is unique to Iran to do this. Okay. Like it was it [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=562.0s)]
*  was already it was already unceremonious and out of pocket [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=569.1999999999999s)]
*  for Iran to even retaliate against Israel at all. But that [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=572.8399999999999s)]
*  was a managed retaliation. Okay, that was a managed [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=575.36s)]
*  retaliation. That was genuinely a previously communicated [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=578.64s)]
*  retaliation. And they struck like one military base overall. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=585.24s)]
*  They didn't deploy they told what they were going to do ahead [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=589.6800000000001s)]
*  of time. Like they gave literally like a week's notice [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=592.16s)]
*  or some this time is different. It's a little different. It [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=595.2s)]
*  kind of caught everybody by surprise. They still gave for [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=598.96s)]
*  warning but the for warning was significantly shorter, right? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=602.2s)]
*  And I don't know what is Pat Bev doing over there. I don't know. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=607.0s)]
*  But if I'm Pat Bev, I'm getting the out. Don't worry, America [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=610.5600000000001s)]
*  will give you a flight out. Unlike those in Lebanon. If [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=613.48s)]
*  you're in the crosshairs of Israeli bombing, of course, you [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=617.6400000000001s)]
*  don't get a flight out there. But if you're in Israel, don't [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=620.1400000000001s)]
*  worry, America will find a way to transport your ass out of [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=622.6s)]
*  there and back into safe territory. You know, Pat Bev [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=626.0400000000001s)]
*  is cooked. Anyway, Israel just promised to retaliate. Yeah, I [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=630.8s)]
*  know. They did. They warned this morning. They warned senior [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=635.56s)]
*  Iranian officials said the US was alerted by Iran through [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=639.24s)]
*  diplomatic channels shortly before the attacks. But that was [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=642.52s)]
*  not a long ass for warning. That's a little different. This [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=645.4s)]
*  is the message Israelis across Jerusalem are receiving right [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=648.3199999999999s)]
*  now. Imagine living like this. Dude, are you bro, bro? Are you [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=651.8399999999999s)]
*  serious? Are you serious? Imagine living like this? Yeah, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=655.6s)]
*  dude. That's how Palestinians live every day. They don't even [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=661.0s)]
*  have the home front command. They just eat it. They don't have [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=664.36s)]
*  bomb shelters. 12 months of genocide, bro. No way. No way. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=668.16s)]
*  Turns out bombs killed. That's crazy. I'm actually shocked, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=673.5600000000001s)]

*  but I think he wants somehow to get that Iran doesn't become [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=901.2s)]
*  nuclear power. And he knows that he needs America for this. So [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=907.32s)]
*  yes, he has something in the back of his mind that if this is [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=914.0s)]
*  an opportunity to involve America, he would push for it. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=918.72s)]

*  back in 1982. And we failed. And I think Israel should talk about [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=935.44s)]

*  So we don't have a final assessment. I didn't realize I [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=964.72s)]
*  thought it was still going on. We don't have a I don't have a [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=968.44s)]
*  final assessment of what's happening. No, this is live. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=971.4s)]
*  Al Jazeera is live right now. It's just that the attacks are [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=974.88s)]
*  from earlier. They're just showing they're just showing the [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=978.04s)]
*  wave of attacks from earlier. Okay. You think the recent [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=981.04s)]
*  escalation with Lebanon now and now Iran was BB coaxing attacks [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=985.24s)]
*  to boost his approval. Benjamin Netanyahu has wanted a war with [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=989.44s)]
*  Iran for most of his life. Okay. This is the reason why he was [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=993.88s)]
*  heavily against the Iran denuclearization agreement [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=998.56s)]
*  because he was terrified of the prospect of normalizing [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1000.92s)]
*  relationship with Iran. That's why he kept mercilessly and [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1003.32s)]
*  relentlessly attacking the Obama administration for its [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1008.52s)]
*  signature accomplishment on that front. That's why that's part of [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1011.28s)]
*  the reason why he loved Donald Trump. IDF IDF has announced as [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1014.08s)]
*  far as I understand they've announced that they're like [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1019.96s)]
*  going to retaliate. And but like but the thing is, here's the [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1022.64s)]
*  issue. Okay. They already have been yesterday they bombed [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1027.1200000000001s)]
*  Damascus and Lebanon. Like they they they already have been [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1031.48s)]
*  nonstop attacking. The only difference in this [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1036.1200000000001s)]
*  circumstances, they'll probably attack Iran. And I don't know if [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1038.32s)]
*  they'll actually attack Iran with even more weapons than [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1041.52s)]
*  prior. And I don't know what that looks like. This is unique [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1045.72s)]
*  territory. Overall, this is new territory. Overall, it's not [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1049.48s)]
*  unique in the sense that like, Israelis have been literally [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1053.52s)]
*  begging to nuke Tehran for quite a while. Okay, but Israel [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1056.6s)]
*  already bombed Yemen yesterday, they bombed Damascus, they bomb [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1061.44s)]
*  Lebanon, they've been bombing Lebanon. The only difference is [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1064.56s)]
*  now they'll bomb Iran again. Haasan, I'll be people on [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1067.64s)]
*  Reddit are saying Iran just started this war history yet [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1071.2s)]
*  again reset today. Yeah, word I got is that this will be like [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1073.28s)]
*  the April attacks Israel retaliate by attacking Hezbollah [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1076.08s)]
*  and Lebanon, not Iran and Iran will use the posture of the [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1078.28s)]
*  Arab world that they can do something but not expected [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1080.3999999999999s)]
*  anything else to happen like April, we'll see. But the [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1082.68s)]
*  difference in this circumstance of the Iranian retaliation was [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1086.0s)]
*  the was the lack of like was the lack of prior knowledge of the [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1091.04s)]
*  retaliation like they only they only revealed that they were [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1097.84s)]
*  going to retaliate. They only revealed that they were going to [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1101.68s)]
*  retaliate right before they actually launched their missiles. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1104.6s)]
*  Last time they gave like seven days of warning they telegraphed [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1108.8s)]
*  it they were like, hey, we're gonna come we're gonna retaliate [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1112.9199999999998s)]
*  we're gonna retaliate if Israel doesn't do something about it. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1114.76s)]
*  We're gonna retaliate we have a right to defend our sovereignty. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1116.7199999999998s)]
*  This time it was relatively quick. BM is posting throughout [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1118.84s)]
*  the Middle East what a bunch of psychos the idea of after the [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1122.6s)]
*  Iranian attack the Air Force will attack strongly tonight [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1124.56s)]
*  throughout the Middle East. We'll see Al Jazeera [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1126.7199999999998s)]
*  correspondent in Tehran is saying there will be another [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1130.9199999999998s)]
*  wave of attacks. It is pretty crazy that all of this was [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1133.0s)]
*  absolutely telegraphed. Okay. All of this stuff was telegraphed [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1137.0s)]
*  from the jump. It was telegraphed from the jump. It's [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1141.08s)]
*  not like we didn't know this was going to happen. Of course, we [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1144.6s)]
*  knew this was going to happen. What the was anybody expecting? [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1147.36s)]
*  And for the record, what Israel will do I suspect when they say [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1150.56s)]
*  they're going to retaliate is probably kill a bunch of Gazan [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1154.6s)]
*  civilians. Okay, as they have been they haven't really stopped [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1158.28s)]
*  killing civilians. They killed like 34 the other day. It's just [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1161.6s)]
*  that the attention has shifted over to the Lebanese civilians [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1164.8s)]
*  they're killing by the hundreds, right in Beirut. So that's [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1167.8799999999999s)]
*  probably what they're going to do. They're going to pummel [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1171.36s)]
*  civilians, they're going to punish civilians as hard as they [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1172.96s)]
*  possibly can because they only have one speed. They only know to [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1176.9199999999998s)]
*  do one thing and that's kill civilians. And that's precisely [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1179.6s)]
*  what they're gonna do. I just don't think that I don't know. I [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1183.48s)]
*  just will this inevitably cause Israel to implode on itself? I [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1187.52s)]
*  mean, all of these things, all of these things actually hurt the [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1191.44s)]
*  psyche of the Israeli citizens, because Israel gets to be Israel [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1197.72s)]
*  only responds to violence. Okay. Israel only backs away when they [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1202.48s)]
*  are forced to back away through violent retaliation. I think [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1208.0s)]
*  there was a terror attack as well. Like there was a I think [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1211.0s)]
*  like, like a shooting attack inside of Israel as well. And in [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1214.24s)]
*  I don't know if it was in coordination, it probably was in [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1218.72s)]
*  coordination with the bombings. But ultimately, ultimately, what [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1220.94s)]
*  is going to ultimately what's going to happen is because [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1225.6200000000001s)]
*  Israel only responds to force with more escalation, but only [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1228.7s)]
*  backs away when they fear that there are real repercussions for [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1234.18s)]
*  Israel. Okay. That's that's what they've educated the entire [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1239.02s)]
*  region on. So that's why these things are happening. Inevitably, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1243.14s)]
*  they can only get away with this, they can only get away [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1248.5s)]
*  with like further and further escalating when they have this [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1251.22s)]
*  security. When they have the Iron Dome, when they have the [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1254.44s)]
*  confidence that like the regional actors, no matter how [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1258.22s)]
*  they retaliate, Israel will be able to protect its citizens, it [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1261.14s)]
*  will be able to protect the civilians, right? When that [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1264.58s)]
*  security veneer, when that when that mentality goes away, when [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1267.66s)]
*  normal Israeli society starts fearing that there is retaliation [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1273.78s)]
*  for all of the dangerous escalations, the calculation [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1278.98s)]
*  changes dramatically. Because remember, Israel is within the [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1282.26s)]
*  sphere of Western influence. It is like a Western country in the [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1286.74s)]
*  Middle East. So people go to work, people have marketing [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1290.14s)]
*  jobs. Okay, I think it was two people from Jaffa, six dead, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1293.74s)]
*  mostly civilians and a few others wounded. Thank you, Tom [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1296.94s)]
*  with that. Oh, I'm glad you're safe. So So when you know, you [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1299.58s)]
*  got DJs. Oh, sorry from Hebron, but the attack was in Haifa. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1305.22s)]
*  projectiles were intercepted over Jerusalem Tuesday evening [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1310.1799999999998s)]
*  as Iran said it fired dozens of missiles into Israel's retaliation [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1312.58s)]
*  for killings of leaders of Hezbollah and Hamas air raid [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1315.26s)]
*  sirens are sounding across Israel. So do you think an [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1317.6999999999998s)]

*  Yeah, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1523.46s)]
*  BBC and ABC are saying I'm provoked the tag on Israel. Of [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1540.3s)]
*  course, they're saying that dude, the attack the only attacks [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1543.7s)]
*  that are provoked are our dude, Israel gets to listen, you have [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1547.02s)]

*  told me that there were moments where Netanyahu also changed the [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1563.74s)]
*  parameters of what he wanted there. And I think the really [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1566.46s)]
*  big challenge has been is one Middle East source told me you [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1569.5400000000002s)]
*  as the negotiating party cannot want this ceasefire more than [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1573.26s)]
*  the parties on the ground involved. And that's where I [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1577.42s)]
*  think the struggle has been for Biden. This White House has [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1579.58s)]
*  wanted an end to the conflict. But it's not clear that the [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1581.6599999999999s)]
*  parties involved wanted it as much as Biden. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1584.22s)]
*  Asma, thank you, Joe Brands at the White House for us today. So [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1586.58s)]
*  I guess two questions for you, Jay, as we're getting a number [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1590.46s)]
*  of leaders from the Hill weighing in on what's happening [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1593.98s)]
*  overseas. We do know that the president was in the sit room, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1597.3s)]
*  the vice president, right next to him, monitoring what was [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1601.26s)]
*  happening as Iran was launching those missiles. Do we know what [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1605.78s)]
*  exactly he is he is doing now? And is he also in a wait and see [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1610.26s)]
*  mode, waiting to see what Israel is going to do? Or do you think [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1616.66s)]
*  he'll get a heads up from Benjamin Netanyahu as to what [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1619.78s)]
*  may happen next? [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1623.42s)]
*  Well, a number of different things to unpack in that. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1624.78s)]
*  Firstly, I can tell you that when the president and the vice [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1627.3s)]
*  president were in the situation, people are largely White House [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1630.38s)]
*  officials say to coordinate the defensive response, the US [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1633.94s)]
*  wider market is down today, trying to shoot down some of [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1638.22s)]
*  these missiles and succeeding in shooting down some of these [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1641.5800000000002s)]
*  missiles. Exactly how many the Israelis were able to intercept [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1644.1000000000001s)]
*  versus the US and potentially other allies shooting down is [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1648.02s)]
*  very much unclear. But we know that that was what the president [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1651.74s)]
*  and the vice president were monitoring there, the defensive [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1655.1000000000001s)]
*  ability by US military assets to shoot down some of these missiles [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1658.38s)]
*  in participation, of course, in defending their Israeli partners. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1663.22s)]
*  We also know that senior White House officials telegraphed that [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1666.5800000000002s)]
*  there would be quote, severe consequences for Iran, if there [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1669.54s)]
*  was a direct strike of this nature at Israel, exactly what [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1673.98s)]
*  severe consequences look like is still very much unclear. As you [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1678.8600000000001s)]
*  said, the White House is somewhat in a wait and see pattern. They [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1682.74s)]
*  are obviously in close touch with Israel because they were [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1685.9s)]
*  participating. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1688.46s)]
*  They're about to know why we don't have free health care. I [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1689.14s)]
*  know, man. Yeah, you're right. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1691.26s)]
*  Will the White House get a head totally as to when he just like [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1692.82s)]
*  the Ansar Allah administration in Yemen found out right is an [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1695.54s)]
*  open question. No one really knows that's why they're [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1698.82s)]
*  lobbying of like hypersonic missiles in the Tel Aviv. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1700.82s)]
*  In that strike on that building that they own on you dog. That [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1704.74s)]
*  is an own on you and all of us you understand that right? Like [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1709.1399999999999s)]
*  the idea that like we don't have health care. Is that an [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1713.4199999999998s)]
*  acceptable trade off? Are you insane? Why are you openly [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1715.82s)]
*  saying that and you're championing it that [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1719.58s)]
*  originated that originated like that and others over that [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1722.1s)]
*  statement originated as a as a like as a angry thing like people [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1726.82s)]
*  used to say that is like, how dumb is it that we don't have [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1733.26s)]
*  health care because we're just like always funding more [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1736.22s)]
*  missiles. That's the joke. Come on man is oldest line. I mean, it [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1738.82s)]
*  depends. Some can't tell a joke is got to be a joke. Okay, first [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1742.58s)]
*  of all, you can joke about this. I'm just saying that like a lot [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1746.38s)]
*  of people, a lot of people don't make that as a joke in the sense [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1749.8200000000002s)]

*  everybody like, and it still doesn't work. You know what I [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1763.6200000000001s)]
*  mean? Human needs 9 billion yet we send another 9 billion in [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1767.14s)]
*  shipments to Israel. Yes, dude. Are you anti semitic? Are you [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1770.5400000000002s)]

*  hurricane assistance, but directly to the region so we can [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1783.98s)]

*  statements. Look, look, listen. Look at the iron dome is for is [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1819.6999999999998s)]
*  tinier missiles in general. Okay, the iron dome is is a more [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1830.1s)]
*  comprehensive like the anti ballistic system is called [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1835.46s)]
*  arrow. Okay. And that when people say iron dome colloquially, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1838.22s)]
*  they mean like all of the Israeli defense structure, not [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1843.7s)]
*  just the Tamir interceptors. Okay, but it's actually arrow, I [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1847.58s)]
*  think like arrow one through three, like David's sling, I [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1851.94s)]
*  think is another one like there's a bunch of different. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1855.62s)]
*  There are a bunch of different anti missile systems that Israel [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1858.06s)]
*  has. It's very comprehensive. It's very large. And beyond [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1862.02s)]
*  that, beyond its capabilities of like intercepting, they also [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1867.46s)]

*  Jordan, Jordan has defense capabilities as well. You have [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1884.66s)]

*  and very expensive structure to keep Israel safe. And, and, you [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1899.3000000000002s)]

*  attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective. This [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1951.34s)]
*  was first and foremost, the result of the professionalism of [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1954.74s)]
*  the IDF, but in no small part because of the skilled work of [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1957.58s)]
*  the US military and meticulous joint planning in anticipation [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=1961.3s)]

*  service members in the region. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2013.02s)]
*  And with that, I'll take just a few questions. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2014.4199999999998s)]
*  Thanks, Jay. Is the administration making any [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2016.5s)]
*  preparations to evacuate US citizens from Lebanon or [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2019.98s)]
*  elsewhere in the region? [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2023.1s)]
*  We have been very clear for some time now that US citizens should [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2024.3s)]
*  avail themselves of commercial means to depart Lebanon given [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2028.46s)]
*  everything that's going on. We have said that from this podium, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2032.38s)]
*  from multiple podiums. We continue to say that, but we have [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2035.34s)]
*  not begun triggering a non combat emergency evacuation, a [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2038.3s)]
*  NEO. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2043.94s)]
*  You used to be honest when you didn't know things, but your [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2044.74s)]
*  react queen mentality is taken over, especially regarding the [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2047.3799999999999s)]
*  Middle East. You've become the Pied Piper for Russian bots and [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2050.14s)]
*  ignorant. You've fallen off, my dude. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2052.62s)]
*  Guidance from the State Department, which is to find [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2054.7s)]
*  civilian commercial means to depart. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2058.8199999999997s)]
*  Once again, I think chatters don't listen to the words that [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2061.14s)]
*  are coming out of my mouth and simply basically respond to what [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2064.1s)]
*  they assume I'm saying. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2067.74s)]
*  Israel should retaliate. And what is your concern about this [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2068.98s)]
*  leading to a wider escalation of war in the region? [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2071.7s)]
*  We had some initial discussions with the Israelis in the [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2075.7400000000002s)]
*  aftermath of this at the military level and also at the [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2079.1000000000004s)]

*  those conversations in the hours ahead. I'm not going to [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2085.7000000000003s)]
*  prejudge or get ahead of anything. We want to have some [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2088.2200000000003s)]
*  deep consultations with the Israelis and I'll have more to [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2090.38s)]
*  report to you after we get the opportunity for deeper [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2092.94s)]
*  discussions. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2096.0600000000004s)]
*  And escalation in the region? [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2096.7400000000002s)]
*  Obviously, this is a significant escalation by Iran, a [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2098.42s)]
*  significant event, and it is equally significant that we were [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2101.5800000000004s)]
*  able to step up with with Israel and create a situation in [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2105.1s)]
*  which no one was killed in this attack in Israel so far as we [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2108.7799999999997s)]
*  know at this time. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2112.38s)]
*  We are now going to look at what the appropriate next steps are [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2113.58s)]
*  to secure first and foremost American interests and then to [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2116.94s)]

*  forward. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2122.94s)]
*  Yeah, he said no civilians and no military hardware. What do [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2123.3399999999997s)]
*  you mean he's not lying? [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2125.66s)]

*  Oh, sorry. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2127.66s)]
*  I thought he said no civilians were harmed in this process. I [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2129.46s)]
*  don't disagree with that. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2132.98s)]
*  I mean, I don't think that that assessment is a lie. Listen, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2134.34s)]
*  Israel cannot keep it a secret if their civilians die in any [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2138.18s)]
*  kind of attack. And also, it would not even be in their [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2142.7s)]
*  interest to keep that a secret. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2145.38s)]
*  It would give more righteous cause to whatever they're going [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2147.26s)]
*  to do next, okay, in retaliation. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2149.58s)]
*  But in terms of the military hardware, they will absolutely [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2154.14s)]
*  say, Oh, nothing happened. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2157.34s)]
*  We didn't even get a dent. They won't openly admit that their [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2159.38s)]
*  military hardware was destroyed. So just so you understand, do I [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2162.06s)]
*  believe that there was no military hardware destroyed? I [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2167.54s)]
*  don't necessarily believe that. I think that, you know, if they [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2170.38s)]
*  if they actually struck targets directly right here, if this if [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2173.46s)]
*  this footage is correct, if this footage is correct, and you're [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2178.1s)]
*  going to get like very limited information from Israel on this [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2182.74s)]
*  stuff, because like they don't want this kind of information. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2185.62s)]
*  They do not want this kind of information to be out. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2189.22s)]
*  Controversial documentation of missile drops. This is from con [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2192.18s)]
*  news. You know, like Israel does not want Israel does not want [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2195.14s)]
*  direct targets. Okay, Israel does not want video footage of [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2200.98s)]
*  direct targets being hit because it destroys. It absolutely [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2205.58s)]
*  destroys the air of security that they must maintain. Okay, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2210.58s)]
*  October seven was obviously devastating for the Israeli [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2214.2599999999998s)]
*  consciousness Israeli psyche in general, because any kind of any [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2218.54s)]
*  kind of reminder that that Israel is not impenetrable shakes [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2223.7799999999997s)]
*  the collective psyche and causes people to recalculate how Israel [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2229.7s)]
*  operates in the region causes Israeli society to recalculate [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2235.7s)]
*  how Israel operates in the region. So what ends up [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2239.06s)]
*  happening in this situation, obviously, after October seven, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2241.9s)]
*  it was an enemy that they know how to deal with, right? It's an [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2245.62s)]
*  enemy that they have destroyed time and time again, it's [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2248.62s)]
*  broadly civilians. It's not like as powerful of a force as Iran [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2251.78s)]
*  is. Right. So for them, that was like, oh, these are our, you [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2256.9s)]
*  know, ancient enemies at this point. It's great, we can go and [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2261.58s)]
*  siege Gaza, and we can mow the lawn in these operations that [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2265.34s)]
*  we've conducted time and time again. So people were screaming [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2269.02s)]
*  bloody murder. In terms of going into Lebanon, the calculation is [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2272.1s)]
*  a little different again, because once again, Hezbollah is a [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2276.94s)]
*  more significant military presence with better weapons. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2281.86s)]
*  They're more, they're more combat trained, they are not [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2286.14s)]
*  stuck inside of an open air prison that Israel has designed, [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2289.3s)]

*  say controversial. It says Arara, which is a Palestinian [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2296.78s)]

*  anyway, I know I might be fed up false information, but it seems [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2546.06s)]
*  like from the interception of Israel, all of the surrounding [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2549.38s)]

*  the inception of Israel surrounding countries hate it so [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2562.02s)]

*  Think about it further. Like how Israel became a nation state is [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2567.66s)]
*  exactly why a lot of the other countries in the region think [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2572.62s)]
*  that it is a it is a force of evil in the region. And Israel [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2576.5s)]
*  has given plenty of evidence that, you know, it really it [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2581.62s)]
*  truly is October seven and October 1st are the only two [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2584.42s)]
*  days on the calendar. I mean, this isn't as big of a of a [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2587.82s)]
*  considering the fact that considering the fact that, you [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2592.14s)]
*  know, the the Iranian retaliation was limited to [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2596.98s)]
*  military targets and other areas not often protected by the [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2601.86s)]
*  Iron Dome. I don't think that this is going to be considered [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2606.18s)]
*  in the same vein as like October seven Pentagon is going live. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=2610.5s)]

*  to continue certainly for you okay let's hear what essentially [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3317.42s)]
*  a follow up to that question is the US willing to strike Iran [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3321.46s)]
*  in response to this are you are you putting that on or off the [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3324.1s)]
*  table well look aren't it again I don't want to get into [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3327.02s)]
*  hypotheticals I think I was very clear at the top that should US [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3329.86s)]
*  forces be targeted by Iran or its proxies will take necessary [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3335.18s)]
*  steps to defend our people and I think we've also been very [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3338.98s)]
*  clear that we're going to support the defense of Israel [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3342.2599999999998s)]
*  and so not going to get into theoretical or speculative [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3346.74s)]
*  operations at this stage other than to say you know we mean [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3351.2599999999998s)]
*  what we say and we say what we mean and then what the follow [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3355.18s)]
*  up question Iran claims to have used a new missile which is [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3357.8199999999997s)]
*  supposed to be a hypersonic ballistic missile can you assess [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3361.66s)]
*  whether they did use new and advanced weaponry in this attack [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3364.3399999999997s)]
*  and whether they learn from the April attack again we're still [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3368.14s)]
*  assessing the attack and the outcomes and so you know we may [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3371.1s)]
*  have more to provide later but I don't have anything on that [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3374.66s)]
*  right now Dan thanks for your time two questions please on [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3377.18s)]
*  secretary Austin statement last night he referred to being [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3381.7799999999997s)]
*  supportive of operations along the border is he open to Israel [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3385.98s)]
*  using operations on both sides of the border along the border [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3391.58s)]
*  was a little vague there well I think I'd go back to how I [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3395.1s)]
*  responded to Joseph right we understand and support Israel's [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3398.2599999999998s)]
*  right to defend itself against Hezbollah as we highlighted in [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3403.18s)]
*  the readout we understand that part of that is dismantling some [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3406.42s)]
*  of the attack infrastructure that has been has built along [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3409.66s)]
*  the border certainly again we don't want to see this you know [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3413.7799999999997s)]
*  broadening a wider regional conflict but we understand [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3417.94s)]
*  again that that what Israel is doing are limited operations to [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3420.42s)]
*  destroy that attack infrastructure and then enable [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3425.46s)]
*  citizens on both sides of the border to to return home [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3429.9s)]
*  ultimately at the end of the day we do think that a diplomatic [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3434.42s)]
*  resolution is the only way to achieve lasting stability and [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3437.26s)]
*  security across the Israel Lebanon border so you know we're [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3440.7000000000003s)]
*  going to continue to work to that end but we also again [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3443.54s)]
*  understand Israel's need to defend itself [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3446.14s)]
*  the State Department read out a report on a attack on diplomatic [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3450.54s)]
*  facility at Baghdad airport last night have you seen any other [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3455.2999999999997s)]
*  attacks on U.S. forces I guess since Friday this one would seem [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3459.2599999999998s)]
*  to be on a diplomatic facility but be it in the last day [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3464.46s)]
*  particularly at this heightened time of tension or just broadly [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3467.9s)]
*  over the last couple days yeah as of right now I'm not aware of [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3471.2599999999998s)]
*  any additional attacks thanks sir the iron dome how effective [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3474.18s)]
*  is it against ballistic missiles and some of the televised [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3479.3399999999997s)]
*  images appeared to show some of them landing on infrastructure [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3483.2599999999998s)]
*  are you aware of that in general was this attack more effective [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3487.58s)]
*  than the Iranian attack in April again understanding that a lot [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3492.06s)]
*  of still you know very initial as I highlighted initial [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3496.42s)]
*  indications are that there was minimal damage on the ground you [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3500.94s)]
*  know in terms of the specifics that would have to refer you to [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3504.14s)]
*  Israel really to talk through that and again is more [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3506.7400000000002s)]
*  information comes in will certainly no more but the initial [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3509.42s)]
*  assessment is that Israel was able to successfully defend [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3514.14s)]
*  itself of course with the support from the U.S. and so again [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3518.6600000000003s)]
*  we may have more later on that we I thanks Pat I just want to [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3523.86s)]
*  be clear because it seems like it's we're at a very dangerous [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3527.7s)]
*  time where any kind of ambiguity from the U.S. could lead to an [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3530.54s)]
*  attack on American troops and when you say we I understand [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3534.5s)]
*  what you say that we're going to defend any attack on American [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3539.3799999999997s)]
*  troops I also understand that no American that you said that no [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3541.8999999999996s)]
*  American troops were hurt therefore are you saying the U.S. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3544.7799999999997s)]
*  is not planning on a kinetic strike against Iran because [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3547.5s)]
*  right will stress again that Hamas has below partnership only [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3551.2599999999998s)]
*  started out to the second Rabin administration kidnapped and [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3554.8999999999996s)]
*  reported hundreds of Hamas activists is my honey among them [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3557.02s)]
*  across the Lebanese border in 1994 will also remind people [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3560.26s)]
*  that in 1992 Israel assassinated Hezbollah general [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3563.02s)]
*  secretary Abbas Massawi replaced by Nasrallah shortly [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3565.46s)]
*  after God it seems like maybe this more force thing is not [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3568.54s)]
*  the solution to literally everything yeah one thing I want [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3571.7s)]
*  to also point out is that this is like didn't get a lot of [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3574.62s)]
*  coverage but like Israel obviously doesn't just [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3577.38s)]
*  assassinate like the Islamist fundamentalist leading the helm [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3579.78s)]
*  in the resistance group okay a lot of people will be like oh [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3584.86s)]
*  these are not good guys Hassan and it's like yeah you want to [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3587.9s)]
*  know why because Israel killed all the good guys that weren't [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3590.5s)]
*  even fighting against Israel like Gus on kind of Pheney who [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3594.34s)]
*  is not even a person that held a weapon at any point and him and [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3597.94s)]
*  his entire family were ruthlessly slaughtered by [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3602.2599999999998s)]
*  Israel Israel also literally assassinated on the 29th of [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3604.1s)]
*  September multiple PFLP and DFLP commanders that were not [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3609.06s)]
*  participating in the strikes on northern Israel at all they were [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3615.38s)]
*  assassinated because they were Palestinian leaders living in [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3619.62s)]
*  Lebanon and it didn't even get any coverage people go oh my God [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3622.9s)]
*  why aren't there any like secular Marxist leaders or [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3628.2999999999997s)]
*  whatever it's because Israel kills them all the time okay the [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3630.58s)]
*  only one the only ones who end up surviving this kind of based [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3634.58s)]
*  happen to be some of the biggest fundamentalist where does Iran [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3639.06s)]
*  stand now you don't get to choose who gets to resist [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3642.74s)]
*  against Israel's incredibly violent increasingly blood [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3645.5s)]
*  thirsty actions I mean that's really just Israel is setting [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3649.78s)]
*  the standard for Iran you know as evidenced by this attack you [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3652.54s)]
*  know they certainly maintain the capability to conduct totally [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3657.86s)]
*  taupe from Hassan highlighted at the top your understanding of [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3660.54s)]
*  complex geopolitical things that are happening in real time [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3663.62s)]
*  and all the death and destruction that is accompanying [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3666.58s)]
*  that in real time is just cope of a twitch streamer or [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3668.74s)]
*  something Israel should they I don't know what to tell you do [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3672.7s)]
*  just open up your eyes the reality you know have to be [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3675.18s)]
*  prepared in that eventuality it's weird I think you said [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3678.2599999999998s)]
*  earlier this is twice as it's a very weird way to look at [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3681.22s)]
*  them interpret events yeah it's about twice as large in terms of [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3684.02s)]
*  the number of ballistic missiles that they launched from the [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3690.2599999999998s)]
*  was their intent to actually do damage this time well you know [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3693.74s)]
*  look you don't launch that many missiles at a target without [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3697.54s)]
*  the intent of hitting something so absolutely just like the [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3702.2599999999998s)]
*  last time their intent is to cause destruction and so [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3706.98s)]
*  fortunately you know Israel has very significant air defense [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3714.06s)]
*  capabilities and the US of course played a role in in [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3718.06s)]
*  helping on that front as well thank you Matt thanks Pat you [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3720.94s)]
*  said there's been no new attacks on US forces in the [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3724.9s)]
*  region but is the department tracking a greater threat now [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3727.2200000000003s)]
*  to US forces and are you taking any extra measures on top of [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3731.62s)]
*  the recent plus ups you've done for force protection well now [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3735.1800000000003s)]
*  I mean we're as you know we're always taking force protection [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3739.7000000000003s)]

*  tensions in the region and US Central Command has been for a [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3745.7000000000003s)]
*  long time now you know constantly assessing and [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3749.9s)]
*  reassessing the threat to ensure that our forces are [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3752.9s)]
*  protected like I mentioned I'm not aware as I come to the [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3755.7000000000003s)]
*  podium I'm not aware of any additional attacks beyond the [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3758.86s)]
*  the one that that Dan mentioned but it's something that will [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3762.1800000000003s)]
*  obviously be you know keeping a close eye on to protect our [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3766.6600000000003s)]
*  forces secondly were there any other nations other than the [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3770.14s)]
*  United States and Israel who took part in intercepting [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3773.58s)]
*  missiles or helping to track them or anything like that yeah [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3776.46s)]

*  wouldn't speak for other countries from here sir you [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3782.82s)]
*  know Moen Rabani Trita Parsi Finkelstein another regional [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3785.58s)]
*  experts have said that Israel's bent on war with Iran during [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3789.14s)]
*  this election cycle and Biden's lame duck period I expect [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3791.3s)]
*  they'll take this opportunity to bring that to fruition yes [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3793.5s)]
*  part of the reason I think that Iran has been insanely [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3796.7400000000002s)]
*  restrained and this is not just my estimation I know people [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3801.94s)]
*  say like oh Hassan you're biased in the matter or whatever this [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3804.74s)]
*  is the estimation of like the American State Department as [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=3808.1s)]

*  had a relatively restrained approach after the first Iranian [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=5004.54s)]
*  retaliation so that's probably the expectation provoked attacks [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=5008.179999999999s)]

*  possible military move might be taken by Hamas or any Palestinian [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=5069.18s)]
*  armed group in the Gaza Strip they attacked in fact in the [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=5073.3s)]
*  past couple of hours anyone is moving close to Nizri [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=5076.9s)]

*  but people generally understand that that's what it is I think [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=5098.700000000001s)]
*  trigger more huge Israeli response to that attack which can [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=5103.02s)]
*  really give a clear sign that the entire region always open a [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=5107.58s)]
*  knife each that can lead to a very enough on all out war in the [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=5111.9800000000005s)]

*  thousand six hundred people killed in a year of fighting. I [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=5139.06s)]
*  suppose with the war now broadening out into Lebanon with [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=5144.42s)]
*  it potentially broadening even further as you say into a [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGLsTrkcek&t=5149.22s)]
