*  instead of flying. We had too much gear, so I thought it would be because of the amount [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=112.16000000000001s)]
*  of gear that we have. I thought we would need to fly in. But honestly, it's just you still [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=118.56s)]

*  All right. Especially while I'm trying to conduct the interview with someone who's running [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=196.92s)]
*  for mayor. Anyway, but yeah, concrete jungle where dreams are made of it's New York is [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=201.28s)]

*  we slammed this stuff into the bags, break down the equipment, put it into the appropriate [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=226.22s)]
*  places, call an Uber, get to the Dulles airport. And while I'm getting to the Dulles airport [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=231.96s)]
*  and I'm thinking in my thinking of myself, like, did I forget some I feel like I definitely [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=238.48000000000002s)]
*  forgot something turns out I did my Apple Air Max pros. That's like what $500 down the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=243.4s)]
*  drain. Why did I just catch a stray with the I've been good. So good. Do you marches? What [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=249.88s)]
*  did I even say? Oh, wake March's ass up, bro. You were literally sleeping on stream. Yeah, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=255.12s)]
*  on the way to the goddamn airport. My, my phone notifies me that the Apple Air Max pros [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=262.0s)]
*  are left. They're not in my, in my vicinity anymore. I'm like, Jesus Christ. I start calling [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=271.36s)]
*  the hotel on the way over to the airport. We can't even get back because then we'll [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=277.16s)]
*  miss the flight. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=281.88s)]
*  Cause it's like, it's far away enough that if we had turned back and then if we were [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=283.04s)]
*  turned back and then went back to the airport, I would have missed it. We missed the flight. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=292.0s)]
*  So in this economy in the Trump tariff economy, especially losing Apple Air Pat, AirPod Pro [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=295.56s)]
*  Max's bro, that's like, that's not even like $500 no more. That's like, that's like $500,000. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=303.72s)]

*  the process. I'm like, I would rather die than raw dog a flight. So I went and get these [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=352.56s)]
*  like JBL headphones cause there's no Apple certified. Like there's no, all the stores [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=357.64000000000004s)]

*  I'm planning something for you guys like a fun IRL before the Zoran interview. So I think you guys might [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=846.8s)]
*  appreciate it. But let's get it started. We got a lot of news. We got a lot of news to talk about. The [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=851.8s)]
*  world is crumbling. I don't know if we can work ourselves in the near future. Yeah, you can. That's crazy. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=857.8s)]
*  What do you mean? If you can't work on yourself, you can't work on others. Remember that. Hold on. She [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=865.8s)]
*  yeah. Yeah. She goes. Why is he not coming up on my Oh, because it's also G. Okay. Get in. So I normed [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=871.8s)]
*  Finkelstein at the march yesterday. Wait, he was in DC or was he in New York? Norm was at the march. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=879.8s)]
*  He was around me. He was in my physical presence. I could have linked up with him. He was behind you. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=886.8s)]
*  No, he was at 5501. Why did you guys leave so early? What do you mean? We didn't leave early. What is [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=892.8s)]
*  the is that just Maga brain rot or cope? My Maga mom says good the stock market is crashing because I'll be [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=897.8s)]
*  able to buy a house like more buying opportunities because the market is in the toilet. Yeah, no, that is [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=902.8s)]
*  copium. It's also it doesn't make any sense. Like not only is it copium, but it also does not make any [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=907.8s)]
*  what like it's not even copium in the direction of like something something that is tangible. All right. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=915.8s)]
*  Anyway. Yeah, that's it. We're live. We're alive. I'm blasted. I blasted the frick off. Did Trump see your [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=923.8s)]
*  speech? Yeah, totally. He was golfing and he was in the midst of golfing. He was he was watching me. He's a [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=931.8s)]
*  big he's a big Hassan Abiy head. We're blasting off. Ladies and gentlemen, that's not how the market works. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=939.8s)]
*  Golf fashions are so economically illiterate. No, I mean, if you pop the housing bubble or if you like [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=945.8s)]
*  actually destabilize the housing market, you could potentially make houses more affordable. But that's not [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=951.8s)]
*  what Donald Trump is doing. It's affordable, ironically enough, because the actions that he's taking [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=956.8s)]
*  broad sweeping tariffs make the raw materials necessary for building homes more costly. Therefore, making it [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=961.8s)]
*  less likely to build new units. So it's he's burning the candle from both ends. It's just God, every part of [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=967.8s)]
*  this decision structure is so stupid. I don't even know how to describe it. You know, I just I've been trying. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=975.8s)]
*  I've been trying my very best. Are you linking with Sam Seder? Sam Seder is an adult with kids and a life. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=983.8s)]
*  He is not I'm not I can't like just casually hit him up for the 12 hours that I'm in New York City and be like, Hey, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=990.8s)]
*  what are you up to? Let's hang out. OK, I'm brace is not in the city today. He's leaving. He's afraid he's afraid of being [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=998.8s)]
*  around me. I think I asked Brace to it's the weekend chat. I'm I'm one of the only I'm I think a lot of you have a [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=1005.8s)]
*  lot of your brains have broken because I stream seven days a week. So you assume every person out there is also streaming [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=1015.8s)]
*  seven days a week or working seven days a week. A lot of adults don't do that. A lot of normal people don't do that. I'm just [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=1024.8s)]
*  letting you know. You know, that's not the case. Brace thinks you can go a little too far on Twitter. Yeah, that's probably [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=1031.8s)]
*  what it is. The weekend content route. Ah, what the concept of a life is foreign to us. Don't worry. It's foreign to me, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=1036.8s)]
*  too. In any case, folks, we are live. We are alive. Did the Macy's send a playlist? Because if not, I'm just going to, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=1043.8s)]
*  I'm going to get started. But first and foremost, there's, there's something that in this, in the economic crisis that we [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=1051.8s)]
*  are facing, there is one person that has learned things. And that person is cutie Cinderella. Cutie Cinderella posted also [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=1061.8s)]
*  reporting live from the Abbey after checking Robin Hood. Once news like this reaches Twink's, it means we are close to the Great [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=1071.8s)]
*  Depression, close to a Great Depression. Talk about how like Twink's are asking about the market, the market [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=1076.8s)]
*  instabilities. Claire says, can someone explain what this and the economy means in League of Legends terms? Health pods now [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=1083.8s)]
*  costs 1300. You have to choose between that and BF sword. And you really need both. But when you kill a minion, you only get [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=1089.8s)]
*  one gold now. And there aren't enough minions in the game to ever afford both. What? I don't even know if that makes sense. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=1096.8s)]
*  Yeah. The Twink index is a recession indicator. That's for real. That's true. As an absolute certainty. Why is a popular [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=1103.8s)]
*  liver sponsor terrorist? Well, even if we had domestic manufacturing capabilities, we deported all the hard workers that [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=1111.8s)]
*  should have driving me and saying like, how was that your position on this? I mean, there's truth to that because here's here, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=1115.8s)]
*  here are a couple of problems that a lot of people refuse to recognize. Okay. Domestic manufacturing with higher with higher [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=1122.8s)]
*  labor costs with higher wages in general is going to increase costs across the board. It'll give people more purchasing [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=1129.8s)]
*  power, but it will certainly increase costs in the process. It's about how you manage that when you make a major transition like [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=1138.8s)]
*  that. Even if we did have the American manufacturing capabilities, you would have to ensure that corporations don't erroneously raise [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=1146.8s)]
*  their prices in an effort to maintain their profit margins. But corporations love increasing their profit margins or maintaining [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=1156.8s)]
*  their profit margins. And therefore if American manufacturing is more costly because you're using American employees and they [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=1165.8s)]
*  demand higher wages understandably and in that process, they're just going to either a raise the prices in spectacular fashion or eat away [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=1175.8s)]
*  at their profit margins and keep prices relatively affordable while paying their workers more. Obviously under capitalism, this is [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=1185.8s)]
*  never going to happen. They just won't do that unless actually they just won't do that in general because labor has the power to dictate [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=1193.8s)]
*  their wages through collective bargaining agreements and through demonstrating labor power in general. Having said that, however, pricing power is still in the hands of [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=1202.8s)]
*  capital and therefore they will, they will just increase the prices. There's not much you can do unless you regulate it somehow at the federal level. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=1211.8s)]
*  Look at this. This is how you talk to a woman. May Musk, sad, but true race replying to me. Most confession. I desire your ancient body in unusual ways. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=1222.8s)]
*  Feeling embarrassment at being vulnerable here. Solution to old fashions and one old woman braces, braces, revitalized posting in a very unique way. Yeah. I like to think that this is actually Liz [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=1236.8s)]
*  posting all of this. That's the big reveal. The big reveal of all of this is going to be that it's actually not brace. Belden. That's been posting this stuff, but actually Liz Franza. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=1250.8s)]
*  It's not, it's not young Chomsky. It's not brace. It's actually Liz that's been posting this kind of stuff. Yeah. Brace one on bad house Brown and it was revitalized. He commented that the fire had withered. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=1261.8s)]
*  He's back. Do you think your Iranian Uber driver is going to be okay? I think nothing about his life is okay. BBC just tiptoeing around, huh? Dude, I know the, the command over the English language that these guys demonstrate whenever they want to talk about [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=1274.8s)]
*  Israel doing something horrifying never ceases to amaze me. I saw a title. I saw an article headline. We're going to talk about this in a second. I saw an article headline that was so insane that it just wasn't even English anymore. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=1292.8s)]
*  It wasn't even the English language anymore. It was just something different. It had, it took a life of its own. Hold on. Let me see if I can find it. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=1312.8s)]
*  But yeah, the Iranian Uber got no Shaddam is backing him up. You know what I mean? No Shaddam is backing his ass up. Where is it? Where is it? Oh, damn it. There was one title that was just like the most in. Oh dude, this [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=1325.8s)]
*  is [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9l4DlX2Wo&t=1342.8s)]
