# A Memorable Start To The New Year By Hasan  | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [January 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg)
*  I will tell you what I did right after though. I left literally 10 minutes, like 12 Oh eight [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=0.0s)]
*  is when I left the party. I was like, that's it. I've done my obligation. I did my service. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=6.72s)]
*  I socialize with people. Cutie Cinderella can attest to that. I did my very best in [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=14.1s)]
*  socializing with people. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=21.12s)]
*  I just want to wish everybody a Happy New Year regardless. I ended the broadcast and [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=28.22s)]
*  what did I do after into the broadcast? I went to hang out with my mom, my grandparents, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=32.9s)]
*  uncle, shaky, Gerga and the family were there as well. Okay, I went there and I consumed [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=40.82s)]
*  an incredible amount of cookies, absolutely breaking my diet on the last night of the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=48.42s)]
*  year, which is fine. Sometimes it's okay to have a little bit of fun that way. They had [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=55.22s)]
*  delicious cookies. They had like a like a cookie that had like Krispy Kreme style. It [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=61.26s)]
*  was like a regular cookie, but it had like a Krispy Kreme inside. There's a Krispy Kreme. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=66.02s)]
*  No rice Krispy treat inside like marshmallow rice Krispy treat inside and also Eminem. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=71.46000000000001s)]
*  The like Eminem chocolate chips. It was insane. It's like one of the craziest cookies I've [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=78.06s)]
*  ever had. It was a absolute banger. Anyway, destroyed the diet last night. That's fine. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=83.92s)]
*  Had some butteck as well, but it is what it is. It's the new year after all, not the end [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=89.84s)]
*  of the world to have a little bit of fun that way. Okay, no diets in 2025. Yeah, that's [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  you're crazy. I am continuing my same. I'm continuing the same. I've been I'm on my same [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=105.28s)]
*  journey. I shouldn't say no more saying we're not saying we're saying poop now in 2025. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=112.64s)]
*  That's what I'm doing. Yes. I am aware that there was a cyber truck explosion that took [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=118.88s)]
*  place in Trump Hotel in Las Vegas outside of Trump Hotel in Las Vegas. We will talk [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=123.1s)]
*  about all of that. Okay. But yeah, personal news wise, after after a brief stint with [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=129.76s)]
*  playing this game called like the Hue color Hue guessing game, which I don't fully understand [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=138.48000000000002s)]
*  because it incentivizes everyone playing poorly. Like one person picks a card and they try [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=144.32000000000002s)]
*  to tell you things without using colors without saying colors. They try to tell you what the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=154.0s)]
*  color is and the Hue it Hughes and Q's I guess is the name of the game. Now, I feel like [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=158.96s)]
*  the game in and of itself is interesting because it's for graphics designers. Well, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=165.44s)]
*  the game itself is interesting because it incentivizes you to lie and do a bad job. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=171.52s)]
*  I feel like so that people can't figure out exactly what the color is. And then and then [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=176.72s)]
*  that way you sneakily have an advantage hoping that other people are more charitable. Other [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=184.32s)]
*  people are good natured. Having said that, however, having said that, however, nah, the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=189.28s)]
*  reader gets points for everyone that also does guessing. Wait, really? Maybe they didn't [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=194.32s)]
*  understand the rules that well then. All right, whatever. I left that to go to Ethan's house. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=198.64s)]
*  He was throwing a New Year's Eve party and let me tell you, let me tell you. Okay. I went there [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=205.2s)]
*  and I did something that I think is the most boomer thing anyone has ever done in the history of [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=213.6s)]
*  boomer. Okay. Ethan Nestor conflict resolution. Let's go. I think in 2025, we're also going to [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=221.11999999999998s)]
*  try to be less stupid. How about that as a community? I think in 2025, we're just going to [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=228.79999999999998s)]
*  be less stupid in general. How does that sound good? Can we be less stupid? I'm already cursing. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=234.95999999999998s)]
*  It's a I'm going to stop cursing. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. No, I didn't spend New Year's with a guy who's [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=241.83999999999997s)]
*  you know, been calling me a radical terrorism supporter and an ass right. That's incredible. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=249.6s)]
*  It's impossible for this community to be less stupid. We're it's going to, it's going to happen. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  We're going to have stupidity no matter what unfiltered stupidity. So brother, I got kicked [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=261.12s)]
*  in the head by a horse. I'm not getting less dumb in 2025. Sorry. Yeah. No less stupidity, more [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=267.52s)]
*  smarty. Okay. But yeah, here it is, you know, brought it in, brought the new year in. We made [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=273.6s)]
*  it. We made it alive, which is good. I will tell you what I did right after though. I left [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=280.48s)]
*  literally 10 minutes, like 12 Oh eight is when I left the party. I was like, that's it. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=287.36s)]
*  I've done my obligation. I did my service. I socialize with people. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=293.6s)]
*  Cutie Cinderella can attest to that. I did my very best in socializing with people. Cutie [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=300.96s)]
*  Cinderella can attest to that as well. She was, she was there. Okay. She saw me trying my best. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=307.12s)]
*  And then after, after socializing, I left at like 12 Oh eight so that I could get back home. Cause [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=314.08s)]
*  Ethan Nestor lives fairly far from me. So I knew that there was going to be a treacherous journey [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=321.59999999999997s)]
*  ahead. I knew that it was going to take quite some time to get back home to sleep at a reasonable [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=330.0s)]
*  hour. I also knew that if I had left early, like right after the tide, right after 12, the streets [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=334.4s)]
*  would be empty. And I was right. The streets were empty. Okay. It's perfect. I identify so hard with [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=342.4s)]
*  that decision. Yeah. Do you game of socialization? Cause I do. And I'm not on the, I am not diagnosed [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=349.92s)]
*  awesome, but I got higher score than you. Yeah. Well, regardless, regardless, I went back home. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=355.36s)]
*  I passed out instantly woke up and because it was the new year and it's like kind of the, the end of, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=361.68s)]
*  I feel like January 1st is the last day of the holiday season. Instead of waking up at 7 AM or [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=368.40000000000003s)]
*  6 AM as I always do. I woke up at nine. I slept in, which is why I'm late this morning because I [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=374.64s)]
*  slept in. I woke up, I played basketball. Here we are normalized, not identifying people by make [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=382.64s)]
*  belief score in 2025. God damn chat. I don't even know what you guys are talking about. Oh, you fell [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=390.56s)]
*  off. Yes. I fell. I fell off question mark. Yes. I guess I did. New year knew me for real. No new [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=395.84000000000003s)]
*  year old me. That is something that is something that I will always maintain. Okay. You can expect [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=402.96s)]
*  Instagram fit checks and, and fitness cardio videos. And also for me to be live, usually every [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=410.96s)]
*  single day, usually around 11 AM Pacific, sometimes a little bit later. Okay. So new year, same old, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=418.47999999999996s)]
*  I mean, listen, a lot of people went out, they drank. I didn't drink at all. I drove. I didn't [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=427.2s)]
*  want to drunk drove. So I didn't drink and I drove and I went to sleep early and I woke up relatively [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=433.52s)]
*  early and I went and I did the same thing that I always do. Part of that is going to tie into [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=440.88s)]
*  my new year's resolutions and the concept of new year's resolutions in general, because a lot of [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=448.96s)]
*  people place a lot of emphasis on the tide shift, the change of time. And they believe that this [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=454.0s)]
*  will be the primary motivator for them. And I don't discount that because I'm a, I'm forever [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=461.52s)]
*  an advocate for change. I'm forever an advocate for growth. I'm always an advocate for self [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=469.28s)]
*  improvement. I drove too. I didn't drink though. I don't know how you do it. Okay. Connor, he had [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=476.08s)]
*  that on last night guys. Oh yeah. Thank you, Connor. So my point is, my point is I promise you, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=481.04s)]
*  Hey, I promise you, Hey, cuck philosophy had a video on two philosophical perspectives on [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=489.44s)]
*  new year's resolutions. This is the nerdiest way to tackle the subject matter. You don't need to [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=495.12s)]
*  start a diet on a Monday. You don't need to start your fitness journey or a new hobby that you want [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=498.88s)]
*  to tackle on the first day of the year. Okay. You don't have to do any of that. You just have [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=505.12s)]
*  to start doing it and you have to keep repeating it develops into a healthy habit. This is something [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=510.8s)]
*  that has been very instructive, informative and very helpful in my life. This is how I, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=516.5600000000001s)]
*  at the age of 33 can continue achieving goals that I set for myself with decent success [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=523.28s)]
*  and stay consistent in spite of everything else. And having said that, don't get discouraged if [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=534.4s)]
*  this is your time and your opportunity, if this is the year where you're going to tackle some goals [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=540.96s)]
*  that you have, so you don't keep any new year's resolutions. No, I don't have any real new year's [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=545.44s)]
*  resolutions. I just do it as content on stream, but almost every single year, and this is what my [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=552.08s)]
*  seventh year, I'm not seventh year doing new year's resolutions, but like it's my sixth year [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=558.0s)]
*  doing new year's resolutions. I always bring up the fact that new year's resolutions are not the [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=566.64s)]
*  most stable way to try and make changes in your life considering that it gives you like a little [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=573.52s)]
*  boost upfront where you think, oh, I'm going to use this as an opportunity to make a significant [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=580.56s)]
*  change in my life. And then a lot of people by the end of January, people just kind of give up [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=586.08s)]
*  on that stuff. My point is you don't have to wait for a Monday. You don't have to wait for the new [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=591.5200000000001s)]
*  year, but if that is what gets you started, then that's great, but just keep to it, stick to it, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=596.72s)]
*  try to overcome the first three weeks of consistency. Okay. That's it. This is you [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=605.6s)]
*  right now. Happy new year. Actually the year is an arbitrarily defined construct. So I mean, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=611.84s)]
*  that is how I am, but also I will say this. I will say this. Yeah. The year is, it is arbitrary. It's [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=616.0s)]
*  like nothing changes. Nothing's different from yesterday to today, but I don't know. I don't [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=626.24s)]
*  know what I'm saying. I hate January because the gym gets packed and I got to wait on the machine [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=632.4s)]
*  and benches more. Yeah, it's fine. What beer trimmer do you use to establish and hone the beer stash? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=635.2800000000001s)]
*  I don't know. It's some Phillips one. It's like a, it's like a highlighter green yellowish color [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=640.56s)]
*  and black and may I got some of your mergers too fat to fit it and made a goal to have the [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=646.0s)]
*  shirt fit by January 1st. And I tried it on this morning and it's kind of baggy. Hell yeah. Chatter. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=649.76s)]
*  That's what I'm talking about. There was another thing that I was going to say, but I'm forgetting [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=653.8399999999999s)]
*  it now. I started my finished journey last May after being inspired by you in this community. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=663.76s)]
*  My resolution is to continue that journey. Thank you. Hell yeah. Having said that, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=667.44s)]
*  we will still do some goals and predictions for the upcoming year. As always, you already know [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=670.5600000000001s)]
*  what it is. You know, I'm going to, I'm going to keep doing the stuff that people enjoy and, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=675.5200000000001s)]
*  you know, entertain that stuff. Obviously. All right. We will talk about the truck explosion, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=683.6800000000001s)]
*  which is pretty crazy outside of Trump tower. Hold on. I'm down 14 pounds since September. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=690.72s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7oqDTJlYg&t=698.16s)]
