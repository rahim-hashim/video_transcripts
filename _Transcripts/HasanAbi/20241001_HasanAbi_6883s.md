**HasanAbi:** [October 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw)

*  80% Americans. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  But let's go back to this on immigration. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=10.56s)]
*  80 to 90% of drug apprehensions are American citizens. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=12.52s)]
*  She's the only person in this race. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=15.56s)]
*  He's repeating Kamala Botstein's! [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  But look, we all want to solve this. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=22.84s)]
*  It's the bot time. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=30.88s)]
*  It's coming up. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=32.4s)]
*  It's coming up. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=33.08s)]
*  It's coming up. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=33.68s)]
*  It's the bot. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=34.28s)]
*  It's the bot. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=35.0s)]
*  It's the bot. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=35.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=36.84s)]
*  Per time. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=37.2s)]
*  Are you guys ready? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=37.68s)]
*  I think Tim Walz has been neutered. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=39.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=41.4s)]
*  Tim Walz has been neutered. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=42.4s)]
*  I think that Tim Walz is not going to have as strong of a showing as I suspect him to. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=45.08s)]
*  Tim Walz was, Tim Walz has been packaged. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=54.16s)]
*  He's been, he's been pack watched. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=55.04s)]
*  He's been packaged. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=57.16s)]
*  He's been compromised. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=58.839999999999996s)]
*  He is no longer the secret Somali. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=60.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  My goat is washed. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=63.879999999999995s)]
*  My goat has lost his sauce. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=65.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=68.56s)]
*  Adult circumcision time for Tim Walz. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  It happened. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=71.24s)]
*  Now, what do I mean by this? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=72.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=74.2s)]
*  What do I mean by this? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=74.67999999999999s)]
*  This came in and he came in and he came out. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=76.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=80.88s)]
*  He popped off. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=81.19999999999999s)]
*  He single-handedly brought forward an incredibly solid. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=82.28s)]
*  He told Kamala he's a bad debater. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=86.47999999999999s)]
*  Camp is leaking to the press that he's nervous. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=88.0s)]
*  You know, that could be to like, that could be to ease people's expectations or set [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=91.36s)]
*  expectations low, but also not only is he a bad debater and he might be nervous. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=95.76s)]
*  I do personally think, I do personally think that like JD Vance is definitely a solid attack [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  dog because he's the disgusting person. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=110.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=113.6s)]
*  He is a disgusting person. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=114.28s)]
*  He is a moral. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=116.03999999999999s)]
*  He is a bloodless soulless career is little rat monster. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=117.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=122.44s)]
*  And much like Pete Buddha judge, that type of person does fairly well in debates. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=123.48s)]
*  You got to be like a sociopath. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=129.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=132.32s)]
*  Many politicians are, I don't think Tim Walz is okay. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=133.0s)]
*  He doesn't have that smoke. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=136.12s)]
*  You know, who else didn't have that smoke, even though he's a good guy. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=137.32s)]
*  And I'm not even like comparing them in terms of their ideology, but Bernie Sanders, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=139.72s)]
*  Bernie Sanders, great dude overall, not a good debater. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  He was way too, way too limited in his lines of attacks. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=150.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=155.39999999999998s)]
*  And Tim practice with Mayo P, but it don't matter. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=156.04s)]
*  It does not matter. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=159.56s)]
*  My point is, my point is he's too nice. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=160.76s)]
*  I think. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=164.32s)]
*  And beyond that, more importantly, Tim Walz was a very good communicator of, of even [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=165.0s)]
*  Kamala Harris's dog policies. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=172.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=174.16s)]
*  But ever since the rollout, they've kind of, they've kind of put him on the back [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=175.64000000000001s)]
*  burner. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=180.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=181.44s)]
*  They've kind of basically cast them aside. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=182.68s)]
*  They're like, all right, Tim. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=185.48000000000002s)]
*  All right, Timmy, Timmy two time chilled out. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=189.12s)]
*  And I personally think that given the reality that Tim already is like nice, not a [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=189.8s)]
*  very good debater. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=198.12s)]
*  And also on top of that, the fact that he's like basically rate limited, having to [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=199.96s)]
*  defend Kamala's dog policies. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=205.32s)]
*  That's a triple Monte you don't want to be on. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=207.64s)]
*  Now on the other side, on the other side, you have Jedidiah Don Vance, JD Vance, who [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=209.72s)]
*  is patently unlikable, gross, disgusting, amoral, freakish monster. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=217.0s)]
*  Looks like a German boy whose lollipop fell on the floor and their ants covering it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=223.96s)]
*  He always is out there looking like mine, Loli, like that's what he looks like. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=229.36s)]
*  He's nasty. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=234.0s)]
*  He's got eyeshadow. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=235.12s)]
*  Nobody likes to look at him. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=236.56s)]
*  Everyone's like, bro, you stop. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  Can I not look at you, please? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=240.48s)]
*  Even Trump looks sexier than JD Vance. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=242.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=245.88s)]
*  Anyway, JD Vance has that working against them. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=248.68s)]
*  JD Vance also disgusting podcast monster. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=252.56s)]
*  You know, just has is also like has this like nervous energy. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=256.52000000000004s)]
*  His real nervous, like, please like me type energy that he has, I think comes across as [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=261.8s)]
*  really gross. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=269.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=270.64000000000004s)]
*  On the other hand, it seems that Lena Hobbott was JD Vance's debate coach. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=271.32s)]
*  So I don't know if this is real or not, but if it is real, he will take L for sure. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=276.72s)]
*  I mean, that's crazy. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=282.52000000000004s)]
*  JD Vance is like Jeb Bush, but less sad. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=284.32s)]
*  Yeah, he just he's just gross. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=286.4s)]
*  He sucks. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=288.59999999999997s)]
*  He is a brown noser through and through. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=290.03999999999996s)]
*  I don't think Americans like that type of thing. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=293.79999999999995s)]
*  Overall, I think JD Vance being the gross little piglet that he is, is going to attack [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=296.84s)]
*  Tim Walz mercilessly. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=307.03999999999996s)]
*  And maybe Tim Walz will be able to just showcase how weird that is. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=308.88s)]
*  And if he can do that, then he'll come across unscathed. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=313.6s)]
*  But if he can't do that, and he's rate limited by Kamala's policies, and he doesn't have [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=316.72s)]
*  a firm grasp of what's in front of him, then he's absolutely cooked. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=322.2s)]
*  And by cooked, I mean, ultimately, it doesn't matter because the VP debates are the most [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=326.88s)]
*  inconsequential thing. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=331.68s)]
*  I'll be honest with you. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=333.16s)]
*  Like this is there's not a lot of motion here. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=334.4s)]
*  Okay, there's not a lot of motion here. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=337.4s)]
*  There's not a lot of movement. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=339.68s)]
*  There's not a lot of momentum. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=341.16s)]
*  I think the Kamala momentum is gone. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=342.64s)]
*  As I said, it would go away post DNC, especially. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=344.68s)]
*  I think it just like boom, stop that dead in his tracks. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=348.32s)]
*  That's why you haven't seen like enough movement in the polls. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=351.24s)]
*  I don't know if the media will be gracious enough not to bring up Israel or at least [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=355.44s)]
*  the Iranian attacks. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=360.47999999999996s)]
*  They probably have to. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=361.56s)]
*  I mean, that's a huge story in terms of foreign policy, but maybe they'll abide by the [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=362.8s)]
*  uniparty principle there and ask it in a way that is like favorable to both parties. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=368.72s)]
*  I can see people considering them more consequential than usual because Trump is [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=375.0s)]
*  brainless. So Vance is thought as the brains of the operation and Harris didn't get a [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=379.08s)]
*  primer. So Waltz is the new blood, new quantity that people are interested in. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=382.24s)]
*  Do you think people are that interested in it? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=385.64s)]
*  I mean, this is a VP debate and there's only seventy six thousand people in here that [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=387.64s)]
*  are waiting for it. You know, which which which is the original stream, the OG stream, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=391.48s)]
*  I guess there's three hundred and sixty eight thousand watching on CBS. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=396.76000000000005s)]
*  So that's you know, there's a lot of people watching. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=399.56s)]

*  Minnesota's Democratic Governor Tim Walz and Ohio's Republican Senator J.D. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=466.71999999999997s)]

*  CBS News reserves the right to mute the candidates' microphones to maintain decorum. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=509.56s)]
*  We have not shared the questions or topics with the campaigns. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=514.24s)]
*  The stage is set. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=517.56s)]
*  Governor, Senator, thank you for joining us. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=519.0799999999999s)]
*  Let's get started. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=522.16s)]
*  Tonight, our country is facing several unfolding crises. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=523.76s)]
*  The Middle East is on the brink of war. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=526.68s)]
*  Americans are suffering from the catastrophic impact of Hurricane Helene. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=528.72s)]
*  And now a labor has 25000 dock workers from Maine to Texas are picketing. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=532.72s)]
*  We're going to begin tonight with the Middle East. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=537.92s)]
*  Margaret, thank you, Nora. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=540.28s)]
*  Earlier today, Iran launched its largest attack yet on Israel. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=541.92s)]
*  But that attack failed thanks to joint U.S. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=545.96s)]
*  and Israeli defensive action. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=549.64s)]
*  President Biden has deployed more than 40000 U.S. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=551.68s)]
*  military personnel and assets to that region. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=555.16s)]
*  Thank God. The past year to try to prevent a regional war. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=558.24s)]
*  Thank God. Iran is weakened, but the U.S. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=561.8s)]
*  still considers it the largest state sponsor in the world, and it has [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=564.8399999999999s)]
*  drastically reduced the time it would take to develop a nuclear weapon. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=568.5999999999999s)]
*  It is down now to one or two weeks time. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=572.92s)]
*  Governor Walz, if you were the final voice in the situation room, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=576.8s)]
*  would you support or oppose a preemptive by Israel on Iran? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=581.28s)]
*  You have two minutes. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=586.12s)]
*  Well, thank you. And thank you for those joining home tonight. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=587.12s)]
*  Let's keep in mind where this started. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=590.16s)]
*  October 7th, Hamas. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=592.0799999999999s)]
*  Massacred over 1400 Israelis and took prisoners. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=595.28s)]
*  Iran or Israel's ability [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=598.9599999999999s)]
*  to be able to defend itself is absolutely fundamental. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=602.3599999999999s)]
*  Getting its hostages back. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=604.76s)]
*  No. And ending the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=606.92s)]
*  But the expansion of Israel and its proxies is an absolute fundamental [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=612.88s)]
*  necessity for the United States to have the steady leadership there. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=617.8399999999999s)]
*  You saw it experienced today, where along with our Israeli [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=620.4799999999999s)]
*  partners and our coalition, able to stop the incoming attack. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=624.36s)]
*  But what's fundamental here is that steady leadership is going to matter. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=628.72s)]
*  It's clear and the world saw it on that debate stage a few weeks ago. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=632.52s)]
*  A nearly 80 year old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=636.64s)]
*  is not what we need in this moment. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=640.2s)]
*  But it's not just that. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=642.44s)]
*  It's those that were closest to Donald Trump that understand [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=643.96s)]
*  how dangerous he is when the world is this dangerous. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=647.28s)]
*  His chief of staff, John Kelly, said that he was the most flawed [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=650.24s)]
*  human being he'd ever met. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=653.48s)]
*  And both of his secretaries of defense [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=654.96s)]
*  and his national security advisors said he should be nowhere near the White House. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=658.4s)]
*  Now, the person closest to them, to Donald Trump, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=663.4s)]
*  said he's unfit for the highest office. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=668.0s)]
*  That was Senator Vance. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=670.44s)]
*  What we've seen out of Vice President Harris is we've seen steady leadership. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=671.9200000000001s)]
*  We've seen a calmness that is able to be able to draw on the coalitions [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=676.8000000000001s)]
*  to bring them together, that our allies matter. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=680.68s)]
*  When our allies see Donald Trump. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=684.0s)]
*  Turn towards Vladimir Putin, turn towards North Korea. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=688.88s)]
*  When we start to see that type of fickleness around holding the coalitions together, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=693.56s)]
*  we will stay committed. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=697.68s)]
*  And as the vice president said today is, we will protect our forces [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=699.4s)]
*  and our allied forces, and there will be consequences. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=703.12s)]
*  Governor, your time is up. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=706.4799999999999s)]
*  Senator Vance, the same question. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=707.5999999999999s)]
*  He didn't even bring up Palestinians. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=709.32s)]
*  He's bad. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=711.44s)]
*  Israel on Iran. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=713.12s)]
*  You have two minutes. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=714.44s)]
*  So, Margaret, I want to answer the question. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=715.5600000000001s)]
*  First of all, thanks, Governor. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=717.08s)]
*  Thanks to CBS for hosting the debate. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=718.5600000000001s)]
*  And thanks, most importantly, the American people who are watching this evening [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=720.2s)]
*  and caring enough about this country to pay attention to this vice [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=723.24s)]
*  presidential debate. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=725.7600000000001s)]
*  I want to answer the question, but I want to actually give an introduction [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=726.9200000000001s)]
*  to myself a little bit because I recognize a lot of Americans [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=729.24s)]
*  don't know who either one of us are. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=731.36s)]
*  I was raised in a working class family. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=733.2s)]
*  My mother had food assistance for periods of her life. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=735.0400000000001s)]
*  My grandmother required Social Security help to raise me, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=737.64s)]
*  and she raised me in part because my own mother struggled with addiction [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=740.6s)]
*  for a big chunk of my early life. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=743.6s)]
*  I went to college on the GI Bill after I enlisted in the Marine Corps [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=745.36s)]
*  and served in Iraq. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=749.08s)]
*  And so I stand here asking to be your vice president with extraordinary [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=750.08s)]
*  gratitude for this country, for the American dream that made it possible [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=753.52s)]
*  for me to live my dreams. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=756.76s)]
*  And most importantly, I know that a lot of you are worried about the chaos [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=758.4s)]
*  in the world and the feeling that the American dream is unattainable. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=762.28s)]
*  I want to try to convince you tonight over the next 90 minutes that if we [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=766.08s)]
*  get better leadership in the White House, if we get Donald Trump back in [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=769.0400000000001s)]
*  the White House, the American dream is going to be attainable once again. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=772.6s)]
*  Now, to answer this particular question, we have to remember that as much [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=776.08s)]
*  as Governor Walz just accused Donald Trump of being an agent of chaos, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=779.36s)]
*  Donald Trump actually delivered stability in the world, and he did it [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=782.88s)]
*  by establishing effective deterrence. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=786.0s)]
*  People were afraid of stepping out of line. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=788.76s)]
*  Iran, which launched this attack, has received over $100 billion in unfrozen [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=791.28s)]
*  assets thanks to the Kamala Harris administration. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=796.64s)]
*  What do they use that money for? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=799.4399999999999s)]
*  They use it to buy weapons that they're now launching against our allies. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=800.4399999999999s)]
*  And God forbid, potentially launching against the United States as well. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=803.76s)]
*  Donald Trump recognized that for people to fear the United States, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=807.68s)]
*  you needed peace through strength. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=811.6s)]
*  They needed to recognize that if they got out of line, the United States [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=813.16s)]
*  global leadership would put stability and peace back in the world. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=816.92s)]
*  Now, you asked about a preemptive, Margaret, and I want to answer the question. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=820.9599999999999s)]
*  Look, it is up to Israel what they think they need to do to keep their country safe. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=823.76s)]
*  And we should support our allies wherever they are when they're fighting the bad guys. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=828.24s)]
*  I think that's the right approach to take with the Israel question. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=832.0799999999999s)]
*  Thank you, Senator. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=835.4399999999999s)]
*  Governor Walz, do you care to respond to any of the allegations? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=836.5999999999999s)]
*  Well, look, Donald Trump was in office. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=840.04s)]
*  We'll sometimes hear a revisionist history. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=842.0s)]
*  But when Donald Trump was in office, it was Donald Trump who we had a coalition [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=843.92s)]
*  of nations that had boxed Iran's nuclear program in, the inability to advance it. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=848.68s)]
*  Donald Trump pulled that program and put nothing else in its place. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=854.5999999999999s)]
*  So Iran is closer to a nuclear weapon than they were before [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=858.3599999999999s)]
*  because of Donald Trump's fickle leadership. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=861.2399999999999s)]
*  And when Iran shot down an American aircraft in international airspace, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=863.4799999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump tweeted because that's the standard diplomacy of Donald Trump. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=868.16s)]
*  And when Iranian missiles did fall near U.S. troops [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=872.4399999999999s)]
*  and they received traumatic brain injuries, Donald Trump wrote it off as headaches. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=877.5999999999999s)]
*  Look, our allies understand that Donald Trump is fickle. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=883.16s)]
*  He will go to whoever has the most flattery or where it makes sense to him. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=887.1199999999999s)]
*  Steady leadership like you witnessed today, like you witnessed in April. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=891.1999999999999s)]
*  Both Iranian attacks were repelled. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=895.0799999999999s)]
*  Our coalition is strong and we need the steady leadership that Kamala Harris is providing. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=897.4399999999999s)]
*  Senator Vance, the U.S. did have a diplomatic deal with Iran [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=902.7199999999999s)]
*  to temporarily pause parts of its nuclear program. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=906.7199999999999s)]
*  And President Trump did exit that deal. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=909.64s)]
*  He recently said, just five days ago, the U.S. must now make a diplomatic deal with Iran [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=913.12s)]
*  because the consequences are impossible. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=920.1999999999999s)]
*  Did he make a mistake? You have one minute. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=923.9599999999999s)]
*  Well, first of all, Margaret, diplomacy is not a dirty word. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=925.9599999999999s)]
*  But I think that's something that Governor Walz just said is quite extraordinary. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=928.56s)]
*  You yourself just said Iran is as close to a nuclear weapon today as they have ever been. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=931.28s)]
*  And Governor Walz, you blame Donald Trump. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=936.64s)]
*  Who has been the vice president for the last three and a half years? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=938.64s)]
*  And the answer is your running mate, not mine. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=941.1999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump consistently made the world more secure. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=943.76s)]
*  Now, we talk about the sequence of events that led us to where we are right now. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=947.6s)]
*  And you can't ignore October the 7th, which I appreciate Governor Walz bringing up. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=952.72s)]
*  But when did Iran and Hamas and their proxies attack Israel? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=957.32s)]
*  It was during the administration of Kamala Harris. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=961.32s)]
*  So Governor Walz can criticize Donald Trump's tweets. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=964.1600000000001s)]
*  But effective, smart diplomacy and peace through strength is how you bring stability back to a very broken world. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=967.48s)]
*  Donald Trump has already done it once before. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=974.5600000000001s)]
*  Ask yourself, when was the last time, I'm 40 years old, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=976.5600000000001s)]
*  when was the last time that an American president didn't have a major conflict break out? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=981.1600000000001s)]
*  The only answer is during the four years that Donald Trump was president. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=985.5999999999999s)]
*  Gentlemen, we have a lot to go to. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=988.8s)]
*  I hate that. I hate that a lot. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=990.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=991.4s)]
*  Let's turn now to Hurricane Helene. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=992.4799999999999s)]
*  The storm could become one of the deadliest on record. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=994.56s)]
*  More than 160 people are dead and hundreds more are missing. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=998.0799999999999s)]
*  Scientists say climate change makes these hurricanes larger, stronger and more deadly because of the historic rainfall. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1003.52s)]
*  Senator Vance, according to CBS News polling, 7 in 10 Americans and more than 60 percent of Republicans under the age of 45 favor the U.S. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1012.76s)]
*  taking steps to try and reduce climate change. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1022.72s)]
*  Senator, what responsibility would the Trump administration have to try and reduce the impact of climate change? [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1025.48s)]
*  I'll give you two minutes. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1033.04s)]
*  Sure. So, first of all, let's start with the hurricane, because it's an unbelievable, unspeakable human tragedy. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1034.04s)]
*  I just saw today actually a photograph of two grandparents on a roof with a six-year-old child, and it was the last photograph ever taken of them because the roof collapsed and those innocent people lost their lives. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1039.3999999999999s)]
*  And I'm sure Governor Walz joins me in saying our hearts go out to those innocent people, our prayers go out to them, and we want as robust and aggressive as a federal response as we can get to save as many lives as possible. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1049.52s)]
*  And then, of course, afterwards, to help the people in those communities rebuild. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1061.0s)]
*  I mean, these are communities that I love. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1064.4799999999998s)]
*  Some of them I know very personally in Appalachia all across the southeast. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1065.76s)]
*  They need their government to do their job. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1069.92s)]
*  And I commit that when Donald Trump is president again, the government will put the citizens of this country first when they suffer from a disaster. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1072.04s)]
*  Now, Norah, you asked about climate change. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1079.4s)]
*  I think this is a very important issue. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1081.04s)]
*  Look, a lot of people are justifiably worried about all these crazy weather and patterns. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1082.76s)]
*  I think it's important for us, first of all, to say Donald Trump and I support clean air, clean water. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1086.92s)]
*  We want the environment to be cleaner and safer. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1091.72s)]
*  But one of the things that I've noticed, some of our Democratic friends talking a lot about, is a concern about carbon emissions, this idea that carbon emissions drives all of the climate change. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1093.8s)]
*  Well, let's just say that's true just for the sake of argument. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1103.28s)]
*  So we're not arguing about weird science. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1105.56s)]
*  Let's just say that's true. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1107.32s)]
*  Well, if you believe that, what would you what would you want to do? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1108.84s)]
*  The answer is that you'd want to reshore as much American manufacturing as possible and you'd want to produce as much energy as possible in the United States of America, because we're the cleanest economy in the entire world. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1111.8799999999999s)]
*  What have Kamala Harris's policies actually led to? [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1123.0s)]
*  More energy production in China, more manufacturing overseas, more doing business in some of the dirtiest parts of the entire world. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1126.0s)]
*  And when I say that, I mean the amount of carbon emissions they're doing per unit of economic output. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1133.32s)]
*  So if we actually care about getting cleaner air and cleaner water, the best thing to do is to double down and invest in American workers and the American people. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1138.4s)]
*  And unfortunately, Kamala Harris has done exactly the opposite. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1147.0s)]
*  Governor Walz, you have two minutes to respond. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1150.8400000000001s)]
*  Well, we got close to an agreement because all those things are happening. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1152.68s)]
*  Look, first of all, it is a horrific tragedy with this hurricane. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1155.64s)]
*  And my heart goes out to the folks that are down there in contact with the governors. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1160.92s)]
*  I serve as co-chair of the Council of Governors. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1165.28s)]
*  We work together on these emergency managements. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1168.96s)]
*  Governors know no partisanship. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1170.8s)]
*  They work together to solve the governors and the emergency responders on the ground. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1172.72s)]
*  Those happen on the front end. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1176.48s)]
*  The federal government comes in, make sure they're there to that we recover. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1178.3200000000002s)]
*  But we're still in that phase where we need to make sure that they're staying there, staying focused. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1181.28s)]
*  Now, look, coming back to the climate change issue, there's no doubt this thing roared onto the scene faster and stronger than anything we've seen. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1185.52s)]
*  Senator Vance has said that there's a climate problem in the past. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1192.56s)]
*  Donald Trump called it a hoax and then joked that these things would make more beachfront property to be able to invest in. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1195.12s)]
*  What we've seen out of the Harris administration now, the Biden Harris administration, is we've seen this investment. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1201.84s)]
*  We've seen massive investments. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1207.84s)]
*  The biggest in global history that we've seen in the Inflation Reduction Act has created jobs all across the country. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1209.3999999999999s)]
*  Two thousand in Jeffersonville, Ohio, taking the EV technology that we invented and making it here. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1216.12s)]
*  Two hundred thousand jobs across the country. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1221.72s)]
*  The largest solar manufacturing plant in North America sets in Minnesota. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1224.12s)]
*  But my farmers know climate change is real. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1228.48s)]
*  They've seen 500 year droughts, 500 year floods back to back. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1230.76s)]
*  But what they're doing is adapting. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1234.48s)]
*  And this has allowed them to tell me, look, I harvest corn, I harvest soybean, and I harvest wind. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1236.04s)]
*  We are producing more natural gas and more oil at any time than we ever have. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1241.24s)]
*  We're also producing more clean energy. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1245.1200000000001s)]
*  So the solution for us is to continue to move forward that climate change is real. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1247.8400000000001s)]
*  Reducing our impact is absolutely critical. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1253.92s)]
*  But this is not a false choice. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1256.56s)]
*  You can do that at the same time you're creating the jobs that we're seeing all across the country. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1258.52s)]
*  That's exactly what this administration has done. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1263.12s)]
*  We are seeing us becoming an energy superpower for the future, not just the current. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1265.4399999999998s)]
*  And that's what absolutely makes sense. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1270.04s)]
*  And then we start thinking about how do we mitigate these disasters? [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1272.04s)]
*  Thank you, Senator. I want to give you an opportunity to respond there. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1276.9199999999998s)]
*  The governor mentioned a little bit better Trump has called climate change a hoax. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1279.96s)]
*  Do you agree? Well, look, what the president has said is that if the Democrats, in particular, Kamala [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1283.84s)]
*  Harris and her leadership, if they really believe that climate change is serious, what they would be [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1289.48s)]
*  doing is more manufacturing and more energy production in the United States of America. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1293.88s)]
*  And that's not what they're doing. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1298.1200000000001s)]
*  So clearly, Kamala Harris herself doesn't believe her own rhetoric on this. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1299.48s)]
*  If she did, she would actually agree with Donald Trump's energy policies. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1303.72s)]
*  Now, something Governor Walz said is important to touch upon, because when we talk about clean energy, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1306.92s)]
*  I think that's a slogan that often the Democrats will use here. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1312.6s)]
*  I'm talking, of course, about the Democratic leadership. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1316.2s)]
*  And the real issue is that if you're spending hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1318.52s)]
*  of American taxpayer money on solar panels that are made in China, number one, you're going to make [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1323.4s)]
*  the economy dirtier. We should be making more of those solar panels here in the United States of [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1328.52s)]
*  America. Some of them are, Tim, but a lot of them are being made overseas in China, especially the [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1332.3600000000001s)]
*  components that go into those solar panels. So if you really- Be like, yo, your people don't want [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1337.3200000000002s)]
*  the Green New Deal. Suck my- ... more energy production. We haven't built a nuclear facility, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1342.2s)]
*  I think, one in the past 40 years. Natural gas, we got to invest more in it. Kamala Harris has [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1345.88s)]
*  done the opposite. That's raised energy prices and also meant that we're doing more by the climate. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1351.24s)]
*  Senator, your time is up. Governor, would you like to respond? [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1354.92s)]
*  Well, look, we're producing more natural gas than we ever have. There's no moratorium on that. We're [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1358.1200000000001s)]
*  producing more oil. But the folks know, and like I said again, these are not liberal folks. These [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1362.5200000000002s)]
*  are not folks that are Green New Deal folks. These are farmers that have been drought one year, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1367.88s)]
*  massive flooding the next year. They understand that it makes sense. Look, our number one export [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1373.0s)]
*  cannot be topsoil from erosion from these massive storms. We saw it in Minnesota this summer. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1378.68s)]
*  Thinking about how do we respond to that, we're thinking ahead on this. What Kamala Harris has [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1384.44s)]
*  been able to do in Minnesota, we're starting to weatherproof some of these things. The [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1388.92s)]
*  infrastructure law that was passed allows us to think about mitigation in the future. How do we [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1392.84s)]
*  make sure that we're protecting by burying our power lines? How do we make sure that we're [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1397.8s)]
*  protecting lakefronts and things that we're seeing more and more of? But to call it a hoax [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1401.32s)]
*  and to take the oil company executives to Mar-a-Lago, say, give me money for my campaign [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1406.04s)]
*  and I'll let you do whatever you want. We can be smarter about that and an all above energy [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1412.04s)]
*  policy is exactly what she's doing, creating those jobs right here. Governor, your time is up. The [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1416.28s)]
*  overwhelming consensus among scientists is that the Earth's climate is warming at an unprecedented [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1421.48s)]
*  rate. Margaret. Thank you, Nora. We're going to turn now to immigration. The crisis at the U.S.-Mexico [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1426.04s)]
*  border consistently ranks as one of the top issue for American voters. Senator Vance, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1432.36s)]
*  your campaign is pledging to carry out the largest mass deportation plan in American history [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1439.3999999999999s)]
*  and to use the U.S. military to do so. Could you be more specific about exactly how this will work? [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1445.48s)]
*  For example, would you deport parents who have entered the U.S. illegally and separate them from [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1452.76s)]
*  any of their children who were born on U.S. soil? Good question. So first of all, Margaret, before [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1458.68s)]
*  we talk about deportations, we have to stop the bleeding. We have a historic immigration crisis [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1463.96s)]
*  because Kamala Harris started and said that she wanted to undo all of Donald Trump's border policies. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1469.24s)]
*  Ninety-four executive orders suspending deportations, illegal aliens, massively increasing [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1475.8799999999999s)]
*  the asylum fraud that exists in our system, that has opened the floodgates. And what it's meant is [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1482.28s)]
*  that a lot of fentanyl is coming into our country. I had a mother who struggled with opioid addiction [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1487.24s)]
*  and has gotten clean. I don't want people who are struggling with addiction to be deprived of their [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1491.8s)]
*  second chance because Kamala Harris let in fentanyl into our communities at record levels. So you've [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1497.08s)]
*  got to stop the bleeding. To implement Donald Trump's border policies, build the wall, re-implement deportations, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1502.84s)]
*  and that gets me to your point, Margaret, about what do we actually do? So we've got 20, 25 million [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1509.24s)]
*  illegal aliens who are here in the country. What do we do with them? I think the first thing that we [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1514.04s)]
*  do is we start with the criminal migrants. About a million of those people have committed some form of, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1517.88s)]
*  in addition to crossing the border illegally, I think you start with deportations on those folks. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1523.32s)]
*  And then I think you make it harder for illegal aliens to undercut the wages of American workers. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1528.52s)]
*  A lot of people will go home if they can't work for less than minimum wage in our own country. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1533.32s)]
*  And by the way, that'll be really good for our workers who just want to earn a fair wage for doing [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1537.72s)]
*  a good day's work. And the final point, Margaret, is you ask about family separation. Right now in [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1542.04s)]
*  this country, Margaret, we have 320,000 children that the Department of Homeland Security has [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1547.0s)]
*  effectively lost. Some of them have been sex trafficked, some of them hopefully are at homes [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1552.92s)]
*  with their families, some of them have been used as drug trafficking mules. The real family separation [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1557.56s)]
*  policy in this country is unfortunately Kamala Harris's wide-open southern border. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1563.24s)]
*  What? I'd ask my fellow Americans to remember when she came into office, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1568.0400000000002s)]
*  she said she was going to do this. No fact checks. Real leadership would be saying, you know what, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1571.8000000000002s)]
*  I screwed up. No fact checks on this debate, Chad. We're going to go back to Donald Trump's border [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1575.4s)]
*  policies. I wish that she would do that. It would be good for all of us. Governor, do you care to [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1577.72s)]
*  respond to any of those specific allegations, including that the vice president is, quote, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1584.1200000000001s)]
*  letting in fentanyl and using kids as drug mules, among other things regarding children? [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1589.16s)]
*  Yeah, well, the drug mule is not true, but I will say about this, about the fentanyl, [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1595.96s)]
*  because this is a crisis of this, the opioid crisis. And the good news on this is, is the [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1598.68s)]
*  last 12 months saw the largest decrease in opioid deaths in our nation's history. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1602.36s)]
*  On Brian Kilmeade. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1605.72s)]
*  30% decrease in Ohio. But there's still more work to do. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1606.52s)]
*  Say 80% Americans. 80% to 90% of fentanyl. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1608.12s)]
*  Kamala Harris is the attorney general of the largest state of border state in California. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1611.4s)]
*  She's the only person in this race. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1615.4s)]
*  As national gang. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1618.1200000000001s)]
*  He's repeating Kamala's botstakes. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1618.8400000000001s)]
*  But look, we all want to solve this. Most of us want to solve this. And that is the United States [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1621.64s)]
*  Congress. That's the border patrol agents. That's the chamber of commerce. That's most [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1628.3600000000001s)]
*  Americans out here. That's why we have- [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1632.2800000000002s)]
*  They're going to lose, bro. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1634.0400000000002s)]
*  And the toughest bill on immigration- [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1635.0800000000002s)]
*  They're going to lose. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1637.3200000000002s)]
*  That this nation's seen. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1638.44s)]
*  I think they might lose. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1639.3200000000002s)]
*  Crafted by a conservative senator from Oklahoma, James Langford. I know him. He's [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1640.3600000000001s)]
*  Not very consequential, luckily, the VP debate. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1645.0s)]
*  Democrats and Republicans worked on this piece of legislation. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1647.32s)]
*  The border patrols say this is what we need in here. These are the experts. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1650.2s)]
*  And the chamber of commerce in the Wall Street Journal said, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1653.6399999999999s)]
*  pass this thing. Kamala Harris helped get there. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1655.96s)]
*  1500 new border agents. Detection for drugs. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1658.2s)]
*  DOJ money to speed up the adjudications on this. Just what America wants. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1662.6s)]
*  But as soon as I was getting ready to pass and actually tackle this, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1667.8799999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump said no. Told them to vote against it because it gives him a campaign issue. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1671.0s)]
*  It gives him- What would Donald Trump talk about if we actually did some of these things? [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1676.52s)]
*  And they need to be done by the legislature. You can't just do this through the executive branch. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1680.52s)]
*  So look, we have the options to do this. Donald Trump had four years. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1685.72s)]
*  He had four years to do this. And he promised you, America, how easy it would be. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1689.64s)]
*  I'll build you a big, beautiful wall. And Mexico will pay for it. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1694.2s)]
*  Less than 2% of that wall got built and Mexico didn't pay a dime. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1698.2s)]
*  But here we are again, nine years after he came down that escalator. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1701.8799999999999s)]
*  That's your argument? We're going to build the wall? [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1705.32s)]
*  And telling him what he was going to do. As far as the deportation plan, at one point, [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1708.6s)]
*  Senator Vance said it was so unworkable to be laughable. So that's where we're at. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1712.6s)]
*  Pass the bill. She'll sign it. Governor, your time is up. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1717.0s)]
*  He just said we're building the wall and we're deporting. We're the real deporters. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1720.52s)]
*  We ain't fake like these f****** ass lip darts on the Republican Party. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1725.48s)]
*  We already have massive child separations thanks to Kamala Harris' open border. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1729.6399999999999s)]
*  I didn't accuse Kamala Harris of inviting drug mules. I said that she enabled the Mexican drug [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1733.08s)]
*  cartels to operate freely in this country. And we know that they use children as drug mules. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1738.12s)]
*  And it is a disgrace and it has to stop. Children are the best drug mules. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1743.08s)]
*  But I think what Tim said just doesn't pass the smell test. For three years, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1747.6399999999999s)]
*  Kamala Harris went out bragging that she was going to undo Donald Trump's border policy. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1750.6799999999998s)]
*  She did exactly that. We had a record number of illegal crossings. We had a record number [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1755.32s)]
*  of fentanyl coming into our country. And now, now that she's running for president or a few months [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1759.56s)]
*  before, she says that somehow she got religion and cared a lot about a piece of legislation. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1764.36s)]
*  The only thing that she did when she became the vice president, when she became the appointed [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1769.3999999999999s)]
*  border czar, was to undo 94 Donald Trump executive actions that opened the border. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1774.84s)]
*  This problem is leading to massive problems in the United States of America. Parents who can't [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1781.32s)]
*  afford health care, schools that are overwhelmed, it's got to stop and it will when Donald Trump [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1786.84s)]
*  is president again. Senator, your time is up. Governor, what about our CBS News polling, [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1791.0s)]
*  which does show that a majority of Americans, more than 50 percent, support mass deportations? [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1796.9199999999998s)]
*  I hate this debate. It sucks so bad. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1803.24s)]
*  Look, we fix this issue with a bill that is necessary, but the issue on this is, [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1806.28s)]
*  this is what happens when you don't want to solve it. You demonize it. And we saw this, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1808.36s)]
*  and Senator Vinson, it surprises me on this. Talking about and saying, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1812.6799999999998s)]
*  I will create stories to bring attention to this, that vilified a large number of people who were [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1816.4399999999998s)]
*  here legally in the community of Springfield. Why does it matter? You want to build a wall. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1821.48s)]
*  The Republican governor said, it's not true. Don't do it. There's consequences for this. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1825.08s)]
*  We could come together. Senator Langford did it. We could come together and solve this if we didn't [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1830.44s)]
*  let Donald Trump continue to make it an issue. And the consequences in Springfield were, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1835.5600000000002s)]
*  the governor had to send state law enforcement to escort kindergartners to school. I believe [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1840.3600000000001s)]
*  Senator Vance wants to solve this, but by standing with Donald Trump and not working together to find [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1846.3600000000001s)]
*  a solution, it becomes a talking point. And when it becomes a talking point like this, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1851.88s)]
*  we dehumanize and villainize other human beings. Governor, your time is up. Senator, [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1856.36s)]
*  I'll give you one minute, but let me just ask you the question first. The governor has made the [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1863.0s)]
*  point, and I think as a sitting lawmaker, you know that Congress controls the purse strings and any [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1869.0s)]
*  funding. So you have said repeatedly that Donald Trump would, through executive action, solve this. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1874.9199999999998s)]
*  Do you disagree that Congress controls the purse strings and would need to support [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1882.92s)]
*  many of the changes that you would actually want to implement? You have one minute. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1888.52s)]
*  Look, Margaret, first of all, the gross majority of what we need to do at the southern border is [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1892.52s)]
*  just empowering law enforcement to do their job. I've been to the southern border more than our [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1895.88s)]
*  borders are, Kamala Harris has been, and it's actually heartbreaking because the border patrol [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1899.72s)]
*  agents, they just want to be empowered to do their job. Of course, additional resources would help, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1903.72s)]
*  but most of this is about the president and the vice president- [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1908.6000000000001s)]
*  They need a license to kill. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1910.68s)]
*  Empowering our law enforcement to say, if you try to come across the border illegally, [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1911.64s)]
*  you've got to stay in Mexico, you've got to go back through proper channels. Now, Governor [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1915.88s)]
*  Waltz brought up the community of Springfield, and he's very worried about the things that I've said [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1919.64s)]
*  in Springfield. Look, in Springfield, Ohio, and in communities all across this country, you've got [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1925.4s)]
*  schools that are overwhelmed, you've got hospitals that are overwhelmed, you have got housing that [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1931.3200000000002s)]
*  is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1935.8000000000002s)]
*  Americans for scarce homes. The people that I'm most worried about in Springfield, Ohio, [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1940.52s)]
*  are the American citizens who have had their lives destroyed by Kamala Harris's open border. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1945.08s)]
*  It is a disgrace to him, and I actually think, I agree with you, I think you want to solve this [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1950.44s)]
*  problem, but I don't think that Kamala Harris does. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1954.92s)]
*  Senator, your time is up. Governor, you have one minute to respond. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1957.32s)]
*  Yeah, well, it is law enforcement that asked for the bill. They helped craft it. They're the ones [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1960.2s)]
*  that supported it. It was, that's because they know we need to do this. Look, this issue of [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1966.04s)]
*  continuing to bring this up, of not dealing with it, of blaming migrants for everything. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1970.84s)]
*  On housing, we could talk a little bit about Wall Street speculators buying up housing and [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1977.08s)]
*  making them less affordable, but it becomes a blame. Look, this bill also gives the money [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1981.0s)]
*  necessary to adjudicate. I agree, it should not take seven years for an asylum claim to be done. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1987.08s)]
*  This bill gets it done in 90 days. Then you start to make a difference in this, and you start to [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1993.0s)]
*  adhere to what we know, American principles. I don't talk about my faith a lot, but Matthew 2540 [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=1997.56s)]
*  talks about, to the least amongst us, you do unto me. I think that's true of most Americans. They [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2003.88s)]
*  simply want order to it. This bill does it. It's funded. It's supported by the people who do it, [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2009.4s)]
*  and it lets us keep our dignity. Thank God, dude, this bill is approved by [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2015.16s)]
*  Christian God. Just to clarify for our viewers, Springfield, Ohio, does have a large number of [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2019.64s)]
*  Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected status. Well, Mara, but the moderators [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2025.64s)]
*  are helping to move. I think it's important because the rules were that you guys weren't going to [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2032.76s)]
*  fact check, and since you're fact checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2039.0s)]
*  going on. So there's an application called the CBP One App, where you can go on as an illegal [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2043.0s)]
*  migrant, apply for asylum or apply for parole, and be granted legal status at the wave of a [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2048.44s)]
*  Kamala Harris open border wand. That is not a person coming in, applying for a green card, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2056.04s)]
*  and waiting for 10 years. That is the facilitation of illegal immigration, Margaret, by our own [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2061.08s)]
*  leadership. Thank you, Senator, for describing the legal process. We have so much to get to, Senator. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2066.68s)]
*  Those laws have been on the books since 1990. Thank you, gentlemen. The CBP One App has not [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2071.64s)]
*  been on the books. Mute him. Oh, they did. Gentlemen, the audience can't hear you because [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2077.08s)]
*  your mics are cut. We have so much we want to get to. Thank you for explaining the legal process. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2084.12s)]
*  Nora. Thank you, Margaret. The economy is a top concern for voters. Each of your campaigns has [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2089.72s)]
*  released an economic plan, so let's talk about the specifics. Governor Walz, Vice President Harris [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2096.12s)]
*  unveiled a plan that includes billions in tax credits for manufacturing, housing, and a renewed [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2101.16s)]
*  child tax credit. The Wharton School says your proposals will increase the nation's deficit by [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2106.6s)]
*  $1.2 trillion. How would you pay for that without ballooning the deficit? Governor, I'll give you [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2112.12s)]
*  two minutes. Yeah, thank you. And Kamala Harris and I do believe in the middle class because that's [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2118.44s)]
*  where we come from. We both grew up in that. We understand. So those of you out there listening [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2122.92s)]
*  tonight, you're hearing a lot of stuff back and forth, and it's good. It's healthy. That's what [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2126.92s)]
*  this is supposed to happen. You should be listening. How's this going to impact me? [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2130.12s)]
*  The bold forward plan that Kamala Harris put out there is one is talking about this housing issue. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2133.96s)]
*  The one thing is there's three million new houses proposed under this plan [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2139.64s)]
*  with down payment assistance on the front end to get you an house. A house is much more than just [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2143.8s)]
*  an asset to be traded somewhere. It's foundational to where you're at. And then making sure that the [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2148.68s)]
*  things you buy every day, whether they be prescription drugs or other things, that there's [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2153.4s)]
*  fairness in that. Look, the $35 insulin is a good thing, but it costs $5 to make insulin. They were [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2157.56s)]
*  charging $800 before this law went into effect. As far as the housing goes, I've seen it in Minnesota, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2163.4s)]
*  12% more houses in Minneapolis. Prices went down on rent 4%. It's working. And then making sure [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2169.48s)]
*  tax cuts go to the middle class. $6,000 child tax credit, we have one in Minnesota, reduces [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2175.0s)]
*  childhood poverty by a third. We save money in the long run and we do the right thing for families. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2181.1600000000003s)]
*  And then getting businesses off the ground. The laws that stands right now is $5,000 tax credit [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2185.7200000000003s)]
*  for small business, increasing that to $50,000. Now, this is a philosophical difference between [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2190.28s)]
*  us. Donald Trump made a promise and I'll give you this. He kept it. He took folks from Mar-a-Lago, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2194.92s)]
*  said, your riches help me give you a tax cut. He gave the tax cuts that predominantly went to the [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2199.5600000000004s)]
*  top class. What happened there was an $8 trillion increase in the national debt, the largest ever. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2203.4s)]
*  Now he's proposing a 20% consumption or sales tax on everything we bring in. Everyone agrees, [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2209.48s)]
*  including businesses, it would be destabilizing it. It would increase inflation and potentially [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2216.36s)]
*  lead to a recession. Look, this is simple for you. Where are we going? Kamala Harris has said to do [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2220.92s)]
*  the things she wants to do, we'll just ask the wealthiest to pay their fair share. When you do [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2226.36s)]
*  that, our system works best. More people are participating in it and folks have the things [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2230.92s)]
*  that they need. Notice the difference? When he's talking about some mass right-wing border bill [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2236.0400000000004s)]
*  versus this, he comes alive and says it would increase the nation's deficit by 5.8 trillion. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2241.08s)]
*  My question is the same for you. How do you pay for all that without ballooning the deficit? [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2247.72s)]
*  I'll give you two minutes. Well, first of all, a lot from Tim Walz this evening and you just heard [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2252.84s)]
*  it in the answer. A lot of what Kamala Harris proposed us to do and some of it, I'll be honest [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2256.7599999999998s)]
*  with you, it even sounds pretty good. Here's what you won't hear is that Kamala Harris has already [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2261.48s)]
*  done it because she's been the vice president for three and a half years. She had the opportunity [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2266.6s)]
*  to enact all of these great policies and what she's actually done instead is drive the cost [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2271.24s)]
*  of food higher by 25 percent, drive the cost of housing higher by about 60 percent, open the [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2277.24s)]
*  American southern border and make middle class life unaffordable for a large number of Americans. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2283.48s)]
*  If Kamala Harris has such great plans for how to address middle class problems, then she ought to [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2288.6s)]
*  do them now. Not when asking for a promotion but in the job the American people gave her three and [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2293.88s)]
*  a half years ago and the fact that she isn't tells you a lot about how much you can trust [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2299.0s)]
*  her actual plans. Now, Donald Trump's economic plan is not just a plan but it's also a record. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2304.12s)]
*  A lot of those same economists attack Donald Trump's plans and they have PhDs but they don't [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2310.28s)]
*  have common sense and they don't have wisdom because Donald Trump's economic policy- You went [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2314.76s)]
*  to Yale, dipshit. The highest take-home pay in a generation in this country, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2319.16s)]
*  1.5 percent inflation and to boot peace and security all over the world. So when people say [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2323.48s)]
*  that Donald Trump's economic plan doesn't make sense, I say look at the record. He delivered [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2328.92s)]
*  rising take-home pay for American workers. Now, Tim admirably admits that they want to undo the [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2334.2s)]
*  Trump tax cuts but if you look at what was so different about Donald Trump's tax cuts, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2340.2s)]
*  even from previous Republican tax cut plans, is that a lot of those resources went to giving [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2344.44s)]
*  more take-home pay to middle class and working class Americans. It was passed in 2017. That's a [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2349.64s)]
*  lie. And you saw an American economic boom unlike we've seen in a generation in this country. That [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2355.16s)]
*  is a record that I'm proud to run. Go to the QR code to find out. And we're getting back to that [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2360.2000000000003s)]
*  common sense wisdom so that you can afford to live the American dream again. I know a lot of you are [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2363.16s)]
*  struggling. I know a lot of you are worried about paying the bills. It's gonna stop when Donald [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2369.0s)]
*  Trump brings back common sense to this country. Governor, do you want to respond to that? What has [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2373.16s)]
*  Kamala Harris done for the middle class? Yeah, well Kamala Harris's day one was Donald Trump's [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2377.64s)]
*  failure on COVID that led to the collapse for our economy. We were already before COVID in a [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2381.8799999999997s)]
*  manufacturing recession but 10 million people out of work, largest percentage since the Great [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2386.3599999999997s)]
*  Depression. Nine million jobs closed on that. That was day one. Whether it was the Infrastructure [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2390.3599999999997s)]
*  Act or other things we moved. Now you made a question about experts, said this. I've made a [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2395.3199999999997s)]
*  note of this. Economists don't know you can't be trusted. Science can't be trusted. National security [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2399.64s)]
*  folks can't be trusted. Look, if you're going to be president, you don't have all the answers. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2405.96s)]
*  Donald Trump believes he does. My pro tip of the day is this. If you need heart surgery, listen to [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2410.7599999999998s)]
*  the people at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, not Donald Trump. And the same thing [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2416.2s)]
*  goes with this. And I ask you out there, teachers, nurses, truck drivers, whatever, how is it fair [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2420.12s)]
*  that you're paying your taxes every year and Donald Trump hasn't paid any federal tax in the [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2426.2s)]
*  last 15 years? In the last year as president? That's what's wrong with the system. There's a way [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2430.4399999999996s)]
*  around it and he's bragged about that. We're just asking for fairness in it and that's all you want. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2435.56s)]
*  You have a minute. Governor, you say trust the experts but those same experts for 40 years said [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2441.3199999999997s)]
*  that if we shipped our manufacturing base off to China, we'd get cheaper goods. They lied about that. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2446.8399999999997s)]
*  They said if we shipped our industrial base off to other countries, to Mexico and elsewhere, [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2451.64s)]
*  it would make the middle class stronger. They were wrong about that. They were wrong about the idea [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2456.12s)]
*  that if we made America less self-reliant, less self-productive in our own nation, that it would [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2461.24s)]
*  somehow make us better off and they were wrong about it. And for the first time in a generation, [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2466.68s)]
*  Donald Trump had the wisdom and the courage to say to that bipartisan consensus, we're not doing [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2471.56s)]
*  it anymore. We're bringing American manufacturing back. We're unleashing American energy. We're [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2477.64s)]
*  going to make more of our own stuff and this isn't just an economic issue. I've got three [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2482.36s)]
*  beautiful little kids at home, seven, four and two and I love them very much and I hope they're in [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2486.52s)]
*  bed right now. But look, so many of the drugs, the pharmaceuticals that we put in the bodies of our [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2490.36s)]
*  children are manufactured by nations that hate us. This has to stop and we're not going to stop it by [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2495.2400000000002s)]
*  listening to experts. We're going to stop it by listening to common sense wisdom, which is what [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2501.1600000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump governed on. Senator, your time is up. Governor Walz, can you address that? I mean, [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2505.6400000000003s)]
*  voters say they trust Donald Trump on the economy more. Why? If you're listening tonight and you want [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2508.92s)]
*  billionaires to get tax cuts, you heard what the numbers were. Look, I'm a union guy on this. I'm [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2514.36s)]
*  not a guy who wanted to ship things overseas, but I understand that look, we produce soybeans and [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2521.2400000000002s)]
*  corn. We need to have fair trading partners. That's something that we believe in. I think the thing [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2525.8s)]
*  that most concerns me on this is Donald Trump was the guy who created the largest trade deficit in [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2529.96s)]
*  American history with China. So the rhetoric is good. Much of what the Senator said right there, [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2536.68s)]
*  I'm in agreement with him on this. I watched it happen too. I watched it to my communities [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2541.7999999999997s)]
*  and we talked about that. But we had people undercutting the right to collectively bargain. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2545.8799999999997s)]
*  We had right to work states made it more difficult. We had companies that were willing to ship it over [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2551.48s)]
*  and we saw people profit. Folks that are venture capital in some cases, putting money into [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2555.64s)]
*  companies that were overseas. Say it like his daddy. We're in agreement that we bring those home. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2561.72s)]
*  Like his daddy. He's a blood boy for Peter Thiel. Attack him. You fucking pussy. May I respond to [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2565.24s)]
*  that? Yes. Attack him. So if you notice what Governor Walz just did is he said first of all, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2573.0s)]
*  Donald Trump has to listen to the experts. And then when he acknowledged that the experts [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2579.24s)]
*  screwed up, he said, well, Donald Trump didn't do nearly as good of a job as the statistics show [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2582.7599999999998s)]
*  that he did. So what Tim Walz is doing, and I honestly, Tim, I think you got a tough job here [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2587.16s)]
*  because you've got to play whack-a-mole. You've got to pretend that Donald Trump didn't deliver [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2592.36s)]
*  rising take-home pay, which of course he did. You've got to pretend that Donald Trump didn't [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2596.2000000000003s)]
*  deliver lower inflation, which of course he did. And then you simultaneously got to defend Kamala [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2600.1200000000003s)]
*  Harris's atrocious economic record, which has made gas, groceries and housing unaffordable [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2605.48s)]
*  for American citizens. I was raised by a woman who would sometimes go into medical debt so that she [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2611.0s)]
*  could put food on the table in our household. I know what it's like to not be able to afford [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2616.76s)]
*  the things that you need to afford. We can do so much better. To all of you watching, we can get [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2622.1200000000003s)]
*  back to an America that's affordable again. We just got to get back to common sense economic [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2627.4s)]
*  principles. I hope we have a conversation on health care then. Senator, Governor, please. Thank you. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2631.7200000000003s)]
*  Margaret? We have a lot to get to ahead, gentlemen, on many topics. But right now I want to talk about [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2636.5200000000004s)]
*  personal qualifications. The vice president is often the last voice the president hears before [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2643.16s)]
*  making consequential decisions. We want to ask you about your leadership qualities. Governor Walls, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2650.12s)]
*  you said you were in Hong Kong during the deadly Tiananmen Square protests in the spring of 1989. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2657.24s)]
*  But Minnesota Public Radio and other media outlets are reporting that you actually didn't travel to [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2663.56s)]
*  Asia until August of that year. Can you explain that discrepancy? Yeah, well, and to the folks [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2668.84s)]
*  out there who didn't get at the top of this, look, I grew up in small rural Nebraska, a town of 400, [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2675.6400000000003s)]
*  town that you rode your bike with your buddies till the streetlights come on, and I'm proud of [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2682.36s)]
*  that service. I joined the National Guard at 17, worked on family farms, and then I used the GI [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2685.7200000000003s)]
*  bill to become a teacher, passionate about it, a young teacher. My first year out, I got the [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2691.8s)]
*  opportunity in the summer of 89 to travel to China. 35 years ago, be able to do that. I came back home [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2696.76s)]
*  and then started a program to take young people there. We would take basketball teams, we would [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2703.8s)]
*  take baseball teams, we would take dancers, and we would go back and forth to China. The issue for [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2708.76s)]
*  that was to try and learn. Now, look, my community knows who I am. They saw where I was at. They, [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2713.6400000000003s)]
*  look, I will be the first to tell you, I have poured my heart into my community. I've tried to [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2719.96s)]
*  do the best I can, but I've not been perfect, and I'm a knucklehead at times, but it's always been [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2724.68s)]
*  about that. Those same people elected me to Congress for 12 years, and in Congress, I was one of the most [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2729.3999999999996s)]
*  bipartisan people, working on things like farm bills that we got done, working on veterans benefits, [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2736.04s)]
*  and then the people of Minnesota were able to elect me to governor twice. So, look, my commitment [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2741.08s)]
*  has been from the beginning to make sure that I'm there for the people, to make sure that I get this [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2746.68s)]
*  right. I will say more than anything, many times I will talk a lot, I will get caught up in the [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2751.48s)]
*  rhetoric, but being there, the impact it made, the difference it made in my life, I learned a lot [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2757.4s)]
*  about China. I hear the critiques of this. I would make the case that Donald Trump should have come [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2763.0s)]
*  on one of those trips with us. I guarantee you he wouldn't be praising Xi Jinping about COVID, [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2767.48s)]
*  and I guarantee you he wouldn't start a trade war that he ends up losing. So, this is about trying [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2773.56s)]
*  to understand the world. It's about trying to do the best you can for your community, and then it's [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2778.44s)]
*  putting yourself out there and letting your folks understand what it is. My commitment, whether it be [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2783.7200000000003s)]
*  through teaching, which I was good at, or whether it was being a good soldier or was being a good [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2788.04s)]
*  member of Congress, those are the things that I think are the values that people care about. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2792.36s)]
*  Governor, just to follow up on that, the question was, can you explain the discrepancy? [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2797.0s)]
*  All I said on this was, is I got there that summer and misspoke on this, so I will just, [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2802.84s)]
*  that's what I've said. So, I was in Hong Kong and China during the democracy protest, went in, [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2808.12s)]
*  and from that I learned a lot of what needed to be in governance. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2816.44s)]
*  Thank you, Governor. Senator Vance, in 2016 you called your running mate Donald Trump unfit for [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2822.6s)]
*  the nation's highest office, and you said he could be America's Hitler. I know you've said, you've been [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2829.4s)]
*  asked many times, and you've said you regret those comments and explained you then voted for Donald [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2835.0s)]
*  Trump in 2020. But the Washington Post reported new messages last week in which you also disparaged [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2840.2s)]
*  Trump's economic record while he was president, writing to someone in 2020, quote, Trump thoroughly [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2846.36s)]
*  failed to deliver his economic populism. You're now his running mate, and you've shifted many of [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2852.92s)]
*  your policy stances to align with his. If you become vice president, why should Americans trust [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2859.16s)]
*  that you will give Donald Trump the advice he needs to hear and not just the advice he wants to hear? [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2865.48s)]
*  You have two minutes. Well, first of all, Margaret, because I've always been open, and sometimes, of [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2872.68s)]
*  course, I've disagreed with the president, but I've also been extremely open about the fact that I [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2876.44s)]
*  was wrong about Donald Trump. I was wrong, first of all, because I believed some of the media stories [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2880.2799999999997s)]
*  that turned out to be dishonest fabrications of his record, but most importantly, Donald Trump [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2885.24s)]
*  delivered for the American people. Rising wages, rising take-home pay, an economy that worked for [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2889.9599999999996s)]
*  normal Americans, a secure southern border, a lot of things, frankly, that I didn't think he'd be [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2895.8799999999997s)]
*  able to deliver on. And yeah, when you screw up, when you misspeak, when you get something wrong [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2899.9599999999996s)]
*  and you change your mind, you ought to be honest with the American people about it. One of the [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2904.6s)]
*  reasons, Margaret, why I've done so many interviews is because I think it's important to actually [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2907.72s)]
*  explain to the American people where I come down on the issues and what changed. Now, you pointed [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2911.72s)]
*  out to Messages from 2020, Margaret, I've been extremely consistent that I think there were a [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2915.9599999999996s)]
*  lot of things that we could have done better in the Trump administration in the first round [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2920.3599999999997s)]
*  if Congress was doing its job. I strongly believe, and I've been a United States senator, [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2924.4399999999996s)]
*  that Congress is not just a high-class debating society. It's not just a forum for senators and [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2929.3999999999996s)]
*  congressmen to whine about problems. It's a forum to govern. So there were a lot of things on the [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2934.12s)]
*  border, on tariffs, for example, where I think that we could have done so much more if the [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2938.68s)]
*  Republican Congress and the Democrats in Congress had been a little bit better about how they [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2943.08s)]
*  govern the country. They were so obsessed with impeaching Donald Trump, they couldn't actually [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2948.2s)]
*  govern. And I want to talk about this tariff issue in particular, Margaret, because Tim just accused [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2951.7999999999997s)]
*  this of being a national sales tax. Look, the one thing, and you're probably surprised to hear me [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2957.48s)]
*  praising Joe Biden, but the one thing that Joe Biden did is he continued some of the Trump tariffs [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2963.88s)]
*  that protected American manufacturing jobs. And it's the one issue, the most by the administration, [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2969.0s)]
*  it's the one issue where Kamala Harris has run away from Joe Biden's record. Think about this. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2974.36s)]
*  If you're trying to employ in China at three dollars a day, you're going to do that and undercut [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2979.56s)]
*  the wages of American workers unless our country stands up for itself and says you're not accessing [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2984.92s)]
*  our markets unless you're paying middle class Americans a fair wage. Senator, your time is up. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2991.24s)]
*  Nora? Thank you. Now to the issue of reproductive rights. Governor Rawls, after Roe versus Wade was [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=2996.6s)]
*  overturned, you signed a bill into law that made Minnesota one of the least restrictive states in [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3002.52s)]
*  the nation when it comes to abortion. Former President Trump said in the last debate that you [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3008.8399999999997s)]
*  believe abortion, quote, in the ninth month is absolutely fine. Yes or no? Is that what you [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3014.68s)]
*  support? I'll give you two minutes. That's not what the bill says, but look, this issue is what's on [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3021.3199999999997s)]
*  everyone's mind. Donald Trump put this all into motion. He brags about how great it was that he [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3026.9199999999996s)]
*  put the judges in and overturned Roe versus Wade. 52 years of personal autonomy. And then he tells [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3033.72s)]
*  us, oh, we send it to the states. It's a beautiful thing. Amanda Zorsky would disagree with you on [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3039.4s)]
*  it's a beautiful thing. A young bride in Texas waiting for their child at 18 weeks, she has a [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3045.2400000000002s)]
*  complication, a tear in the membrane. She needs to go in. The medical care at that point needs to be [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3051.1600000000003s)]
*  decided by the doctor. And that would have been an abortion. But in Texas, that would have put them [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3056.76s)]
*  in legal jeopardy. She went home, got sepsis, nearly dies, and now she may have difficulty having [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3061.64s)]
*  children. Or in Kentucky, Hadley Duvall, a 12-year-old child raped and impregnated by her [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3067.16s)]
*  stepfather. Those are horrific. Now, when God asked about that, Senator Vance said two wrongs [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3074.04s)]
*  don't make a right. There is no right in this. So in Minnesota, what we did was restore Roe versus [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3079.96s)]
*  Wade. We made sure that we put women in charge of their health care. But look, this is not where, [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3087.24s)]
*  if you don't know Amanda or a Hadley, you soon will. Their project 2025 is going to have a [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3093.4s)]
*  registry of pregnancies. It's going to make it more difficult, if not impossible, to get contraception [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3100.12s)]
*  and limit access, if not eliminate access to infertility treatments. For so many of you out [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3106.84s)]
*  there listening, me included, infertility treatments are why I have a child. That's nobody else's [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3111.96s)]
*  business. But those things are being proposed. And the catch-all on this is, is well, the states will [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3117.1600000000003s)]
*  decide what's right for Texas might not be right for Washington. That's not how this works. This [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3122.92s)]
*  is basic human right. We have seen maternal mortality skyrocket in Texas, outpacing many [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3128.76s)]
*  other countries in the world. This is about health care. In Minnesota, we are ranked first in health [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3136.6s)]
*  care for a reason. We trust women. We trust doctors. Senator, do you want to respond to the [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3141.48s)]
*  governor's plan? Will you create a federal pregnancy monitoring agency? No, Nora, certainly we won't. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3145.64s)]
*  And I want to talk about this issue, because I know a lot of Americans care about it, and I know [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3151.8s)]
*  a lot of Americans don't agree with everything that I've ever said on this topic. And, you know, [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3155.1600000000003s)]
*  I grew up in a working-class family in a neighborhood where I knew a lot of young women who had [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3160.28s)]
*  unplanned pregnancies and decided to terminate those pregnancies because they feel like they [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3164.6800000000003s)]
*  didn't have any other options. And, you know, one of them is actually very dear to me. And I know [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3169.0s)]
*  she's watching tonight, and I love you. And she told me something a couple years ago that she felt [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3174.2000000000003s)]
*  like if she hadn't had that abortion that it would have destroyed her life because she was in [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3180.04s)]
*  an abusive relationship. And I think that what I take from that, as a Republican who proudly wants [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3184.04s)]
*  to protect innocent life in this country, who proudly wants to protect the vulnerable, is that [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3189.4s)]
*  my party, we've got to do so much better of a job at earning the American people's trust back on this [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3194.6s)]
*  issue where they frankly just don't trust us. And I think that's one of the things that Donald Trump [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3201.0s)]
*  and I are endeavoring to do. I want us as a Republican party to be pro-family in the [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3205.24s)]
*  fullest sense of the word. I want us to support fertility treatments. I want us to make it easier [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3210.8399999999997s)]
*  for moms to afford to have babies. I want it to make it easier for young families to afford a home [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3215.4799999999996s)]
*  so they can afford a place to raise that family. And I think there's so much that we can do on the [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3220.4399999999996s)]
*  public policy front just to give women more options. Now, of course, Donald Trump has been [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3225.3199999999997s)]
*  very clear that on the abortion policy specifically, that we have a big country and [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3231.0s)]
*  it's diverse. And California has a different viewpoint on this than Georgia. Georgia has a [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3236.52s)]
*  different viewpoint from Arizona. And the proper way to handle this, as messy as democracy sometimes [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3241.0s)]
*  is, is to let voters make these decisions, let the individual states make their abortion policy. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3247.0s)]
*  And I think that's what makes the most sense. Point for Waltz on this, but only because he's [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3253.56s)]
*  good on the issue and he's right on the issue. And divided country. Governor, would you like [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3258.12s)]
*  to respond and also answer the question about restrictions? Yeah, well, the question got asked [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3262.3599999999997s)]
*  when Donald Trump made the accusation that wasn't true about Minnesota. Well, let me tell you about [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3267.0s)]
*  this idea that there's diverse states. There's a young woman named Amber Thurman. She happened to [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3272.6s)]
*  be in Georgia, a restrictive state. Because of that, she had to travel a long distance to North [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3277.08s)]
*  Carolina to try and get her care. Amber Thurman died in that journey back and forth. The fact of [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3283.16s)]
*  the matter is how can we as a nation say that your life and your rights, as basic as the right to [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3291.72s)]
*  control your own body- Chady Vance hates abortion because his mom would have gotten one if she knew [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3299.3999999999996s)]
*  how he'd be, is a banger. Amber Thurman lived in Minnesota. She would be alive today. That's why [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3303.7999999999997s)]
*  the restoration of Roe versus Wade. When you listen to Vice President Harris talk about this [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3310.04s)]
*  subject and you hear me talk about it, you hear us talking exactly the same. Donald Trump is trying [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3314.2s)]
*  to figure out how to get the political right of this. I agree with a lot of what Senator Vance [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3319.32s)]
*  said about what's happening. His running mate though does not, and that's the problem. Governor, [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3323.32s)]
*  your time is up. Senator, let me ask you about that. He mentioned, I think referring to- Just [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3327.64s)]
*  f***ing say, what about states rights for- These guys are f***ing ridiculous. Okay, just end the [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3331.88s)]
*  conversation. You said if someone can't support legislation like that, quote, you are making the [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3337.4s)]
*  United States the most barbaric pro-abortion regime anywhere in the entire world. My question is, [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3342.6s)]
*  why have you changed your position? Well, Nora, first of all, I never supported a national ban. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3349.2400000000002s)]
*  I did during when I was running for Senate in 2022 talk about setting some minimum national [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3354.44s)]
*  standard. For example, we have a partial birth abortion ban in this in place in this country at [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3358.6s)]
*  the federal level. I don't think anybody's trying to get rid of that, or at least I hope not, though [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3363.1600000000003s)]
*  I know that Democrats have taken a very radical pro-abortion stance. But Nora, you know, one of [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3366.92s)]
*  the things that changed is in the state of Ohio, we had a referendum in 2023 and the people of Ohio [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3371.08s)]
*  voted overwhelmingly, by the way, against my position. And I think that what I learned from [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3377.64s)]
*  that, Nora, is that we've got to do a better job at winning back people's trust. So many young women [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3382.92s)]
*  would love to have families. So many young women also see an unplanned pregnancy as something that's [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3387.8s)]
*  going to destroy their livelihood, destroy their education, destroy their relationships. And we [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3392.6s)]
*  have got to earn people's trust back. And that's why Donald Trump and I are committed to pursuing [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3397.16s)]
*  pro-family policies, making child care more accessible, making fertility treatments more [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3402.44s)]
*  accessible, because we've got to do a better job at that. And that's what real leadership is. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3407.0s)]
*  Governor, your response? I'm going to respond on the pro-abortion piece of that. No, we're not. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3411.64s)]
*  We're pro-women. We're pro-freedom to make your own choice. We know what the implications are to [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3416.7599999999998s)]
*  not be that. Women having miscarriages, women not getting the care, physicians feeling like they may [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3422.28s)]
*  be prosecuted for providing that care. And as far as making sure that we're educating our children [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3428.92s)]
*  and giving them options, Minnesota's a state with one of the lowest teen pregnancy rates. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3434.44s)]
*  We understand that too. We know that the options need to be available and we make that true. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3438.84s)]
*  We also make it, we're a top three state for the best place to raise children. But these two things [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3443.5600000000004s)]
*  to try and say that we're pro-children but we don't like this or you guys are pro-abortion, [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3449.16s)]
*  that's not the case at all. We are pro-freedoms for women to make their choices. And we're going, [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3454.44s)]
*  and Kamala Harris is making the case, to make options for children more affordable, a $6,000 [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3459.56s)]
*  child tax credit. But we're not going to base that on the backs of making someone like Amber Thurman [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3465.16s)]
*  drive 600 miles to try and get health care. Senator? [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3470.2799999999997s)]
*  May I respond to that? First of all, Governor, I agree with you. Amber Thurman should still be [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3473.24s)]
*  alive and there are a lot of people who should still be alive and I certainly wish that she was. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3476.6s)]
*  And maybe you're free to disagree with me on this and explain this to me, but as I read the [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3480.6s)]
*  Minnesota law that you signed into law, the statute that you signed into law, it says that a doctor [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3485.72s)]
*  who presides over an abortion where the baby survives, the doctor is under no obligation [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3492.36s)]
*  to provide life-saving care to a baby who survives a botched late-term abortion. That is, I think, [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3496.92s)]
*  whether you're pro-choice or pro-abortion, that is fundamentally barbaric. And that's why I use [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3503.0s)]
*  that word, Norah, is because some of what we've seen, do you want to force Catholic hospitals [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3508.36s)]
*  to perform abortions against their will? Because Kamala Harris is supported suing Catholic nuns [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3512.76s)]
*  to violate their freedom of conscience. We can be a big and diverse country where we respect [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3517.96s)]
*  people's freedom of conscience and make the country more pro-baby and pro-family. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3522.6800000000003s)]
*  We can't be diverse though. No Haitians allowed. Look, this is one where there's always something [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3526.36s)]
*  there. This is a very simple proposition. These are women's decisions to make about their health [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3530.68s)]
*  care decisions and the physicians who know best when they need to do this. Trying to distort the [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3535.3199999999997s)]
*  way a law is written to try and make a point, that's not it at all. What was I wrong about, [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3540.52s)]
*  Governor? Please tell me, what was I wrong about? That is not the way the law is written. Look, [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3544.2s)]
*  I've given this advice on a lot of things, that getting involved, getting against, that's been [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3547.7999999999997s)]
*  misread and it was fact-checked at the last debate. But the point on this is, is there's a [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3552.52s)]
*  continuation of these guys to try and tell women or to get involved. I use this line on this, [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3556.2s)]
*  just mind your own business on this. Things worked best when Roe versus Wade was in place. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3561.72s)]
*  When we do a restoration of Roe, that works best. That doesn't preclude us from increasing funding [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3566.6s)]
*  for children. It doesn't increase us from making sure that once that child's born, like in Minnesota, [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3573.16s)]
*  they get meals, they get early childhood education, they get health care. So the hiding behind we're [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3577.96s)]
*  going to do all these other things when you're not proposing them in your budget. Kamala Harris [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3584.52s)]
*  is proposing them. She's proposing all those things to make life easier for families. I asked [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3588.6s)]
*  a specific question, Governor. You gave me a slogan as a response. It's not the case. It's not true. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3592.92s)]
*  That's not what the law says. So yeah, he fact-checked it with President Trump. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3597.16s)]
*  Gentlemen, there's a lot to discuss. We have to move on and we're going to be right back with [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3601.72s)]
*  much more of the CBS show debate in just a moment. I'm done. It's so bad. These walls winning or [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3605.08s)]
*  advanced, dude, first of all, they got this absolute hyena over here, this loser to look good. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3611.48s)]
*  Okay. They did for a couple different reasons. One, because the format itself actually makes it [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3621.48s)]
*  so that if you are a sincere person, you're going to look like, okay, you're going to look like a [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3627.48s)]
*  loser. The format itself, the debate setting in general, especially if you're confident enough [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3632.28s)]
*  in your lies, definitely favors the person who's just like a relentless, shameless liar. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3637.56s)]
*  Okay. Straight up. That's just the truth. What do I mean by this? Tim Walz is like Tiananmen square [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3644.52s)]
*  moment or whatever the f**k or what he said about his record going to war. These are genuinely, [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3652.12s)]
*  genuinely tiny minuscule flubs in comparison to being like, I don't give a f**k. I made up the lie [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3659.72s)]
*  that Haitians are eating cats and dogs because the media doesn't cover it. Okay. Like that's not even [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3665.4s)]
*  in the same ecosystem. It is not in the same planet. It's not even in the same goddamn, [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3671.56s)]
*  it's not in the same universe. Okay. So the idea that these two things are then immediately like [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3679.1600000000003s)]
*  placed upon one another as though it's the same level of like lies is ridiculous. But also [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3685.7200000000003s)]
*  on top of that, on top of that, aside from the format, Tim Walz, like I said, is shackled in this [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3693.32s)]
*  structure because he has to defend idiotic propositions. You notice the difference in [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3700.6000000000004s)]
*  communication when he's talking about lowering the cost of pharmaceutical prices, lowering the cost [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3706.92s)]
*  of housing. He pops up when he talks about defending reproductive rights for women, he pops off. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3711.88s)]
*  Okay. Because his heart is in that. When he's talking about allowing Israel to do a first [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3718.52s)]
*  strike on Iran, are you kidding me? That was the first question? Like what a morally bankrupt [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3723.16s)]
*  nation we are. That the first conversation when, you know, we have a goddamn apartheid state doing [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3727.88s)]
*  it, opening up a new front, okay, potentially and escalating regional conflict into all out nuclear [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3736.2s)]
*  war potentially. And that's the first question. Will you give Israel the first strike capabilities [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3744.6s)]
*  to nuke Tehran? Like what are we talking about? Is this morally bankrupt as dude? We, God, we [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3750.04s)]
*  deserve all the bad things. I swear to God. And on that front, he sucked, he sucked, he sucked. He [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3756.8399999999997s)]
*  was awful at that answer. He's like, oh, I think Israel has a right to defend itself October 7. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3762.36s)]
*  Just carbon copy Kamala Harris's talking points like a goddamn NPC. Same thing with the border [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3767.16s)]
*  proposal. Same thing with the border wall. Tim was has been like the border walls dumbest when [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3772.68s)]
*  he was, you know, a governor, right? Under the Trump administration. Now he's over here being [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3777.0s)]
*  like, we're the ones who are going to actually push the border wall. Like, what are you talking [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3781.8799999999997s)]
*  about, dude? Do you hear yourself? What the hell is going on now? Overall, overall, I think the [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3785.64s)]
*  format and the statement itself, like the statements coming from JD Vance are pretty solid because he [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3794.6s)]
*  thrives in this environment. He's been doing a lot of contentious adversarial interviews over [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3800.12s)]
*  and over again. He has a lot of experience. Okay. He has a lot. He has a lot of experience on this [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3804.44s)]
*  front and he's looking better. And not only is he looking better despite his gross and nervous [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3810.04s)]
*  energy, okay. Despite his gross and nervous, sweaty perverted energy that he brings to the goddamn [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3817.24s)]
*  table. The debate format favors him, but also he even looks better than Trump. Okay. That's a very [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3823.8s)]
*  significant part of this. Cause like, if we're having adult conversations, because JD Vance supposed [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3831.5600000000004s)]
*  to be the adult, okay. The, the liberal media train, okay. Against Tim Walz, like Tim Walz looks like [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3836.84s)]
*  a silly little yokel who's constantly on the back foot. And JD Vance looks like a bloodless monster [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3845.0800000000004s)]
*  who's able to communicate his desires better than Trump. Come back to the CBS news vice presidential [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3851.32s)]
*  debate. We want to turn now to America's violence epidemic. The leading cause of death for children [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3856.52s)]
*  and teens in America is by Senator Vance. You oppose most legislation that Democrats claim would [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3862.92s)]
*  curb violence. You oppose red flag laws and legislation to ban certain semi-automatic rifles, [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3869.7200000000003s)]
*  including AR-15s. So let me ask you earlier this year, for the first time, the parents of a school [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3876.36s)]
*  shooter were convicted of involuntary manslaughter. There's a three minute break. I forgot to run it. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3883.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. I was doing commentary. So subscribe for $6 or for free with the Twitch prime to avoid [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3887.8s)]
*  those ads. Here it is. I certainly trust local law enforcement or local authorities to make those [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3894.6000000000004s)]
*  decisions. I think in some cases the answer is going to be yes. And in some cases the answer is [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3899.1600000000003s)]
*  going to be no. And the details really matter here. Of course, for example, if a kid steals, [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3902.6s)]
*  that's going to be different than if a parent hands over and knowing that their kid is potentially [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3907.0s)]
*  dangerous. But look, I want to just sort of speak as a father of three beautiful little kids. And [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3910.8399999999997s)]
*  our oldest is now in second grade. And like a lot of parents, we send our kids to school with such [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3916.2s)]
*  hope and such joy and such pride at their little faces on the first day of school. And we know, [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3921.72s)]
*  unfortunately, that a lot of kids are going to experience this terrible epidemic of violence. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3926.7599999999998s)]
*  And of course, our hearts go out to the families that are affected by this terrible stuff. And we [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3930.76s)]
*  do have to do better. And I think that Governor Walz and I actually probably agree that we need [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3934.92s)]
*  to do better on this. The question is just how do we actually do it? Stop agreeing with one another. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3938.92s)]
*  I hate you. It really bothers me and worries me about this epidemic of violence. Close to 90 percent [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3943.48s)]
*  in some of the statistics I've seen of the violence in this country is committed with [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3948.92s)]
*  illegally obtained. And while we're on that topic, we know that thanks to Kamala Harris's open border, [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3952.84s)]
*  we've seen a massive influx in the number of illegal run by the Mexican drug cartel. So that [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3958.12s)]
*  number, the amount of illegal in our country is higher today than it was three and a half years [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3963.16s)]
*  ago. But what do we do about the schools? What do we do to protect our kids? And I think the answer [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3967.7999999999997s)]
*  is, and I say this not loving the answer, because I don't want my kids to go to school in a school [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3972.44s)]
*  that feels unsafe or where there are visible signs of security. But I unfortunately think that we have [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3978.7599999999998s)]
*  to increase security in our schools. We have to make the doors lock better. We have to make the [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3984.04s)]
*  doors stronger. We've got to make the windows stronger. And of course, we've got to increase [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3988.7599999999998s)]
*  school resource officers because the idea that we can magically wave a wand and take out of the [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3992.84s)]
*  hands of bad guys, it just doesn't fit with recent experience. So we've got to make our schools [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=3997.96s)]
*  safer. And I think we've got to have some common sense bipartisan solutions for how to do that. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4002.52s)]
*  Governor, you have two minutes. Well, I thank all the parents watching tonight. This is just [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4007.24s)]
*  your biggest nightmare. Look, I got a 17-year-old and he witnessed me at a community center playing [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4011.24s)]
*  volleyball. Those things don't leave you. As a member of Congress, I sat in my office surrounded [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4017.7999999999997s)]
*  by dozens of the Sandy Hook parents, and they were looking at my seven-year-old picture on the wall. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4024.3599999999997s)]
*  Their seven-year-old were dead, and they were asking us to do something. And look, I'm a hunter. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4029.08s)]
*  I own what the vice president is. We understand that the Second Amendment is there, but our first [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4034.04s)]
*  responsibilities to our kids to figure this out. In Minnesota, we've enacted enhanced red flag laws, [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4039.16s)]
*  enhanced background checks, and we can start to get data. But here's the problem. If we really [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4046.7599999999998s)]
*  want to solve this, we've got folks that won't allow research to be even done on violence. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4051.3999999999996s)]
*  And this idea that we should just live with it, and here's what I do think, that this is a good [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4057.0s)]
*  start to the conversation. I 100% believe that Senator Vance hates it when these kids, [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4062.44s)]
*  it's abhorrent and it breaks your heart. I agree with that. But that's not far enough when we know [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4068.68s)]
*  there are things that work. I've spent time in Finland and seen some Finnish schools. They don't [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4074.2s)]
*  have this happen, even though they have a high ownership rate in the country. There are reasonable [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4080.2s)]
*  things that we can do to make a difference. It's not infringing on your Second Amendment, [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4085.3999999999996s)]
*  and the idea to have some of these weapons out there, it just doesn't make any sense. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4090.9199999999996s)]
*  Kamala Harris, as an Attorney General, worked on this issue. She knows that it's there. No one's [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4096.04s)]
*  trying to scaremonger and say we're taking your... But I ask all of you out there, do you want your [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4101.32s)]
*  schools hardened to look like a fort? Is that what we have to go? When we know there's countries [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4106.28s)]
*  around the world that their children aren't practicing these types of drills. They're being [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4112.68s)]
*  kids. We owe it to them to get a fix. These are things that shouldn't be that difficult. You can [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4117.56s)]
*  still keep your... And we can make a difference. We have to. If you're listening tonight, [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4122.76s)]
*  this breaks your heart. Senator? Tim, first of all, I didn't know that you're a 17-year-old [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4126.76s)]
*  witness. I'm sorry about that. I appreciate you saying so. Christ have mercy. It is awful. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4131.08s)]
*  I appreciate what Tim said. If you found out that he lied about this, I'm going to lose my mind. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4136.52s)]
*  Frankly, we are differences between our own country's violence problem and Finland is... [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4141.400000000001s)]
*  First of all, we have way higher rates of mental health substance abuse. We have way higher rates [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4146.599999999999s)]
*  of depression, way higher rates of anxiety. We unfortunately have a mental health crisis [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4155.0s)]
*  in this country that I really do think that we need to get to the root causes of because I don't [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4159.72s)]
*  think it's the whole reason why we have such a bad violence problem, but I do think it's a big piece [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4163.4s)]
*  of it. Another driver of the violence epidemic, especially that affecting our kids, it doesn't [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4167.48s)]
*  earn as many headlines, but is the terrible violence problem in a lot of our big cities. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4172.36s)]
*  And this is why we have to empower law enforcement to arrest the bad guys, put them away, [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4177.719999999999s)]
*  and take offenders off the streets. I think there's a whole host of things that we can do here, [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4182.839999999999s)]
*  but I do think at our schools we've got to talk about more security. Senator, thank you. Governor, [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4187.5599999999995s)]
*  you previously opposed an assault weapons ban, but only later in your political career did you [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4191.719999999999s)]
*  change your position. Why? Yeah, I sat in that office with those Sandy Hook parents. I've become [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4196.44s)]
*  friends with school shooters. I've seen it. Look, the NRA, I was in a rage for a long time. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4200.28s)]
*  You should keep safe. No! I'm of an age where mine was in my car so I could pheasant hunt [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4204.44s)]
*  after football practice. That's not where we live today. And several things I want to mention on [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4208.92s)]
*  this about cities and where it's at. The number one where the most deaths happen in Minnesota are [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4214.12s)]
*  rural. And we have an epidemic of children getting themselves. And so we have and we should look at [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4220.28s)]
*  all of the issues. Making sure folks have healthcare and all that, but I want to be very [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4227.4s)]
*  careful. This idea of stigmatizing mental health, just because you have a mental health issue, [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4231.0s)]
*  doesn't mean you're safe. And I think what we end up doing is we start looking for a scapegoat. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4235.639999999999s)]
*  Sometimes it just is the, it's just the, and there are things that you can do about it. But I do [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4239.96s)]
*  think that this is one, and I think this is a healthy conversation. I think there's a capacity. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4244.92s)]
*  I know he meant school shooting victims, dude. I know. Second Amendment, [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4249.24s)]
*  protect our children. That's our priority. Gentlemen, thank you. Margaret? Thank you, Nora. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4252.92s)]
*  Let's turn now to the top contributor to inflation, the high cost of housing and rent. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4257.4s)]
*  There's a shortage of more than 4 million homes in the United States, and that contributes to the [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4263.799999999999s)]
*  high housing prices. Governor Walz, the Harris campaign promises a $25,000 down payment assistance [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4268.92s)]
*  for first-time home buyers and a $10,000 tax credit. They also promise to build 3 million new [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4276.36s)]
*  homes. Where are you building these homes and won't handing out that kind of money just drive [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4284.68s)]
*  up prices higher? No, it's not handing out. We have, first, let me say this, this issue of housing, [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4289.8s)]
*  and I think those of you listening on this, the problem we've had is that we've got a lot of folks [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4295.0s)]
*  that see housing as another commodity. It can be bought up, it can be shifted, it can be moved [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4299.8s)]
*  around. Those are not folks living in those houses. Those of you listening tonight, that house a big [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4305.08s)]
*  deal. I bought and owned one house in my life. My mom still lives in the house where I was, and when [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4309.8s)]
*  I think of a house, I'm thinking of Christmas services after midnight mass where you go with [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4314.44s)]
*  your family. We need to make it more affordable, and one of the things, as I said, this program [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4319.08s)]
*  that the Vice President is pushing forward and bringing a new way of approaching this is something [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4324.28s)]
*  we're doing in Minnesota from that lead. We in the state invested in making sure our housing was the [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4329.799999999999s)]
*  biggest investment that we'd ever made in housing. It starts to make it easier. We cut some of the [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4335.16s)]
*  red tape. Local folks, look, we can't do it at the federal level, but local folks make it easier to [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4339.48s)]
*  build those homes. And then that down payment assistance. I can tell all of you out there, [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4343.8s)]
*  certainly for me, using the GI Bill was one thing, but a veteran's home loan, the big thing about a [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4349.08s)]
*  veteran's home loan is you don't have to pay the down payment. Those are things that make it there. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4355.400000000001s)]
*  Now look, you're going to pay it back, and you're going to pay your mortgage. Those are things that [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4360.28s)]
*  we know in the long run, the appreciated value, the generational wealth that's created from it, [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4363.96s)]
*  and I will give Minneapolis an example. Minneapolis is the one city where we've seen the lowest [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4368.6s)]
*  inflation rates. We've seen a 12% increase in stock because we put some of these things in, [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4373.08s)]
*  and we're implementing a state program to make sure we give some of that down payment assistance. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4378.5199999999995s)]
*  We get it back from people because here's what we know. People with stable housing end up with [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4383.48s)]
*  stable jobs. People with stable housing have their kids able to be able to get to school. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4388.28s)]
*  All of those things in the long run end up saving our money, and that's the thing that I think we [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4393.24s)]
*  should be able to find some common ground in, but we can't blame immigrants for the only reason. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4397.64s)]
*  That's not the case that's happening in many cities. The fact of the matter is that we don't [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4403.72s)]
*  have enough naturally affordable housing, but we can make sure that the government's there to help [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4407.88s)]
*  kickstart it, create that base. Governor, your time is up. Senator Vance, as far as your [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4413.4800000000005s)]
*  campaign's position, the promise is to seize federal lands to build homes, remove regulation, [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4420.84s)]
*  provide tax breaks, and cut back on immigration, which you say pushes up prices. Where are you [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4426.6s)]
*  going to build all the new homes you're promising, and what part of any of this plan will be? [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4432.6s)]
*  I like that our housing policy for the Republican Party is just Hitler, like just straight Adolf Hitler. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4437.08s)]
*  Tim just said something that I agree with. We don't want to blame immigrants for higher housing [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4441.88s)]
*  prices, but we do want to blame Kamala Harris for letting in millions of illegal aliens into this [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4445.64s)]
*  country, which does drive up cost, Tim. 25 million illegal aliens competing with Americans [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4450.52s)]
*  for scarce homes is one of the most significant drivers of home prices in the country. It's why [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4457.56s)]
*  we have massive increases in home prices that have happened right alongside massive increases [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4462.76s)]
*  in illegal alien populations under Kamala Harris's leadership. Now, Tim just mentioned a bunch of [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4469.0s)]
*  ideas. Now, some of those ideas I actually think are halfway decent, and some of them I disagree [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4475.240000000001s)]
*  with. But the most important thing here is Kamala Harris is not running as a newcomer to politics. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4479.32s)]
*  She is the sitting vice president. If she wants to enact all of these policies to make housing [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4485.0s)]
*  more affordable, I invite her to use the office that the American people already gave her, [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4490.36s)]
*  not sit around and campaign and do nothing while Americans find the American dream of [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4495.4s)]
*  homeownership completely unaffordable. Now, you asked, Margaret, what would immediately [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4500.599999999999s)]
*  change the equation for American citizens? If you lower energy prices, as Donald Trump says, [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4505.56s)]
*  drill baby drill, one of the biggest drivers of housing costs aside from illegal immigration [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4511.4800000000005s)]
*  is think about it. If a truck driver is paying 40% more for diesel, then the lumber he's delivering [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4516.4400000000005s)]
*  to the job site to build the house is also going to become a lot more expensive. If we open up [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4521.400000000001s)]
*  American energy, you will get immediate pricing relief for American citizens, not by the way just [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4526.52s)]
*  in housing, but in a whole host of other economic goods, too. Senator Vance, you still have 23 [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4533.24s)]
*  seconds there. Do you want to answer where? Governor, we will get to you in a moment, but, [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4538.84s)]
*  Senator, where are you going to seize the federal lands? Can you clarify? Well, what Donald Trump [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4543.24s)]
*  has said is we have a lot of federal lands that aren't being used for anything. They're not being [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4547.719999999999s)]
*  used for national parks. They're not being used, and they could be places where we build a lot of [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4551.08s)]
*  housing. And I do think that we should be opening up building in this country. We have a lot of land [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4555.48s)]
*  that could be used. We have a lot of Americans that need homes. We should be kicking out illegal [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4561.5599999999995s)]
*  immigrants who are competing for those homes, and we should be building more homes for the American [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4566.12s)]
*  citizens who deserve to be here. Senator, your time is up. Governor, I do want to let you respond [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4570.04s)]
*  to the allegation that the vice president is letting in migrants. Well, of course, that's not true. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4575.5599999999995s)]
*  And again, you have the facts. I guess we agreed not to fact check. I'll check it. Look, crossings [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4580.839999999999s)]
*  are down compared to when Donald Trump left office, but it's again blaming my solution. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4584.839999999999s)]
*  Tell you, it's not the crossings. I was going to ask you on this question. Are we going to drill [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4588.6s)]
*  and build houses in the same federal land? Tackle the issue. It's not the fucking border crossings. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4592.200000000001s)]
*  And I think for people who have federal lands, these are really important pieces of land. Now, [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4595.160000000001s)]
*  Minnesota doesn't have a lot of federal lands. I know in the western part of the countries we do. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4598.280000000001s)]
*  There's not a lot of federal lands in and around Minneapolis, for example. So the issue is, is I [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4602.200000000001s)]
*  don't understand the federal lands issue unless we see this, and I worry about this as someone who [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4607.8s)]
*  cares deeply about our national parks and our federal lands. Look, Minnesota, we protect these [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4611.96s)]
*  things. We've got about 20 percent of the world's fresh water. These lands protect. They're there for [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4616.44s)]
*  a reason. They belong to all of us. But again, this is when you view housing and you view these [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4620.839999999999s)]
*  things as commodities. Like there's a chance to make money here. Let's take this federal land [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4625.799999999999s)]
*  and let's sell it to people for that. I think there's better ways to do this. We've seen it [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4629.5599999999995s)]
*  in Minnesota. We're able to refurbish some of these houses. We're able to make some investments. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4633.5599999999995s)]
*  That gets people in. And I'm still on the fact on this, economists. Senator Vance, you said you [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4637.32s)]
*  don't like the economists. Which economists are saying that it is immigrants that's adding to the [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4643.4s)]
*  cost? Governor, your time is up, but Senator, on that point, I'd like for you to clarify. There are [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4647.4s)]
*  many contributing factors to high housing costs. What evidence do you have that migrants are part [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4654.28s)]
*  of this problem? Well, there's a federal reserve study that we're happy to share after the debate. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4661.24s)]
*  We'll put it up on social media, actually, that really drills down on the connection between [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4665.48s)]
*  increased levels of migration, especially illegal immigration and higher housing prices. Now, of [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4669.96s)]
*  course, Margaret, that's not the entire driver of higher housing prices. It's also the regulatory [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4674.6s)]
*  regime of Kamala Harris. Look, we are a country of builders. We're a country of doers. We're a [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4680.2s)]
*  country of explorers. But we increasingly have a federal administration that makes it harder to [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4685.4s)]
*  develop our resources, makes it harder to build things, and wants to throw people in jail for [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4691.16s)]
*  not doing everything exactly as Kamala Harris says they have to do. And what that means is that you [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4697.24s)]
*  have a lot of people who would love to build homes who aren't able to build homes. I actually agree [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4703.16s)]
*  with Tim Walz. We should get out of this idea of housing as a commodity, but the thing that has most [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4707.48s)]
*  turned housing into a commodity is giving it away to millions upon millions of people who have no [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4712.76s)]
*  legal right to be here. What are the federal regulations? I deal with this as a governor. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4718.76s)]
*  You can very quickly reply. I'm sorry. I get this as a governor, and I don't necessarily disagree [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4723.88s)]
*  with that. That in some cases, many of those are local. Many of them are state. I don't know which [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4729.0s)]
*  ones are federal, but I think whenever we talk regulations, people think they can get rid of them. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4733.32s)]
*  I think you want to be able to get out of your house in a fire. I think you want to make sure [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4738.36s)]
*  that it's fireproof and those types of things. So which are the regulations? Because the vice [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4742.36s)]
*  president's not responsible for those. Congress writes those. Governor, thank you. Gentlemen, [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4746.5199999999995s)]
*  we have a lot to get through. You're passionate about the housing crisis. I can tell. But Nora? [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4752.04s)]
*  Thank you. One of the top problems facing Americans is the high cost of health care. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4757.16s)]
*  Senator Vance, at the last presidential debate, former President Trump was asked about replacing [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4762.44s)]
*  the Affordable Care Act. In response, he said, I have concepts of a plan. Since then, Senator, [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4767.8s)]
*  you've talked about changing how chronically ill Americans get health insurance. Can you explain [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4774.84s)]
*  how that would work? And can you guarantee that Americans with pre-existing conditions [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4780.28s)]
*  won't pay more? I'll give you two minutes. Well, of course, we're going to cover Americans with [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4785.5599999999995s)]
*  pre-existing conditions. In fact, a lot of my family members have gotten health care. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4790.599999999999s)]
*  I believe, you know, members of my family actually got private health insurance, at least for the [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4795.5599999999995s)]
*  first time, switched off of Medicaid onto private insurance for the first time under Donald Trump's [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4799.5599999999995s)]
*  leadership. And I think that, you know, a lot of people have criticized this concepts of a plan [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4804.36s)]
*  remark. It's very simple common sense. I think, as Tim Walz knows from 12 years in Congress, [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4808.6s)]
*  you're not going to propose a 900-page bill standing on a debate stage. It would bore everybody to [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4813.160000000001s)]
*  tears. And it wouldn't actually mean anything because part of this is the give and take of [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4817.96s)]
*  bipartisan negotiation. Now, when Donald Trump was actually president—and again, he has a record to [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4822.04s)]
*  be proud of—prescription drugs fell in 2018 for the first time in a very long time under Kamala [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4827.0s)]
*  Harris's leadership. Prescription drugs are up about 7 percent. Under Donald Trump's entire four [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4833.08s)]
*  years, they were up about 1.5 percent. He introduced pricing transparency. Think about health care. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4837.88s)]
*  You go into a hospital, you try to buy something, and nobody knows what it actually costs. That [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4844.04s)]
*  price transparency will actually give American consumers a little bit more choice and will also [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4849.08s)]
*  drive down costs. And we talked about, you know, the reinsurance regulations is what I was talking [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4854.12s)]
*  about. Look, Donald Trump has said that if we allow states to experiment a little bit on how [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4859.400000000001s)]
*  to cover both the chronically ill but the non-chronically ill, it's not just a plan. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4864.44s)]
*  He actually implemented some of these regulations when he was president of the United States. And [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4869.32s)]
*  I think you can make a really good argument that it salvaged Obamacare— [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4874.28s)]
*  Price transparency is such a laughable joke of a health care solution. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4877.24s)]
*  —until Donald Trump came along. I think this is an important point about President Trump. Of course, [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4882.44s)]
*  you don't have to agree with everything that President Trump has ever said or ever done. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4883.639999999999s)]
*  But when Obamacare was crushing under the weight of its own regulatory burden and health care costs, [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4888.28s)]
*  Donald Trump could have destroyed the program. Instead, he worked in a bipartisan way to ensure [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4894.04s)]
*  that Americans had access to affordable care. It's not perfect, of course, and there's so much more [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4899.8s)]
*  that we can do. But I think that Donald Trump has earned the right to put in place some better [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4904.76s)]
*  health care policies. He's earned it because he did it successfully the first time. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4909.48s)]
*  Governor? [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4913.88s)]
*  All right. Here's where being an old guy gives you some history. I was there at the creation of the [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4914.84s)]
*  ACA. And the reason it was so important is I come from a major health care state, home of the Mayo [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4920.28s)]
*  Clinic, home to Medical Alley, 3M, Medtronic, all of those. We understand health care. It's why we're [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4927.24s)]
*  ranked first on affordability and health care. And so what I know is, under Kamala Harris, [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4933.639999999999s)]
*  more people are covered than they have before. And those of you listening, this is critical to you. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4939.72s)]
*  Now, Donald Trump all of a sudden wants to go back and remember this. He ran on the first thing [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4943.96s)]
*  he was going to do on day one was to repeal Obamacare. On day one, he tried to sign an [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4950.04s)]
*  executive order to repeal the ACA. He signed on to a lawsuit to repeal the ACA but lost at the [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4955.8s)]
*  Supreme Court. And he would have repealed the ACA had it not been for the courage of John McCain [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4963.48s)]
*  to save that bill. Now, fast forward, what that means to you is you lose your preexisting conditions. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4969.88s)]
*  If you're sitting at home and you got asthma, too bad. If you're a woman, probably not. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4975.72s)]
*  Broke your foot during football, might kick you out. Your kids get kicked out when they're 26. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4979.56s)]
*  Kamala Harris negotiated drug prices for the first time with Medicare. We have 10 drugs that will [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4984.6s)]
*  come online, the most common ones that'll be there. But look, this issue, and when Donald Trump said, [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4990.120000000001s)]
*  I've got a concept of a plan, it cracked me up as a fourth grade teacher because my kids would have [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=4996.4400000000005s)]
*  never given me that. But what Senator Vance just explained might be worse than a concept because [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5001.080000000001s)]
*  what he explained is pre-Obama care. And I'll make this as simple as possible because I have [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5006.76s)]
*  done this for a long time. What they're saying is if you're healthy, why should you be paying more? [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5011.16s)]
*  So what they're going to do is let insurance companies pick who they insure because guess [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5017.72s)]
*  what happens? You pay your premium, it's not much. They figure they're not going to have to pay out [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5021.400000000001s)]
*  to you. But those of you a little older, gray, you know, got cancer, you're going to get kicked [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5025.4800000000005s)]
*  out of it. That's why the system didn't work. Kamala Harris will protect and enhance the ACA. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5030.76s)]
*  Governor, thank you. Senator, you have not yet explained how you would protect people with [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5036.2s)]
*  pre-existing conditions or laid out that plan. Well, look, we currently have laws and regulations [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5040.28s)]
*  in place right now that protect people with pre-existing conditions. We want to keep those [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5045.88s)]
*  regulations in place, but we also want to make the health insurance marketplace function a little [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5049.8s)]
*  bit better. Now, what Governor Walz just said is actually not true. A lot of what happened, [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5054.12s)]
*  and the reason that Obamacare was crushing under its own weight is that a lot of young and healthy [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5059.16s)]
*  people were leaving the exchanges. Donald Trump actually helped address that problem, [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5063.56s)]
*  and he did so in a way that preserved people's access to coverage who had pre-existing conditions. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5068.4400000000005s)]
*  But again, something that these guys do is they make a lot of claims about if Donald Trump becomes [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5073.96s)]
*  president, all of these terrible consequences are going to ensue. But in reality, Donald Trump was [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5080.68s)]
*  president, inflation was low, take-home pay was higher, and he saved the very program from a [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5085.8s)]
*  Democratic administration that was collapsing and would have collapsed absent his leadership. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5091.4s)]
*  He did his job, which is govern, in a bipartisan way and get results, not just complain about [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5097.16s)]
*  problems, but actually solve them. Governor, did enrollment under the Affordable Care Act go up [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5102.839999999999s)]
*  under the Trump administration? It's higher now that we've seen it go up. Look, people are using [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5107.879999999999s)]
*  it. The system works. And the question about this of young people or whatever, that's the individual [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5112.599999999999s)]
*  mandate piece of this. And Republicans fought tooth and nail saying, well, Americans should be [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5117.08s)]
*  free to do this. Well, then what happens is- So you think the individual mandate's a good idea? [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5121.96s)]
*  You shrink. I think the idea of making sure the risk pool is broad enough to cover everyone, [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5124.5199999999995s)]
*  that's the only way insurance works. When it doesn't, it collapses. You are asking pre-ACA [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5129.08s)]
*  where we get people out. Look, people know that they need to be on healthcare. People expect it [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5134.28s)]
*  to be there. And when we are able to make it, and we are making it this way, when we incentivize [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5140.84s)]
*  people to be in the market, when we help people who might not be able to afford it get there, [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5146.68s)]
*  and we make sure then when you get sick and old, it's there for you. Because I heard people say, [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5151.56s)]
*  well, I don't want to buy into Medicare or whatever. Good luck buying healthcare once you get past 70. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5156.360000000001s)]
*  So look, the ACA works. We can continue to do better. Kamala Harris did that. The way she made [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5161.320000000001s)]
*  everything better was negotiating those 10 drugs on Medicare for the first time in American history. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5166.200000000001s)]
*  Thank you. Margaret? Can I address that? I apologize. We're out of time. We have a [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5171.72s)]
*  number of subjects to discuss. Margaret? Let's talk about families in America. There is a child [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5175.16s)]
*  care crisis in this country, and the United States is one of the very few developed countries [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5180.36s)]
*  in the world without a national paid leave program for new parents. Governor Walz, you said that if [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5186.599999999999s)]
*  Democrats win both the White House and Congress, this is a day one priority for you. How long should [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5193.4s)]
*  employers be required to pay workers while they are home taking care of their newborns? You have [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5199.96s)]
*  two minutes. Yeah, well, that's negotiable, and that's what Congress worked. But here's what the [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5204.92s)]
*  deal is. Americans sitting out there right now, you may work for a big company. Look, we're home [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5209.88s)]
*  in Minnesota to some of the largest Fortune 500 companies. Kamala Harris knows that in California. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5215.24s)]
*  Those companies provide paid family medical leave. One is, I think they're moral and they think it's [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5220.84s)]
*  a good thing, but it also keeps their employees healthy. We in Minnesota passed a paid family [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5225.88s)]
*  medical leave. You have a child, you, and I had to go back to work five days after my kids were born. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5230.84s)]
*  This allows you to stay home a certain amount of time. What we know is that gets the child off to [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5236.52s)]
*  a better start, the family works better, we stay in their employers, we get more consistency in that. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5241.32s)]
*  So Kamala Harris has made it a priority. We implemented it in Minnesota and we see growth. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5245.88s)]
*  That's how you become a pro-business state. But the negotiations on it, and here's the issue, [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5250.360000000001s)]
*  those big companies are able to offer it. Those of you out there who don't have it, [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5256.2s)]
*  just imagine what happens if you get cancer or your child gets sick. We know what happens. You end [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5260.92s)]
*  up staying home. In some cases, that means no paycheck because you've got no protection on that. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5267.0s)]
*  This is the case of an economy that Donald Trump has set for the wealthiest amongst us. He's willing [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5272.2s)]
*  to give those tax breaks to the wealthiest. He's willing to say, bust those unions up, do whatever. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5278.04s)]
*  What we're saying is the economy works best when it works for all of us. And so a paid family medical [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5284.44s)]
*  leave program, and I will tell you, go to the families or go to the businesses and ask them. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5289.96s)]
*  As far as child care on this, you have to take it at both the supply and the demand side. You can't [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5294.839999999999s)]
*  expect the most important people in our lives to take either our children or our parents to get paid [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5300.36s)]
*  the least amount of money. And we have to make it easier for folks to be able to get into that [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5305.96s)]
*  business and then to make sure that folks are able to pay for that. We were able to do it in [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5310.68s)]
*  Minnesota and I'm still telling you this, we were listed as the best state. We're still in crisis on [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5314.52s)]
*  this. A federal program of paid family medical leave and help with this will enhance our workforce, [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5319.08s)]
*  enhance our families and make it easier to have the children that you want. Governor, your time is up. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5324.4400000000005s)]
*  Senator, do you support a national paid leave program? And if so, for how long should employers [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5329.320000000001s)]
*  be mandated? No, get them back to work, bitch. Get back to work! [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5336.12s)]
*  Yeah, well first of all, Margaret, a number of my Republican colleagues and some Democrats too [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5341.32s)]
*  have worked on this issue and I think there is a bipartisan solution here because a lot of us [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5344.599999999999s)]
*  care about this issue. I mean, look, I speak from this very personally because I'm married to a [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5348.28s)]
*  beautiful woman who is an incredible mother to our three beautiful kids. I'm married to a female! [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5354.04s)]
*  But is also a very, very brilliant corporate litigator and I'm so proud of her. But being a [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5357.4s)]
*  working mom, even for somebody with all of the advantages of my wife, is extraordinarily difficult. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5362.52s)]
*  And it's not just difficult from a policy perspective. She actually had access to paid [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5368.68s)]
*  family leave because she worked for a bigger company. But the cultural pressure on young [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5372.4400000000005s)]
*  families and especially young women, I think makes it really hard for people to choose the family [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5377.72s)]
*  model they want. A lot of young women would like to go back to work immediately. Some would like to [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5382.68s)]
*  spend a little time home with the kids. Some would like to spend longer at home with the kids. We [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5386.52s)]
*  should have a family care model that makes choice possible. And I think this is a very important [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5390.2s)]
*  substantive difference between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris's approach. I mean, look, if you look [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5395.72s)]
*  at the federal programs that we have that support paid family leave right now, the Community [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5400.28s)]
*  Development Block Grant, and there's another block grant program that spends a lot of money [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5405.08s)]
*  from the federal government. These programs only go to one kind of child care model. Let's say you'd [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5408.679999999999s)]
*  like your church maybe to help you out with child care. Maybe you live in a rural area or an urban [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5413.8s)]
*  area and you'd like to get together with families in your neighborhood to provide child care in the [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5418.68s)]
*  way that makes the most sense. You don't get access to any of these federal monies. We want to promote [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5423.16s)]
*  choice in how we deliver family care and how we promote child care because, look, it is unacceptable. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5428.200000000001s)]
*  And, you know, of course, Tim and I have been on the campaign trail a lot the past seven or eight [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5434.84s)]
*  weeks. And one of the biggest complaints I hear from young families is people who feel like they [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5438.360000000001s)]
*  don't have options, like they're choosing between going to work or taking care for their kids. That [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5443.16s)]
*  is an incredible burden to put on American families. We're the only country that does it. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5448.28s)]
*  I think we could do a heck of a lot better. Senator, thank you. You have also said, Senator Vance, [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5452.92s)]
*  many things about the American family. The Federal Reserve says parents will spend nearly as much on [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5460.04s)]
*  child care as they do on housing each month. By the way, moderators have been carrying this for a while. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5466.759999999999s)]
*  President Trump recently said, as much as child care is talked about as being expensive, it's [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5472.84s)]
*  relatively speaking not very expensive compared to the kinds of numbers we'll be taking in. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5479.400000000001s)]
*  Is President Trump committed to the $5,000 per child tax credit that you have described? [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5486.04s)]
*  You have one minute. Well, what President Trump said, Margaret, I just want to defend my running [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5492.360000000001s)]
*  mate here a little bit, is that we're going to be taking in a lot of money by penalizing companies [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5495.96s)]
*  for shipping jobs overseas and penalizing countries who employ slave laborers and then [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5500.92s)]
*  ship their products back into our country and undercut the wages of American workers. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5506.68s)]
*  It's the heart of the Donald Trump economic plan. Cut taxes for American workers and American [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5510.52s)]
*  families. Cut taxes for businesses that are hiring and building companies in the United States of [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5515.56s)]
*  America, but penalize companies and countries that are shipping jobs overseas. That's the heart of [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5520.04s)]
*  the economic proposal. And I think what President Trump is saying is that when we bring in this [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5525.64s)]
*  additional revenue with higher economic growth, we're going to be able to provide paid family [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5529.32s)]
*  leave, child care options that are viable and workable for a lot of American families. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5534.2s)]
*  Can you clarify how that will solve the child care shortage? [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5539.0s)]
*  Well, because as Tim said, a lot of the child care shortages, we just don't have enough resources [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5543.799999999999s)]
*  going into the multiple people who could be providing family care options. And we're going [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5548.36s)]
*  to have to, unfortunately, look, we're going to have to spend more money. We're going to have [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5553.4s)]
*  to induce more people to want to provide child care options for American families. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5556.84s)]
*  Because the reason it's so expensive right now is because you've got way too few people providing [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5560.92s)]
*  this very essential service. Thank you, Senator. Governor Walz, your ticket also has some child [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5565.72s)]
*  care tax credit proposals. Do you think Congress will agree to the $6,000 credit for newborns and [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5572.12s)]
*  $3,000 credit for children over the age of six as your campaign has promised? Is that realistic? [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5578.68s)]
*  Well, if these members of Congress are listening to anybody, I can tell you, and [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5585.56s)]
*  this is the biggest issue. Everybody listening tonight knows. I mean, I'm sure they were shocked [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5589.400000000001s)]
*  to hear it's not that expensive. And let's be clear, whether it's $5,000 or $6,000, that [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5593.320000000001s)]
*  pays you about three or four months. Let's be clear of where we're at on this. It's because we [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5598.360000000001s)]
*  got out of an imbalance on this. We thought we were going to get by by not paying people. I don't [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5602.52s)]
*  think Senator Vence and I are that far apart. I'm not opposed to what he's talking about on options. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5606.4400000000005s)]
*  We've done scholarships types of things. I think we need to be open to making the case. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5610.92s)]
*  But the issue here is the question you asked is you're not going to pay for it with these tariffs. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5614.52s)]
*  That's just adding another $4,000 on the family and taking less. So not only do they not get the [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5619.56s)]
*  money to pay for that, there are $4,000 in the hole. That's Wharton School. That's his alma mater. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5624.200000000001s)]
*  And so I think the issue here is if those members of Congress, I can't believe they're not in. When [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5629.4800000000005s)]
*  I go to businesses, sure, they'll talk about taxes sometime, but they will lead with child care and [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5634.360000000001s)]
*  they will lead with housing because we know the problem is, especially in a state like Minnesota, [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5639.320000000001s)]
*  we need more workers because our economy is growing, but we need the workforce. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5643.48s)]
*  Governor, thank you. We need to move on. Nora, let's talk about the state of democracy for [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5647.08s)]
*  Americans after the economy and inflation. After the 2020 election, President Trump's campaign and [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5651.719999999999s)]
*  others filed 62 lawsuits contesting the results. Judges, including those appointed by President [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5658.28s)]
*  Trump and other Republican presidents, looked at the evidence and said there was no widespread [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5665.639999999999s)]
*  fraud. The governors of every state in the nation, Republicans and Democrats, [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5671.56s)]
*  certified the 2020 election results and sent a legal slate of electors to Congress for January 6th. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5678.04s)]
*  Senator Vance, you have said you would not have certified the last presidential election and [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5686.280000000001s)]
*  would have asked the states to submit alternative electors. That has been called unconstitutional [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5691.320000000001s)]
*  and illegal. Would you again seek to challenge this year's election results even if every [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5697.16s)]
*  governor certifies the results? I'll give you two minutes. Well, Nora, first of all, I think that [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5703.72s)]
*  we're focused on the future. We need to figure out how to solve the inflation crisis caused by [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5708.92s)]
*  Kamala Harris's policies, make housing affordable, make groceries affordable, and that's what we're [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5712.84s)]
*  focused on. But I want to answer your question because you did ask it. Look, what President [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5717.639999999999s)]
*  Trump has said is that there were problems in 2020 and my own belief is that we should fight [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5721.16s)]
*  about those issues, debate those issues peacefully in the public square and that's all I've said and [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5726.12s)]
*  that's all that Donald Trump has said. Remember, he said that on January the 6th the protesters [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5732.5199999999995s)]
*  ought to protest peacefully and on January the 20th what happened? Joe Biden became the president, [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5737.32s)]
*  Donald Trump left the White House, and now of course, unfortunately, we have all of the negative [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5742.599999999999s)]
*  policies that have come from the Harris-Biden administration. I believe that we actually do [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5747.24s)]
*  have a threat to democracy in this country, but unfortunately, it's not the threat to democracy [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5752.2s)]
*  that Kamala Harris and Joe Biden are talking about. He's like, they should have let it happen [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5756.5199999999995s)]
*  so that Joe Biden could have ruined the country. Great answer, sir. Thank you. It's Americans casting [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5760.12s)]
*  aside lifelong friendships because of disagreements over politics, it's big technology companies [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5763.32s)]
*  silencing their fellow citizens, and it's Kamala Harris saying that rather than debate and persuade [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5769.24s)]
*  her fellow Americans, she'd like to censor people who engage in misinformation. I think that is a [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5774.2s)]
*  much bigger threat to democracy than anything that we've seen in this country in the last four [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5779.56s)]
*  years, in the last 40 years. Now, I'm really proud, especially given that I was raised by two lifelong [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5783.72s)]
*  blue collar Democrats to have the endorsement of Bobby Kennedy Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard, lifelong [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5789.320000000001s)]
*  leaders in the Democratic coalition. And of course, they don't agree with me at all. Tulsi Gabbard, a lifelong leader in the Democratic coalition. We don't have to agree on every issue, [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5795.400000000001s)]
*  but we're united behind a basic American first amendment principle that we ought to debate our [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5802.120000000001s)]
*  differences. We are our fellow Americans. Kamala Harris is engaged in censorship at an industrial scale. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5807.24s)]
*  She did it during COVID. She's done it over a number of other issues, and that to me is a much bigger threat to democracy [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5815.0s)]
*  than what Donald Trump said when he said that protesters should peacefully protest on January the 6th. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5821.32s)]
*  Governor? Well, I've enjoyed tonight's debate, and I think there was a lot of commonality here, and I'm [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5826.599999999999s)]
*  sympathetic to misspeaking on things, and I think I might with the senator. Me too, man. There's one. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5830.679999999999s)]
*  There's one, though, that this one is troubling to me, and I say that because I think we need to tell the story. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5836.12s)]
*  Donald Trump refused to acknowledge this, and the fact is that I don't think we can be the frog in the pot and let the boiling water go up. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5841.32s)]
*  He was very clear. I mean, he lost this election, and he said he didn't. 140 police officers were [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5847.48s)]
*  beaten at the Capitol that day, some with the American flag, several later died, and it wasn't just in there. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5852.92s)]
*  In Minnesota, a group gathered on the state Capitol grounds in St. Paul and said, we're marching to the [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5859.0s)]
*  governor's residence, and there may be casualties. The only person there was my son and his dog who was [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5864.76s)]
*  rushed out crying by state police. That issue and Mike Pence standing there as they were chanting, [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5869.320000000001s)]
*  hang Mike Pence. Mike Pence made the right decision. So, Senator, it was adjudicated over and over and over. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5875.320000000001s)]
*  I worked with kids long enough to know, and I said as a football coach, sometimes you really want to win, [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5881.88s)]
*  but the democracy is bigger than winning an election. You shake hands, and then you try and do everything [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5886.360000000001s)]
*  you can to help the other side win. That's what was at stake here. Now, the thing I'm most concerned [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5891.64s)]
*  about is the idea that imprisoning your political opponents, already laying the groundwork [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5896.92s)]
*  for people not accepting this, and a president's words matter. A president's words matter. People [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5904.76s)]
*  hear that. So, I think this issue of settling our differences at the ballot box, shaking hands when [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5911.160000000001s)]
*  we lose, being honest about it, but to deny what happened on January 6th, the first time in American [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5918.2s)]
*  history that a president or anyone tried to overturn a fair election and the peaceful transfer of power. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5925.72s)]
*  And here we are four years later in the same boat. I will tell you this, that when this is over, we [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5932.44s)]
*  need to shake hands this election, and the winner needs to be the winner. This has got to stop. It's [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5938.599999999999s)]
*  tearing our country apart. Margaret, Senator Vance, did you want to respond to that? Yeah, well look, [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5943.88s)]
*  Tim, first of all, it's really rich for democratic leaders to say that Donald Trump is a unique [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5948.68s)]
*  threat to democracy when he peacefully gave over power on January the 20th, as we have done for 250 [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5955.8s)]
*  years in this country. We are going to shake hands after this debate and after this election, and of [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5962.52s)]
*  course, I hope that we win, and I think we're going to win, but if Tim Walsh is the next vice president, [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5966.76s)]
*  he'll have my prayers, he'll have my best wishes, and he'll have my help whenever he wants it. But we [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5971.16s)]
*  have to remember that for years in this country, Democrats protested the results of elections. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5976.36s)]
*  Hillary Clinton in 2016 said that Donald Trump had the election stolen by Vladimir Putin because the [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5981.639999999999s)]
*  Russians bought like $500,000 worth of Facebook ads. This has been going on for a long time, [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5988.36s)]
*  and if we want to say that we need to respect the results of the election, I'm on board. But if we [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5994.28s)]
*  want to say, as Tim Walsh is saying, that this is just a problem that Republicans have had, [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=5998.92s)]
*  I don't buy that. Governor. January 6th was not Facebook ads, and I think revisionist history on [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6002.92s)]
*  this. Look, I don't understand how we got to this point, but the issue was that happened. Oh, January 6th is so boring. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6008.6s)]
*  Donald Trump can you do it? And all of us- I don't like this. I want more January 6th's. It was funny. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6015.08s)]
*  This idea of the censorship to stop- Give it up. From doing- [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6020.2s)]
*  Give it up. From trying to kill someone. We need more January 6th's. It was very funny, objectively. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6022.76s)]
*  Censorship is book banning. We've seen that. We've seen that brought up. I just think for everyone tonight, [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6027.400000000001s)]
*  and I'm going to thank Senator Vance. I think this is the conversation they want to hear, and I think [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6033.0s)]
*  there's a lot of agreement. This is one that we are miles apart on. This was a threat to our democracy [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6039.4800000000005s)]
*  in a way that we had not seen, and it manifested itself because of Donald Trump's inability to say- [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6045.0s)]
*  Is your second 821? No. He didn't lose the election. I would just say that. No, it's not. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6050.2s)]
*  He didn't lose the 2020 election. A bunch of fat Republicans trying to climb over the Capitol wall? [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6054.12s)]
*  Speaking their mind in the wake of the 2020 COVID situation. To do what? Take photos and poop? [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6059.8s)]
*  Is that an AC Pelosi's office? That is a damning non-answer. It's a damning non-answer. Yeah, [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6063.4s)]
*  it was objectively funny. Sorry. I'm talking about censorship. Obviously, Donald Trump and I [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6067.5599999999995s)]
*  think that there were problems in 2020. We've talked about it. I'm happy to talk about it further. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6070.92s)]
*  A lot of you are liars. You guys attacked us for not believing in democracy. You are lying to [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6074.5199999999995s)]
*  yourselves. That was hilarious. That sacred right under the United States democracy is the First [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6077.64s)]
*  Amendment. You yourself have said there's no First Amendment right to misinformation. Kamala [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6082.76s)]
*  Harris wants to- Let's speak. ... of government and big tech to silence people from speaking [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6087.88s)]
*  their minds. That is a threat to democracy that will long outlive this present political moment. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6092.04s)]
*  I would like Democrats and Republicans to both reject censorship. Let's persuade one another. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6096.68s)]
*  Let's argue about ideas, and then let's come together afterwards. You can't yell fire in a [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6102.12s)]
*  crowded theater. That's the test. That's the Supreme Court test. Tim, fire in a crowded theater. You [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6106.52s)]
*  guys wanted to kick people off of Facebook for saying that toddlers shouldn't wear masks. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6111.72s)]
*  Senator, the governor does have the floor. That's not the problem. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6115.64s)]
*  Fire in a crowded theater. That is criticizing the policies of the government. Why are you [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6117.4800000000005s)]
*  apologizing? Which is the right of every American. You have the floor. Senator, the governor does have [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6121.320000000001s)]
*  the floor for one minute to respond to you. You have the floor, Tim, you pussy. I don't run [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6125.0s)]
*  Facebook. What I do know is- You were a goddamn veteran for 24 years. ... who [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6128.2s)]
*  infused and now again- Have some fucking backbone. ... I'm pretty shocked by this. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6131.88s)]
*  He lost the election. This is not a debate. It's not anything anywhere other than in [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6135.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's world. Minnesota's are literally spiritually Canadian. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6141.64s)]
*  ... made that decision to certify that election. That's why Mike Pence isn't on this stage. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6145.72s)]
*  What I'm concerned about is where is the firewall with Donald Trump? Where is the firewall if he [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6151.4800000000005s)]
*  knows he could do anything, including taking an election and his vice president's not going to [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6158.52s)]
*  stand to it? That's what we're asking you, America. Will you stand up? Will you keep your oath of [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6165.240000000001s)]
*  office even if the president doesn't? I think Kamala Harris would agree. She wouldn't have [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6170.92s)]
*  picked me if she didn't think I would do that because of course that's what we would do. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6176.2s)]
*  America, I think you've got a really clear choice on this election of who's going to honor that [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6180.4400000000005s)]
*  democracy and who's going to honor Donald Trump. Governor, your time is up. Thank you, gentlemen. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6185.08s)]
*  We will be right back with both of our candidates. The CBS News vice presidential debate continues. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6191.16s)]
*  In the midst of yelling, he literally just the drum pants is not there. I mean, I look, dude, [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6196.84s)]
*  look, look, look, this, this debate is mid. Okay. I know when, you know, when the dust settles, [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6200.76s)]
*  everyone will make up their minds, but it's just such an ass debate. Luckily for the Democrats who [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6208.12s)]
*  really care about Kamala Harris winning, let's be real. It's not all that consequential. Tim [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6214.2s)]
*  Waltz has his high notes whenever he's talking about issues that he actually cares about, [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6222.28s)]
*  but God damn, dude, this is the same exact thing that I felt when I watched Bernie Sanders on that [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6226.36s)]
*  goddamn stage. I was like, dude, attack, dude, attack. You're debating against a literal hit [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6231.08s)]
*  Larry and candidate who's just sitting there like an insurance salesman on television telling you [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6239.719999999999s)]
*  that the Viagra is supposed to make your explode and it's normal and you can't sue the [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6246.76s)]
*  pharmaceutical company. Just address any of his indignity, address anything that he is doing. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6251.88s)]
*  Kamala Harris straight up whipped up Donald Trump, sauced him, put him in a pan and fried his ass. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6260.84s)]
*  Okay. Tim was like, Oh my God. Oh, well, I agree with this guy. Don't you know? Oh, [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6269.96s)]
*  oh, I agree with him. I agree. Cook his ass. He sucks. He sucks. He's weird. You [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6276.2s)]
*  coined the weird term. Say he's weird because he's weird. God damn, dude. I want to move to [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6283.88s)]
*  Minnesota. He's talked more about how sick Minnesota is. I'm over here looking at house [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6290.36s)]
*  prices in Minnesota. I'm like, Oh, do I move there? Seems pretty good to me. Seems like a [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6295.72s)]
*  great place to live. Great governor. Oh my God, dude. Oh my God. On the aesthetic front, it is like [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6300.4400000000005s)]
*  mind boggling. It is mind boggling. It's crazy. Okay. I guess the hope is that like Americans [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6308.280000000001s)]
*  will see that Tim Walz is like a normal guy, even though I think he destroyed that normal guy [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6316.84s)]
*  sentiment with the most important part of the debate, which is the first answer to Israel. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6323.4s)]
*  Like he came across Israel on border. Both of those issues when everyone was locked in, [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6329.799999999999s)]
*  he came across like a, you know, empty suit. And now he comes across like a real human being. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6335.719999999999s)]
*  But the unfortunate problem is, when he comes across like a human being, he's still too docile. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6341.08s)]
*  Oh, God damn. I do. I do think that this man has been defanged in general. It's just so bad. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6347.48s)]
*  It literally feels like they're just like, yeah, we hate our presidential candidates. Like, why [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6354.5199999999995s)]
*  don't we just run together? Okay. Look at what Trump just retweeted. What did he retweet? My [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6359.4s)]
*  daughter was in the Parkland shooting. It's abhorrent that Tim Walz has been here befriended [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6365.24s)]
*  school shooters disqualifying. Come on, dog. Are you insane? What the wait, is this the one guy who [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6370.679999999999s)]
*  whose parent whose daughter died in Parkland, but then was like literally the one guy whose daughter [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6377.400000000001s)]
*  died in Parkland, but thought that it was like fake. That's the guy, right? Is the one crazy one. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6384.04s)]
*  Okay. Yeah. That makes sense. That dude is so insane, dog. He literally thinks he literally [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6389.24s)]
*  thinks the part of the school shooting was like fake or something. It was insane. Anyway, that guy, [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6395.24s)]
*  but also, yeah, I don't know, man. It's just, it's just wild. I think it's a, it's a perfect [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6399.88s)]
*  demonstration. Like Tim Walz was good pre-Kamala Harris campaign. Okay. Tim Walz bad post-Kamala [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6405.64s)]
*  Harris campaign. Make up your mind about this to me. It spells, you know, the Kamala Harris campaign [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6414.04s)]
*  is kind of cooking this dude, like his, his commentary on issues, the way he communicated [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6420.6s)]
*  issues that he cared about the way he spoke to them was significantly better. Oh wait, it's bad. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6425.64s)]
*  But look, the support of the democracy matters. It matters that you're here. And I'm as surprised [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6431.48s)]
*  as anybody of this coalition that Kamala Harris has built from Bernie Sanders to Dick Cheney to [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6437.0s)]
*  Taylor Swift and a whole bunch of folks and they don't all agree on everything, but they are truly [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6442.599999999999s)]
*  optimistic people. They believe in a positive future of this country and one where our politics [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6448.679999999999s)]
*  can be better than it is. And I have to tell you that, uh, that better than it is, is the sense of [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6454.2s)]
*  optimism that there can be an opportunity economy that works for everyone, not just to get by, [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6461.0s)]
*  but to get ahead. And the idea that freedom really means something, not the freedom of government to [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6466.84s)]
*  be in your bedroom or exam room, but the freedom for you to make choices about yourself. Now look, [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6471.8s)]
*  we all know who Donald Trump is. He's told us and as Maya Angelou said, believe him when he told you [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6476.76s)]
*  that his first inaugural address talked about American carnage. And then he sport spent four [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6482.44s)]
*  years trying to maybe do that. Senator Vance tonight made it clear. He will stand with Donald [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6487.8s)]
*  Trump's agenda. He will continue to push down that road. Excuse me. Kamala Harris gives us a different [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6493.8s)]
*  option. Now I'll have to tell you, I'm going to be careful about the quotes, but there's one that [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6500.4400000000005s)]
*  Senator Vance said that does resonate with me. He said Donald Trump makes the people I care about [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6504.360000000001s)]
*  afraid. A lot of America feels that way. We don't need to be afraid. Franklin Roosevelt was right. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6510.360000000001s)]
*  All we have to fear is fear itself. Kamala Harris is bringing us a new way forward. She's bringing [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6516.52s)]
*  us a politics of joy. She's bringing real solutions to the middle class and centering you at the heart [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6521.72s)]
*  of that all the while asking everyone join this movement, make your voices heard. Let's look for [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6527.64s)]
*  a new day where everybody gets that opportunity and everybody gets a chance to thrive. I humbly [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6534.76s)]
*  ask for your vote on November 5th for Kamala Harris. Governor Walz, thank you. Senator Vance, [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6540.68s)]
*  your closing statement. Well, I want to thank Governor Walz, you folks at CBS, and of course [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6546.2s)]
*  the American people for tuning in this evening. And one of the issues we didn't talk about was [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6551.0s)]
*  energy. And I remember when I was being raised by my grandmother when she didn't have enough money [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6554.76s)]
*  to turn on the heat some nights because Ohio gets pretty cold at night and because money was often [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6559.5599999999995s)]
*  very tight. And I believe as a person who wants to be your next vice president that we are a rich [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6564.44s)]
*  and prosperous enough country where every American, whether they're rich or poor, ought to be able to [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6570.2s)]
*  turn on their heat in the middle of a cold winter night. That's gotten more difficult thanks to [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6574.76s)]
*  Kamala Harris's energy policies. I believe that whether you're rich or poor, you ought to be able [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6579.16s)]
*  to afford a nice meal for your family. That's gotten harder because of Kamala Harris's policies. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6583.4800000000005s)]
*  I believe that whether you're rich or poor, you ought to be able to afford to buy a house. You [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6589.400000000001s)]
*  ought to be able to live in safe neighborhoods. You ought to not have your communities flooded [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6592.92s)]
*  with fentanyl. And that too has gotten harder with Kamala because of Kamala Harris's policies. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6596.92s)]
*  Now I've been in politics long enough to do what Kamala Harris does when she stands before [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6601.96s)]
*  the American people and says that on day one she's going to work on all these challenges I just listed. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6606.36s)]
*  She's been the vice president for three and a half years. Day one was 1,400 days ago and her policies [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6612.52s)]
*  have made these problems worse. Now I believe that we have the most beautiful country in the world. I [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6619.8s)]
*  meet people on the campaign trail who can't afford food but have the grace and generosity [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6625.48s)]
*  to ask me how I'm doing and to tell me they're praying for my family. What that has taught me [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6631.48s)]
*  is that we have the greatest country, the most beautiful country, the most incredible people [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6635.879999999999s)]
*  anywhere in the world. Give her money bro. She's dying. But they're not going to be able to achieve [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6640.839999999999s)]
*  their full dreams with the broken leadership that we have in Washington. They're not going to be [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6644.599999999999s)]
*  able to live their American dream if we do the same thing that we've been doing for the last [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6649.799999999999s)]
*  three and a half years. We need change. We need a new direction. We need a president who has already [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6654.12s)]
*  done this once before and did it well. Please vote for Donald Trump and whether you vote for me or [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6659.64s)]
*  vote for Tim Walz I just want to say I'm so proud to be doing this and I'm rooting for you. God bless [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6664.84s)]
*  you and good night. Senator Vance thank you. Oh my god. And thank you both for participating. Oh my god. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6669.8s)]
*  This debate won't move the needle but it's not a good thing okay because the needle has to move [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6675.88s)]
*  the needle has to move for the Democrats. It's not moving in a good direction. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6683.96s)]
*  You feel me? And oh my lord oh my god what an absolutely awful pathetic waste of time that was. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6689.08s)]
*  Holy dude oh my god I cannot be alone and feeling this way. Please like I know when we watch debates [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6698.679999999999s)]
*  like this when when debate time rolls around we got a lot of liberals in here right like a lot of [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6707.96s)]
*  people that normally don't tune in but just tune in for this type of okay and they're gonna get very [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6712.84s)]
*  mad at me when I say stuff like January 6th was objectively funny okay it was a debate in which [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6719.64s)]
*  like they're gonna get mad at me but beyond that kind of stuff one of the many ways beyond that [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6725.16s)]
*  kind of okay I personally think I personally think this is the Biden debate but this doesn't [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6729.88s)]
*  have any excuses I know I mean Tim Walz didn't do as poorly as like Donald Trump did obviously [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6739.88s)]
*  I just I hated it I hated it so much I hated it to the bottom from the bottom of my heart [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6747.64s)]
*  the Democratic party is so captured by right-wing sentiment so desperately trying to move the needle [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6754.2s)]
*  in the right-wing direction it was worse than you expected no I mean even before the debate I told [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6762.2s)]
*  you that Tim Walz was like neutered and he was going to be bad and that he was not a very good [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6766.76s)]
*  debater to begin with okay but oh my god every time they said I agree with you just like a little [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6772.6s)]
*  piece of me died I hope I'm not alone in this but like all of the high level like all of the most [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6778.68s)]
*  consequential stuff especially that was front-loaded because these debates usually they do that because [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6786.2s)]
*  by the time like the end of the debate rolls around nobody's paying attention okay what do you mean [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6791.0s)]
*  January 6 was so terrifying for democracy was one of the worst things to have in a recent history [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6795.48s)]
*  yeah dude they were going to be able to stop the process so that you know 330 million Americans [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6799.48s)]
*  would hallucinate an alternative reality where they didn't go out and vote and then Joe Biden [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6806.679999999999s)]
*  didn't win no that was the least consequential aspect of like Trump's election engineering okay [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6810.839999999999s)]
*  the more consequential stuff was the legal that he was trying to do behind the scenes where there [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6817.4s)]
*  is an active prosecution against that sort of thing despite the fact that it's been held up in [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6822.68s)]
*  the courts okay January 6 is objectively funny and one of the the aspects of this entire process [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6826.92s)]
*  like magically we're just going to forget if if the the the ballot if if Mike Pence followed through [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6833.320000000001s)]
*  on what Donald Trump wanted to do and just refused to authorize the ballots all of a sudden we're [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6842.4400000000005s)]
*  just going to forget that an election took place like get the hell out of here that's not going to [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6847.400000000001s)]
*  happen it's ridiculous okay they didn't even know what their goals were they were just a bunch of [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6849.88s)]
*  small business owners that were running around and ultimately just like took selfies inside of rooms [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6854.92s)]
*  and got maced okay yeah I will never you will never convince me that a bunch of fat business [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6860.84s)]
*  owners trying to climb the walls of the goddamn congress was not a hilarious moment okay anyway [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6866.52s)]
*  I have to fact check you January 6 was terrifying okay anyway like but regardless regardless [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6873.959999999999s)]
*  oh yeah yeah it's just [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUHtcwiaamw&t=6880.5199999999995s)]
