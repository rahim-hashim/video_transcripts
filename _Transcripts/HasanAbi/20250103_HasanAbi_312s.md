**HasanAbi:** [January 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA)
*  But the reason why the reason why my shins bleed is because of the bar path. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=0.0s)]
*  The bar path is supposed to go right against your shins. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=5.0s)]

*  Normally I wear pants when I deadlift didn't realize we were dead lifting. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=15.0s)]
*  Why did I wake up early? That's because this was my first day back in the gym. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=21.0s)]
*  During the holiday season my trainers took some time off. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=30.0s)]
*  I obviously didn't take time off but I did take time off from lifting. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=34.0s)]
*  I didn't take time off from training. I played basketball pretty much every single day. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=38.0s)]
*  Having said that however I had taken some time off from lifting. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=42.0s)]
*  But we're back baby and this is what the chatter was asking like why was your legs bleeding? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=48.0s)]
*  It's because I was putting up big joints. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=52.0s)]
*  Look at that. Stop and go. Stop and go. Not a moment wasted. Stop and go deadlifts baby. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=57.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=64.0s)]
*  Your shins are fragile. My shins are fragile. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=71.0s)]
*  Dude I'm putting up 385 pounds with ease. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=76.0s)]
*  I can still do like I can do 405 still. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=81.0s)]
*  I'm gonna I'm gonna build back up to it since I since I haven't in a while. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=85.0s)]
*  Barely any leg movement. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=90.0s)]
*  Lull. Dude this is a this is a solid deadlift. Please stop. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=92.0s)]
*  Wearing I had to hide the balding head receding hairline. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=100.0s)]
*  Yeah I know my balding head and my receding hairline is devastating. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=103.0s)]
*  I have to wear it had to hide it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=107.0s)]
*  Anyway isn't the mixed grip a killer for your back? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=109.0s)]
*  No mixed grip is not a killer for my back. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=114.0s)]
*  I forgot that I am supposed to start doing. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=117.0s)]
*  I forgot I'm gonna do strap. I'm gonna start using straps. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=121.0s)]
*  But the reason why the reason why my shins bleed is because of the bar path. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=128.0s)]
*  The bar path is supposed to go right against your shins. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=133.0s)]
*  And with my with my leg positioning with my leg positioning and my bar path. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=137.0s)]
*  Normally I wear pants when I deadlift didn't realize we were deadlifting today. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=144.0s)]
*  How much weight is that? It's not crazy. It's just 385. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=149.0s)]
*  It's just 385. It's not like the end of the world. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=152.0s)]
*  So what does this say about guys that are six four. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=156.0s)]
*  Oh I know what this is. I mean this is an old tweet. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=159.0s)]
*  He resurfaced this I think it just means we're gay as hell. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=163.0s)]
*  Brother I'm 511 and 210 and I can only deadlift 150. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=167.0s)]
*  No 385 is not that good for me weight wise for deadlifting 385 at my size. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=171.0s)]
*  I'm 225 to 230 pounds struggle for. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=180.0s)]
*  Thank you for the raid. Hope you had a good stream. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=185.0s)]
*  What's your PR? I've never really done a PR. I don't really do one rep PRs. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=187.0s)]
*  But how much do you this how much do you deadlift correlate with height. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=191.0s)]
*  Deadlift is the one lift where your height doesn't matter or could be a benefit I guess since you can put on more muscle mass and more weight. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=196.0s)]
*  Every other every other lift has diminishing returns with your height and can be a negative with your height. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=205.0s)]
*  For example bench press the shorter you are the smaller the bar path is with squatting. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=212.0s)]
*  The shorter you are the shorter the bar path is the distance traveled is shorter just get straps from when you go above 75 percent also height is actually typically a negative because of bar path. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=221.0s)]
*  Yeah but I guess with deadlifts it just doesn't I don't know it's supposed to be a negative as well. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=231.0s)]
*  Maybe I am personally better at my deadlifts than anything else. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=236.0s)]
*  And that's the reason why I don't mind it. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=242.0s)]
*  Straps equals bad grip. I never use straps. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=245.0s)]
*  I do use weight that weight belts at the at my top set. It's not bar path is range of motion fellas. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=248.0s)]
*  Yes you're right. Sorry it's range of motion longer range of motion when you're taller. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=254.0s)]
*  All right. You also have more mass to lift and pull ups. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=259.0s)]
*  That's true. So where was I. We're setting up stuff for Japan ahead of time as well. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=263.0s)]
*  Well I hired a fixer on the ground a friend of ours. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=271.0s)]
*  I'm Shane Gillis follows you on IG. No I followed him back on IG. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=274.0s)]
*  We found out out on the fear end episode last night. Why are you just saying that just now. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=278.0s)]
*  Anyway I hit him up because I want to I want to link up and build. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=282.0s)]
*  But anyway no those shoes are in no danger really right. Can relate been skating. Yeah no shins are fine. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=286.0s)]
*  Like yeah they get shins can eat a lot of damage. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=292.0s)]
*  I mean isn't that like what half of Muay Thai is is just busting out your shins. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=296.0s)]
*  But that's neither here nor there folks. That's it. This is a fit pic. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIpuij_eqNA&t=301.0s)]
