# Back From Ban | HasanAbi Reacts
**HasanAbi:** [May 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek)
*  The only reason why I was running ads was because I had a contract with Twitch. Once they no longer [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=0.0s)]
*  offered contracts, then there was no reason for me to run ads. I'm always going to be, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=4.64s)]
*  I'm always going to play ball with these platforms. Okay. I never wanted to run ads. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  I always got the contract minimum. I always negotiated the contract minimum. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=16.96s)]
*  That's precisely the reason why like a lot of [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=21.76s)]
*  of, and it turned into like with a couple of retakes in there, it turned into a 12 minute [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=23.76s)]
*  video, which was, I think pretty good. I probably should do that more often. You know, it's not that [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=36.800000000000004s)]
*  hard to host your own service, especially if you're the only person live. Yes, it is because a lot [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=44.72s)]
*  of you guys are completely oblivious to what advantages you get when you're on a massive [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=50.16s)]
*  platform. Okay. Getting an arena full of people, getting the word out to an arena full of people [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=55.599999999999994s)]
*  to come and find me is incredibly difficult. Like it's never going to happen. Okay. You have to be on, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=62.64s)]
*  you have to be on preexisting networks and preexisting platforms, whether it be AM radio, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  whether it be television, whether it be on all of these websites that exist, Twitch is not that [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=76.48s)]
*  massive. That's crazy to say, because it absolutely is that massive in comparison to my standalone [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=83.28s)]
*  platform that I try to design. I mean, are you crazy? It's just not happening. You're out of [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=91.04s)]
*  your mind. Like even a shift, even a shift away from Twitch to YouTube would be a seismic shift. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  Also, it's not just that I'm not just worried about like being deplatformed either. There's [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=103.52s)]
*  like more concern beyond being deplatformed concerns such as concerns such as, you know, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=108.08s)]
*  being potentially arrested. You know, these are, these are real issues. My point is that regardless [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=116.64s)]
*  of, regardless of these issues that even if I were to go away, even if I were to be arrested, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=123.92s)]
*  even if I had no other platform, no voice whatsoever, the truth does not change. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=129.44s)]
*  That was what I was trying to explain. Oh, calm down, bro. You're rich as [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=135.35999999999999s)]
*  yeah. I okay. All right. You're not wrong. I know this is part of the reason why your, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=140.96s)]
*  your subscriptions, your voluntary subscriptions that basically offer you only a little bit of [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=149.68s)]
*  amenities. I don't even run ads anymore. Right. At least back in the day, people were subscribing [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=156.48s)]
*  because they wanted to avoid the ads. Now they just subscribe to show support and to be able to [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=161.6s)]
*  use the emotes and to get these cool badges. Okay. You have to understand that like people, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=165.44s)]
*  you have to, you have to understand that that is that support that financial support is what gives [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=172.72s)]
*  me the editorial freedom and what allows me to, to withstand any sort of attacks. I strictly sub for [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=178.32s)]
*  no ads only thing going for subs. I beg you to do YouTube exclusive videos and no chat to distract [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=184.56s)]
*  you more often. You're on your a game. Yeah. Burgles. Thank you for the hundred community [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=189.28s)]
*  gift to subs. Yeah. The new Andrew Tate is if you get canceled, what's the plan? The new Andrew Tate [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=192.96s)]
*  you, I haven't gotten an ad in months. Did you get blacklisted? No. The reason why, well, first of [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=200.0s)]
*  all, I think you're subscribed. That's part of the reason I don't run ads anymore. Like I don't run [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=206.56s)]
*  ads at all. And not only do I not run ads, but also on top of that, on top of that, I'm on the, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=211.68s)]
*  the specific politics and sensitive social issues content label, which was directly created [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=220.24s)]
*  for people like myself. It was directly created as a consequence of people like freaking out [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=229.12s)]
*  and, and trying to go after advertisers on the platform. What you, the is a trafficker. What, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=234.48000000000002s)]
*  what are you saying? Anyway? Oh, oh, Andrew Tate. Yeah. So yeah. Okay. I got the brain worms. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=244.16000000000003s)]
*  Anyway, why did you stop showing ads? Just curious. I've talked about this before. I [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=252.0s)]
*  stopped running ads when my contract ended the real, the only reason why I was, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=257.04s)]
*  the only reason why I was running ads was because I had a contract with Twitch. Once they no longer [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=261.68s)]
*  offered contracts, then there was no reason for me to run ads. I'm always going to be, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=266.0s)]
*  I'm always going to play ball with these platforms. Okay. I never wanted to run ads. I always got the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=272.72s)]
*  contract minimum. I always negotiated the contract minimum. That's precisely the reason why, like a [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=279.2s)]
*  lot of how these things work would regularly get mad and talk about how like, Oh, socialist, but [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=284.96s)]
*  running ads for Amazon. Meanwhile, like everyone else was maxing out on, on the ads that they were, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=292.88s)]
*  that they were running on their streams. I literally had a three minute break and, and that was the [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=298.47999999999996s)]
*  contract minimum. The second time around on the first contract I got, I got a one minute break. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=304.71999999999997s)]
*  So, and I still try to like gamify it obviously, but ultimately, ultimately I, you know, I, I [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=308.8s)]
*  stop running ads as soon as my contract was over. There was no reason to do that. And [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=318.40000000000003s)]
*  Twitch doesn't offer contracts anymore. And so, you know, I have no incentive to run ads. I used [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=322.32s)]
*  to tell people to block ads by using an ad blocker. And then Twitch actually came down hard on me on [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=329.84000000000003s)]
*  that. And they were like, you can't tell people to use ad blockers. Are you insane? That's a violation [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=334.32s)]
*  as a breach of your contract, which I didn't know. So, you know, no matter what you hear about me [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=338.32s)]
*  from other people, it's probably the exact opposite. There's probably an explanation that [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=343.28s)]
*  makes sense. If you were to be charitable, you would shout that it's a contractual obligation [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=348.4s)]
*  right before the outbreak. I know, but it still didn't matter. So regardless, I'm like I've said, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=352.4s)]
*  I'm on a, I'm on a politics, like I have a politics marker, sensitive issues label regardless. And I [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=358.08s)]
*  don't think that they run ads on that politics and sensitive label issue anyway. Yes. I heard about [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=366.48s)]
*  Sam. I'm going to talk about that as well. It's very stupid thing that the Democrats have done. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=371.76s)]
*  Democrats still searching for a path forward after months of the six months later, Dems are still [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=376.56s)]
*  searching for a path forward is the name of the, is the, is the title of this article. It's like [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=381.6s)]
*  shockingly bad what the Dems are doing. As an advertiser, there's a sending in campaign set [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=388.24s)]
*  up to not show sensitive content. Yeah, exactly. Some I heard you were not a good person. IRL. I [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=392.88s)]
*  don't even know how a person would come to know that I'm not a good person in real life. Yeah. I [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=397.12s)]
*  don't think that that is a consistent thing that you've heard from people. If anything, it's [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=403.2s)]
*  probably, yeah, I know cams stuck out of focus. Yeah. Yeah. Someone will hear that. Will, will [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=410.08s)]
*  make a joke about me being autistic and then they'll take it. They'll take it seriously. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=416.72s)]
*  Anyway, blast off meme. I already, I already blasted off. I already did it early on. I said, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=424.08000000000004s)]
*  I'm back from my 24 hour suspension. Here it, here it is. My girlfriend doesn't like you because [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=430.88000000000005s)]
*  she's kind of a turf. She admits it though. That's crazy. Here's the blast off New York [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=435.20000000000005s)]
*  post wrote a piece on you returning already. Awesome. How was life away from the freak [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=440.72s)]
*  chatters pestering you? I, it was all right. I missed, I missed streaming. I should have, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=446.24s)]
*  I mean, I wanted to stream yesterday. Hey man, how you doing rough month, huh? Detained, defamed [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=452.72s)]
*  deep and banned. Haha. I mean, it's whatever it is, what it is. All the Twitter clips accounts [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=457.92s)]
*  celebrated your band. Like it was the end of world war II. I know they are, they have some of the [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=463.44s)]
*  worse politics online. So that's, that's, it's okay. They're popping off the worst, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=468.96s)]
*  the absolute worst people were cheering on the band. And now they're awfully quiet. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=475.59999999999997s)]
*  Law, like you're a freedom fighter or something. Clown. Did I say that? Did I say that? I'm a [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=483.12s)]
*  Twitch streamer. You're the one who's elevating my status in your mind. I'm just a Twitch streamer. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=488.4s)]
*  You're the one who thinks I'm a dangerous guy who must be eliminated. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=494.8s)]
*  All right, let's continue. Israeli strike, dozen sheltering in Gaza school officials say. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=499.20000000000005s)]
*  Welcome back. Let's return to our [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5eMxufXcek&t=505.44s)]
