**HasanAbi:** [September 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI)
*  dance. You know what I mean? I don't think I shall have any problems reproducing the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=0.0s)]
*  sound for your enjoyment. In the musical of my mind, I had majesty by Eminem and Nikki [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=4.04s)]
*  as like our song for a while because of Eminem's part of the lyrics. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=10.08s)]
*  No! I have chills, bro. I have full body chills. I'm not even kidding. Oh my God. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=15.24s)]
*  I just want to talk about Cutie Cinderella really quickly. Okay, because [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=36.96s)]
*  I'm not the only one who pre watches apparently Cutie Cinderella pre watch [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=40.88s)]
*  Goon Goon. Okay. Also, the Macy's thank you for the fat playlist. We'll get to [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  that in a second. All right. Here's the three minute break now. All right, let's [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=51.36s)]
*  get into it. We're going to talk about Goon Goon because it's not a good take. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=55.160000000000004s)]
*  Good friends. It's such a normal take. Correct you when you have insane. I need [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=59.28s)]
*  a girl. So do you do you think Moon Moon is guilty of I don't know what is he [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=63.68000000000001s)]
*  doing? Oh yeah. Moon Moon has an Irish girlfriend. Yes. We like literally [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=68.44s)]
*  verbatim says he rocks her world. Does he have a girlfriend IRL? Goon Goon TLDR [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=74.44s)]
*  Goon Goon was flirting with his RP wife offline for the past 10 months and [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=80.56s)]
*  separated with his actual wife two months ago. RP wife is married to someone [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=83.16s)]
*  IRL for 15 years and husband found out from discord DMS that they fit to [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=85.96s)]
*  wish on RP wife told Goon Goon that she's in an open marriage but husband [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=88.56s)]
*  denies that relationship is an open marriage. Okay, that seems to be the that [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=92.36s)]
*  summary. I trust my mods on this because they're all Moon Moon heads like they [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=96.96000000000001s)]

*  the same boomer sensibilities. We have a lot of crossover with Moon Moon and we [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=108.12s)]
*  have a lot of crossover with Northern Lion and also because I'm a I'm a [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=113.36s)]

*  quick to suggest that I am a misogynist because of the fact that I have 3.4% [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=378.72s)]
*  female viewership. Has anyone ever stopped to consider that maybe I'm the [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=384.44s)]
*  victim here and women just aren't with bald men? Maybe maybe women are baldest [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=389.48s)]

*  through that actual one. Come on, chatter. You can't be for real. You [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=421.04s)]
*  actually thought my friend Alex posted a real part of the indictment between [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=425.92s)]
*  where I am directly named as a as a co conspirator like you. Oh my god. Oh my [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=434.56s)]

*  Okay, so thank you chatter. It's like this is the reverse of like whenever I [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=454.68s)]
*  say something and someone will take it like super literally and be like, um, I [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=459.91999999999996s)]
*  know you probably made a joke here, but I absolutely disagree with the statement [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=464.84s)]
*  that you made and I'm going to take it seriously like you are being serious. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=469.03999999999996s)]
*  Like this is the funniest. This is the best outcome of this is the best outcome [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=472.36s)]
*  of having a massive neurodivergent community. Oh, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=477.88s)]
*  head. I think I'm the victim here, man. You got it all twisted. You were you [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=481.76s)]
*  were saying I don't like women. That's not true, man. Women don't like me. I'm [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=487.28s)]
*  the victim here. I'm flipping the script on him. I would love to have more female [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=492.12s)]
*  viewers, but unfortunately, they're just not with my hairstyle. You know what's [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=497.91999999999996s)]
*  throwing me for a loop. I did a co op dolls video with Apollo on my end, 8% [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=502.0s)]
*  female viewership on his end, 32% female viewership. It's the same video, dude. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=508.32s)]
*  The only difference it's an it's an a B test. My version has a bald man in the [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=515.28s)]
*  corner. His version doesn't very interesting. Women are not beating the [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=520.6800000000001s)]
*  allegations, man. They're baldest. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=526.24s)]
*  I think women need to answer for their third of not watching Mr. Bellotro. Okay, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=529.88s)]
*  why aren't women not sitting around and watching this bald man play Bellotro? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=535.48s)]
*  Listen, listen, listen. If Northern Lion has zero fans, that means I am dead. Okay, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=543.32s)]
*  that's all I'm gonna say. This moment clip didn't age well. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=550.12s)]
*  Wouldn't someone who loves his wife so much, comma not risk losing all that by [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=553.5600000000001s)]
*  role playing a fake relationship. One, I super love my wife and I am in a we are [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=559.3199999999999s)]
*  in a very, very good relationship that does not require my way. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=567.68s)]
*  Oh, no. You'd be surprised how many RP folks do weird on servers. Bro, the [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=573.88s)]
*  weirdest I did when I was doing RP would be like wake up and grind before I [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=579.3199999999999s)]
*  started streaming. And that's when I that's when I personally recognize like [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=584.44s)]
*  I have real issues like I am deeply addicted. I'm deeply addicted to the [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=588.84s)]
*  process. Like I need to get out of this and I need to be my own man again. Did [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=594.5200000000001s)]
*  you get married to an anime girl? Yeah, but it was all like, you could probably [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=599.44s)]
*  tell I was always like kind of uncomfortable doing that stuff. Even [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=603.7600000000001s)]
*  though people were like really looking for it. I remember, like it was if you [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=606.8800000000001s)]
*  watched me play if you watch me play back then you probably recognize like I [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=613.24s)]
*  always was like very, very like it was my least favorite part of role play. And I [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=617.12s)]
*  felt bad because like, you know, anime was a was a great person overall, but I [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=622.6400000000001s)]
*  would always like run away from her because I just didn't know how to like [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=627.6400000000001s)]
*  do. I didn't know how to do that kind of role play. It was. Yeah, that's why I was [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=630.1600000000001s)]
*  like I'm asexual. Unless you were flirting with the boys. Yeah, I mean, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=636.44s)]
*  that's obviously easy. It was not like a real relationship RP for sure. Like [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=640.24s)]
*  these people go in depth into their like relationship role play stuff. I don't [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=646.0s)]
*  know. It's just not for me. It's I never liked it. I thought it was like weird. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=652.0s)]
*  Like, are you talking to the role play girl? Like, that's that's the difference [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=656.4399999999999s)]
*  between you me is that I am I'm trying to role play character. I have no feelings [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=660.92s)]
*  for the person on the other end of my role play characters. I have no [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=664.76s)]
*  intentions of speaking. I'm trying to role play a character. Oh, God, come on, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=667.64s)]
*  man. Remember you guys had a patreon episode of fear and and cutie brought up [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=672.1999999999999s)]
*  being uncomfortable with a partner role playing a relationship with a totally [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=676.48s)]
*  different person a cutie cutie called the cutie absolved you and will were [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=678.92s)]
*  laughing at her for that take vindication. Yeah, I mean, I, I don't [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=681.92s)]
*  personally care. I don't personally care about it. But overall, you know, I [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=686.84s)]
*  think that there are a ton of people who do it. But like, don't take it to [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=693.0s)]
*  like weird lengths. You know what I mean? He's RPing with both of them, by the [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=697.76s)]
*  way. He's the other fake Irish into the amount of character any more than is [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=701.76s)]
*  necessary, which I don't. You're you're projecting what you would be doing in my [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=706.12s)]
*  situation. We're not the same. I am. Yeah, you called her crazy for and you verbatim [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=712.12s)]
*  said what is he gonna do ruin his life? No way. Yeah, I was wrong. I'll take that [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=716.6s)]
*  I mean, did he ruin his life? I don't think he ruined his life at all. Like, this [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=720.72s)]
*  is one of those situations where it's like, like, this is moon did say they [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=726.8000000000001s)]
*  didn't interact outside of RP and even as fan back that up. Remember when moon [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=733.5600000000001s)]
*  went on your stream and talk about the election? So the thing is, the thing is [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=737.4000000000001s)]
*  like moon moon moon moon had a wife and a child and was playing video games 15 [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=743.5200000000001s)]
*  hours out of the day. You know what I mean? So I don't know if it's the RP [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=749.72s)]
*  that ruined their relationship or it was just the fact that he was again, playing [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=753.88s)]
*  video games for 15 hours a day that might have cooked the relationship. So [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=757.72s)]
*  it's one of those moments where it's like did did he did it was it actually the RP [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=763.28s)]
*  or or was it just like what he does for a living? And then beyond that, beyond [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=768.4s)]
*  his life. I mean, like he went to he went to pound town, but he ruined maybe [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=776.3199999999999s)]
*  someone else's life. I don't think he ruined his own life. Maybe the RP was the [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=781.6s)]
*  tipping point. Moon was it his wife said he wasn't putting in the effort and [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=785.92s)]
*  that's why they got separated. Hasan is failing to understand the zoomers are [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=790.16s)]
*  hyper critical of cheaters over any other common person you commit. I think [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=793.0799999999999s)]
*  it's like, I think my brain is so busted from like, you know, watching fathers [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=796.1999999999999s)]
*  pick up their children in trash bags every day from American, you know, Boeing [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=803.24s)]
*  rockets that are deployed on top of civilian areas that like, not to get super [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=809.1999999999999s)]
*  real for you for a moment. But whenever I hear like someone chirp about like age [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=814.0s)]
*  gap relationships or chirp about divorce, I'm like, it's like kind of funny in [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=818.36s)]
*  comparison to like all this other like it's still bad. It's still up. But like, I [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=822.92s)]
*  think I'm so desensitized to like interpersonal problems like this, from [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=827.52s)]
*  all of the real hardcore awful that happens on a daily basis. And I think it's [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=833.12s)]
*  probably not healthy that like, I need to adjust myself. I need to adjust myself to, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=839.6s)]
*  you know, to like normal people standards, right? But yeah, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=846.96s)]
*  the goat, you are a jerk off, dude, parasol. Wouldn't someone who loves his [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=850.92s)]
*  wife so much me too, bro, I've let go of all angry and negative emotions in my [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=857.0s)]
*  personal life, because I realized doesn't matter. I just get mad at the [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=860.72s)]
*  existential. But yeah, well, Jesus, yeah, anything in the lens of that is going to [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=863.16s)]
*  look ridiculous. Definitely not healthy to fixate on streamers personal lives, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=867.92s)]
*  though, just call him a loser and move on. Yeah, I think we're all we're all [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=870.88s)]
*  losers for knowing about this and caring about this. A lot of stuff that we do is [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=876.12s)]
*  very is in the pocket of loserdom, if I'm being really real. But I think people [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=881.8s)]
*  are invested in the drama of it all. I don't know. I feel bad for the other guy, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=887.68s)]
*  though. One of those is one of those unique moments where it's like, is one of [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=892.9599999999999s)]
*  those what he's trying to glaze MBs after erasing them, read them and don't [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=896.8s)]
*  weep, but gloat a little bit less than you were gloating before. Okay, there it [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=901.4799999999999s)]
*  is. 7.2% female, 91.2% male, 1.7% user specified, which I'm just gonna say is [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=905.32s)]
*  female, because it helps my case. He just deleted non binary people. No, Ghibli, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=916.12s)]
*  you're right. Non binary viewers are even more valuable than women viewers. 1.2 1.2 [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=921.0400000000001s)]
*  1.2% non binary viewers. Holy man, we're we're cooking. You saved me, man. You [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=929.8s)]
*  saved me. You can't say that. Oh, grow up. I'll say anything. I can say whatever I [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=938.36s)]
*  want. I want more straight male viewers. Boo. But I want disproportionately more [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=943.9599999999999s)]
*  viewers across the spectrum of diversity so that the proportion of straight male [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=952.24s)]
*  viewers gets smaller over time. There you go. Cancel this guy for being bald. Yeah, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=957.0799999999999s)]
*  he actually has hair. He's just he literally shaves it off. It's really tough. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=964.36s)]
*  Why is it that when we talk Mumu and chatters link Northern lion chatters think [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=969.4399999999999s)]
*  all balls are the same? I mean, true. Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay, we're moving away [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=973.16s)]
*  from that. You should do more collabs in Northern lion. I want to I tried to I [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=977.4s)]
*  have literally hit him up. I think he is very similar to me in the sense that he [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=984.76s)]
*  has like a program, a rigid work structure, and a as healthy of a work life [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=989.3199999999999s)]
*  balance as you can have beyond that rigid work structure. So like he just [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=996.36s)]
*  does not. He doesn't he he doesn't step outside of his space. Um, but I but I [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=1001.64s)]
*  also think like, I don't know, it might be maybe he just like, maybe he just might [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=1008.88s)]
*  be worried about like, additional scrutiny that he might get from from a [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=1014.04s)]
*  lot of my rabbit haters or whatever. And I don't want to put that on anybody. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=1020.56s)]
*  That's why I'm always very careful with my collabs. Because like my community [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=1024.36s)]
*  is awesome. And they're incredibly kind to everyone I collaborate with. But [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=1028.28s)]
*  overall, I could totally see why someone would be worried about getting like, I [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=1033.84s)]
*  don't know, immediately doxed and swatted or something for being in my being in [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=1038.56s)]
*  being in the periphery is a wife and kids your schedules don't mesh well with [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=1044.12s)]
*  how he and you structure your stream times. Yeah, wait, wait question. How do [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=1047.9599999999998s)]
*  you actually deal with that? Like the haters hating the people you collab [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=1051.8s)]
*  with? Your chat is just woke scold along with your haters being obnoxious not [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=1054.32s)]

*  Valkyra or something like that's not going to happen or Tina Kitten. Yeah, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=1073.0s)]
*  there's a lot of overlap between our communities in general. My chatters woke [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=1077.72s)]
*  scold you a lot. You Yeah, this chat is really mean to me. They didn't will get [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyicllDtwKI&t=1082.36s)]
