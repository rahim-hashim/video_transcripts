# 'Gross overreach of the Executive Branch': Anger at GOP town halls over Trump policies
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E)
*  Rowdy, combative, even some violence in town halls across the country yesterday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=0.0s)]
*  That first clip you saw was from Georgia at a town hall for Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=5.2s)]
*  Greene. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  At least six people were escorted out by police. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Three, at least, were arrested. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=12.92s)]
*  Two, even shocked with a taser. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  On the other side of the aisle, former President Joe Biden reentered the political world, giving [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=18.16s)]
*  his first post-presidency speech, where he slammed President Trump over cuts to Social [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=21.68s)]
*  Security. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=26.32s)]
*  Joining us now is Julie Roginsky, Democratic strategist, author of the salty politics [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=28.0s)]
*  newsletter and Lindsay Draft, former regional finance director for Mitt Romney's campaign. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=32.2s)]
*  I thank you both for being here with me. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=36.96s)]
*  Lindsay, there's a longer moment from Senator Grassley's town hall where he was pressed [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=39.040000000000006s)]
*  about the lack of due process for Abrego Garcia's case. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=44.06s)]
*  Let's listen to that. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=47.32000000000001s)]
*  Are you going to bring that guy back from El Salvador? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=48.32000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=53.32000000000001s)]
*  Why not? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=54.32s)]
*  Well, because that's not a power of Congress. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=59.32s)]
*  The Supreme Court said to bring him back. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=63.32s)]
*  Yeah, but, uh, what can they do? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=66.32s)]
*  He's defying the Constitution. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=70.32s)]
*  Trump don't care. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=72.32s)]
*  What do you think, Lindsay? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=74.32s)]
*  Is this something that is going to continue having or playing a larger part, having a [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=76.32s)]
*  bigger impact? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=82.32s)]
*  I think that what we're seeing right now is a gross overreach of the executive branch [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=83.32s)]
*  because you have a legislative branch that is failing to actually address key issues. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=88.32s)]
*  You have a legislative branch right now that is, uh, it is having people in Congress who [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=93.32s)]
*  are there from gerrymandered districts with closed primary systems. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=99.32s)]
*  They are scared to do anything because they're scared to lose their jobs. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=103.32s)]
*  I give great kudos to Senator Grassley for hosting this town hall and Congressman Maast. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=106.32s)]
*  Maybe not Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene as she took pre-screened questions, so it [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=111.32s)]
*  was not a responsive engagement. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=118.32s)]
*  But what Senator Grassley said really stood out to me, which is that this is not Congress's [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=120.32s)]
*  power. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=124.32s)]
*  Congress has great collective power. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=125.32s)]
*  It is choosing not to use it. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=126.32s)]
*  And if you look at what happened last week with the 90-day suspension of the tariffs, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=128.32s)]
*  that's actually an example of Congress's collective power. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=132.32s)]
*  They came together quietly. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=135.32s)]
*  Even though that was an executive decision? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=136.32s)]
*  It was an executive decision, but it was because of pressure placed on the executive branch [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=137.32s)]
*  by the members of the Republican Senate. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=142.32s)]
*  They have the opportunity to do this, and I think that the more town halls we host and [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=144.32s)]
*  the more public sentiment that comes behind this, we will start to see an opportunity [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=148.32s)]
*  for them to exert that collective power. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=153.32s)]
*  And so, Julie, do you think that the Democrats have been exerting their collective power, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=155.32s)]
*  even though they're in the minority in the Senate and the House and clearly in the White [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=160.32s)]
*  House, have they been exerting their collective power adequately? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=163.32s)]
*  Not enough. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=167.32s)]
*  I think there are certain senators like Cory Booker, who obviously showed a roadway, a [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=168.32s)]
*  pathway to doing that. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=172.32s)]
*  25 hours. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=173.32s)]
*  25 hours. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=174.32s)]
*  I'm not suggesting every senator filibuster or have to do a floor speech for 25 hours, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=175.32s)]
*  but there are things that they can do to gum up the works until Chuck Grassley, who sits [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=178.32s)]
*  on the Judiciary Committee, realizes he has tremendous power to force the president's [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=183.32s)]
*  hand to do something. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=187.32s)]
*  He doesn't have to get any nominees through the Judiciary Committee until the president [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=188.32s)]
*  returns on Briego Garcia and does other things that Congress would want him to do. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=191.32s)]
*  Democrats need to understand that this is not a time to sit and have a kumbaya moment [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=196.32s)]
*  with Republicans on anything. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=201.32s)]
*  They need to gum up the works and use every legislative means at their disposal to gum [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=203.32s)]
*  up the works until this lawlessness ends. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=207.32s)]
*  And gum up what works? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=209.32s)]
*  And to what degree do you gum up? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=211.32s)]
*  How do you gum up the works? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=213.32s)]
*  There is nothing going on right now. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=214.32s)]
*  Well, first of all, they have many recourses, especially in the Senate, to be able to do [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=215.32s)]
*  that, right? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=218.32s)]
*  Cory Booker showed one pathway to doing that. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=219.32s)]
*  They have blue slips they can do in appointees. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=220.32s)]
*  There are many, many things that they can do. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=222.32s)]
*  Not enough, obviously. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=224.32s)]
*  They're in the minority, but there are tactics that they can take. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=225.32s)]
*  The problem here is that this is a president that is completely lawless, whether it's Briego [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=227.32s)]
*  Garcia, whether it's these renditions to without any due process, whether it is allowing Elon [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=232.32s)]
*  Musk to steal people's personal information, whether it is effectively stopping... [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=237.32s)]
*  Steal people's? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=241.32s)]
*  Of course. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=242.32s)]
*  He's got people from Doge coming in to all of these departments, taking people's personal [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=243.32s)]
*  information, doing God knows what with it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=247.32s)]
*  They have no authority to be able to do that, but they're doing that right now. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=249.32s)]
*  You have people coming in right now and cutting off workers of Social Security agencies so [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=252.32s)]
*  that people can't apply for those Social Security benefits. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=258.32s)]
*  There are all sorts of things that are happening right now that are completely outside the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=260.32s)]
*  norm. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=265.32s)]
*  And until Congress realizes that they need to act as a co-equal branch of government [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=266.32s)]
*  and stop bending the knee to this executive, we're not going to be able to stop any of [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=269.32s)]
*  this from happening, and our democracy is going to be slipping away. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=273.32s)]
*  I want to play for you part of what former President Biden said in his first speech. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=275.32s)]
*  Since leaving the White House. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=279.32s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=281.32s)]
*  Social Security is more than a government program. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=283.32s)]
*  It's a sacred promise we made it a day, a sacred promise. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=285.32s)]
*  Fewer than 100 days. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=290.32s)]
*  This new administration has made so much damage and so much destruction. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=292.32s)]
*  Lizzie, is this a message that's going to be getting through? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=300.32s)]
*  I mean, is this part of the consistent message of Democrats? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=303.32s)]
*  It's not going to be a message that's getting through, and the Democrats don't have a [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=307.32s)]
*  consistent message. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=310.32s)]
*  You're looking at the former president speaking out for the first time since he's left office, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=311.32s)]
*  and Democrats are receiving this with very mixed emotions. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=316.32s)]
*  This is a man they hold in high regard and they love very much, but at the same time, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=320.32s)]
*  they blame him for exactly where we are right now as a nation. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=323.32s)]
*  I have to disagree, Julie, with the idea that Democrats need to be gumming up the system. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=326.32s)]
*  I think actually we have a great opportunity right now as Americans, and especially in our [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=331.32s)]
*  legislative branches, to come together to advance real long-term solutions. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=335.32s)]
*  How do you do that, though? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=339.32s)]
*  You have to caucus together, and you have to be willing to take votes that might lose you your job. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=340.32s)]
*  These folks are all worried that they're going to come back into their districts and they're going to [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=345.32s)]
*  get primaried either from the left or the right. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=348.32s)]
*  And if you look right now at the crowds that AOC and Bernie Sanders are getting together, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=350.32s)]
*  this furthers our idea here that the Democratic Party doesn't have a strong identity, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=353.32s)]
*  and they're having a very difficult time building a coalition. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=358.32s)]
*  Instead of working to build those coalitions just within the parties, how about a coalition of Americans? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=361.32s)]
*  You know, just when you were speaking about that, let's take a look at the scene in California. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=366.32s)]
*  I mean, this was just yesterday, and we're talking about thousands of people. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=371.32s)]
*  Thirty thousand came out to rally with Senator Sanders and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=376.32s)]
*  Here's a bit of what was talked about there. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=383.32s)]
*  We will not accept authoritarianism. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=385.32s)]
*  And we will not accept a rigged economy where working people struggle while billionaires become richer. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=390.32s)]
*  Community is the most powerful building block we have to defeat authoritarianism and root out corruption. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=401.32s)]
*  Julie, there's a contrast there. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=410.32s)]
*  Well, and to the point that Lindsay was making, actually, I disagree with some of what you said. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=413.32s)]
*  Democrats right now are looking for fighters. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=418.32s)]
*  And Bernie Sanders and AOC, who are not necessarily everybody's cup of tea in the Democratic Party, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=420.32s)]
*  are gaining so much traction right now, including from establishment people like me, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=427.32s)]
*  because they're fighting, because they're not doing what Chuck Schumer did a month or so ago [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=431.32s)]
*  where he's going along with a continuing resolution to fund this government. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=436.32s)]
*  People are looking at the Democratic Party for somebody to stand up to Donald Trump effectively. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=439.32s)]
*  They're not looking for anybody to make common cause with a man who's destroying our democracy, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=444.32s)]
*  not even piece by piece, but in the last almost 100 days, almost wholeheartedly. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=448.32s)]
*  And so this is what Democrats need right now. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=453.32s)]
*  This is what they're fighting for. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=456.32s)]
*  This is what they're thirsting for. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=457.32s)]
*  And I strongly urge Democrats in the Senate and the House to take a look at what Bernie Sanders [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=459.32s)]
*  and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are doing and emulate it, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=463.32s)]
*  because what voters want right now is somebody to stand up to the horror show [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=466.32s)]
*  that's been inflicted on this country for the last 60, 70 days. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=470.32s)]
*  Well, and I look at what's coming out of the DNC right now politically. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=474.32s)]
*  I think the chairman of the DNC acknowledges that there is not a figurehead right now for the Democratic Party. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=477.32s)]
*  And these far-left progressive voices are not resonating with the majority of Americans, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=483.32s)]
*  which is why the Harris campaign tacked so centrously in terms of really to the center in her messaging as a candidate. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=487.32s)]
*  And you've got now the chairman of the DNC saying they're going to actively primary people within their own party. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=494.32s)]
*  The party system itself has taken our democracy from us as American voters. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=499.32s)]
*  So gumming up the system and playing games in the short term is not going to fix it. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=504.32s)]
*  I wish we could continue our conversation. We will going forward. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=509.32s)]
*  I thank you both so very much. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=512.3199999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cc3HX2j_9E&t=524.32s)]
