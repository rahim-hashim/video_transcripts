# Death toll from Texas flooding tops 100 as search for survivors continues
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU)
*  I need to tell my community and those families who are waiting, this will be a rough week. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=0.0s)]
*  Primary search continues and we remain hopeful every foot, every mile, every bend of the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=9.28s)]
*  river. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=17.48s)]
*  It's the mayor of Kerrville, Texas speaking to his community in the wake of the devastating [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=18.48s)]
*  flash flooding that swept through the region. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=23.5s)]
*  The question is, why weren't the warnings enough to save more lives? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=26.04s)]
*  Plus, President Trump welcomes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=29.96s)]
*  The question is, was any progress actually made toward a ceasefire agreement in Gaza? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  And after nearly two decades, the TSA is phasing out its shoe removal policy at airports. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=39.56s)]
*  The question is, will this make those security lines move any faster? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=44.96s)]
*  It's way too early for this. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=49.16s)]
*  Good morning and welcome to Way Too Early, the show that's happy to keep its shoes on [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=56.76s)]
*  at the airport. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=63.44s)]
*  Come on, guys. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=64.44s)]
*  I'm Ali Vitale on this Tuesday, July 8th, and we're going to get right to it with the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=65.44s)]
*  news. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=69.0s)]
*  We start this morning with the latest out of central Texas, where the death toll from [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=70.14s)]
*  the devastating flooding has now risen to more than 100 people across six counties. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  The majority of those killed were in storm ravaged Kerr County, where local officials [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=79.34s)]
*  say 28 children are among the dead. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=83.4s)]
*  That county houses Camp Mystic, the beloved nearly century old summer camp for girls, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=86.28s)]
*  which said yesterday that it's grieving the loss of 27 campers and counselors following [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=91.12s)]
*  the catastrophic flooding on the Guadalupe River. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=95.34s)]
*  Ten girls and one counselor from the camp are still missing. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=98.48s)]
*  And this morning, we're learning more about some of the victims of this deadly storm that [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=102.08000000000001s)]
*  swept through parts of the state. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=105.52000000000001s)]
*  There are people like Blair and Brooke Harbor, just 13 and 11 years old, who were vacationing [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=107.96000000000001s)]
*  with their family in Hunt, Texas. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=112.1s)]
*  That was when rain came pounding and floodwater ripped through the area. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=114.53999999999999s)]
*  When rescuers recovered their bodies on Saturday, the sisters were found with their hands locked [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=118.5s)]
*  together, according to a relative. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=122.58s)]
*  These stories are horrible and heartbreaking. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=124.58s)]
*  Now four days out from the raging flood, rescue crews are not giving up, continuing to comb [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=127.1s)]
*  through the region to search for survivors. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=131.85999999999999s)]
*  But more rain is expected in central Texas over the coming days. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=134.26s)]
*  The National Weather Service extended some flood watches and warnings through Thursday, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=137.92s)]
*  telling residents to remain vigilant. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=142.06s)]
*  Meanwhile, as some officials in Texas continue to criticize the National Weather Service [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=144.06s)]
*  in the aftermath of those fatal floods, an investigation by NBC Dallas Fort Worth found [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=148.02s)]
*  that the agency first issued a warning 12 hours ahead of the surging waters. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=152.70000000000002s)]
*  Troy Kimmel, who's an Austin-based meteorologist and emergency manager, told NBC he believes [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=157.82000000000002s)]
*  the weather service issued timely alerts with the best information they had available. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=162.54000000000002s)]
*  But the big question remains here. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=167.10000000000002s)]
*  Did those alerts reach the people they needed the most, that needed it the most? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=168.82s)]
*  Hard-hit Kerr County does not have a weather siren system, in part because some local officials [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=173.22s)]
*  felt it was too expensive to install. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=177.78s)]
*  The weather service says it added key words to a late-night warning to automatically trigger [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=180.29999999999998s)]
*  wireless alerts on cell phones and weather radios in the area. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=184.22s)]
*  But at Camp Mystic, for example, where cell phones weren't allowed, or in other rural [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=187.94s)]
*  areas of the county with limited service, many may not have received those alerts at [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=192.1s)]
*  all. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=196.38s)]
*  Meanwhile, one Texas town had something its nearby neighbors didn't. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=197.38s)]
*  Comfort, Texas, recently updated its disaster alert system, installing a new siren in the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=200.74s)]
*  Volunteer Fire Department's headquarters and moving the old one to a low-lying area of [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=205.78s)]
*  town. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=210.1s)]
*  Friday was the first time that this new two-tiered siren system was used. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=211.1s)]
*  Officials say no one in Comfort died as a result of the floods. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=215.46s)]
*  Joining us now, NBC News senior national correspondent Jay Gray, live with us from Kerrville, Texas. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=219.78s)]
*  Jay, what's the latest where you are? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=224.46s)]
*  Well, I can tell you, Allie, it's early in the morning here, but we've already seen two [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=227.38s)]
*  choppers passing overhead. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=234.06s)]
*  So the search, the rescue and recovery is still going on around the clock here. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=235.74s)]
*  And I want to give you a look at some of the devastation firsthand. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=241.74s)]
*  This from a home that was inundated by water and mud. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=244.68s)]
*  It's along the river. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=248.94s)]
*  That water came through and up over 100 yards from the river and poured through. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=250.66s)]
*  You can see everything that's been pulled out of this home, all of the debris. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=255.78s)]
*  But in reality, people's lives, the family did escape as the water moved in. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=260.78s)]
*  And now they begin to work as this search and recovery we talk about, Allie, really [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=266.68s)]
*  settles into what is a somber and very painful rhythm here. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=272.34s)]
*  You talked about those that have perished in the flooding and aftermath. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=278.94s)]
*  For 106 counties and officials yesterday for the first time told us they're not real [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=284.14s)]
*  sure on those that are missing, that they don't have a solid number they can share right [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=289.94s)]
*  now. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=294.86s)]
*  What they did say, and I'm quoting here, is it's a lot, dozens, according to some, who [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=295.86s)]
*  are still missing and still the subject of these searches. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=300.88s)]
*  So I think we're going to see that continue for quite some time. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=305.78s)]
*  As the mayor said, coming into all of this, it's going to be a tough week that's going [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=309.18s)]
*  to extend into a tough recovery. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=313.3s)]
*  I mean, people going through all of this, the survivors, and when you look at the debris [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=315.58s)]
*  here, it's hard to say this, but they say they are the lucky ones with all that's been [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=321.18s)]
*  lost here. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=326.3s)]
*  And now they must try and somehow make the turn to begin some type of recovery. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=327.41999999999996s)]
*  But it's going to be long, it's going to be difficult, and they're going to need some [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=333.97999999999996s)]
*  help, Allie. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=337.68s)]
*  Yeah, but we've also heard about the resilience of this community. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=338.68s)]
*  Jay, can you talk about some of the conversations that you've had with folks there who know [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=341.86s)]
*  that they've got a long road ahead, but who are deeply resilient people? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=345.42s)]
*  No one that I've spoken with here on the ground over the last several days has said, I'm [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=353.5s)]
*  packing it up. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=358.15999999999997s)]
*  I can't come back. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=359.15999999999997s)]
*  Everyone, to a man and woman, has said, we are going to rebuild, we're going to be back. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=360.3s)]
*  A woman told me yesterday, look, we're forever changed here, and this community is forever [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=365.46s)]
*  changed. But we are strong, and it doesn't mean that we won't rebuild, that we won't [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=370.5s)]
*  be a part of what's going to come here in the aftermath of this storm. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=376.54s)]
*  They say they'll never forget the victims and that a lot of what they do here and the [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=382.3s)]
*  reason they persist is to honor those who've been lost. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=386.72s)]
*  I talked to a lady who was here helping an elderly couple clean out what was left inside [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=390.70000000000005s)]
*  their home. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=396.86s)]
*  She came from Corpus Christi. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=397.98s)]
*  It's a long way away from where we are right now, but she said, I had to be a part of helping [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=399.38s)]
*  this community. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=403.97999999999996s)]
*  They helped me during Hurricane Harvey, and I want to repay that. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=405.35999999999996s)]
*  I want to pay it forward. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=409.5s)]
*  And you see so many volunteers pouring into this area with similar stories that just want [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=411.34s)]
*  to be a part of making sure this community can get through what's, again, going to be [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=416.4s)]
*  a difficult struggle, but no one backing down from that. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=420.78s)]
*  Their hearts are broken, one of the victims told me, but their spirit is not. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=423.65999999999997s)]
*  NBC News Senior National Correspondent Jay Gray looking for the helpers reporting live [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=429.73999999999995s)]
*  this morning from Kerrville, Texas. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=434.29999999999995s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVXMvDNj6vU&t=435.85999999999996s)]
