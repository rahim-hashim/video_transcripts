# Wall Street Update: Markets drop amid concerns Trump’s megabill will hurt deficit
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210)
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson and the Freedom Caucus are headed to the White House, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=0.0s)]
*  summoned by the President to get a scolding on the still-not-past spending bill. Joining us now, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=3.6s)]
*  advisor to Senator Bernie Sanders and executive director of the nonprofit news organization, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  More Perfect Union, Fazz Shakir. Ashley Parker and David Fromm are still with us as well. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=13.52s)]
*  All right, Fazz, you're the new guy in the group. Thanks for joining us. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=19.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=23.119999999999997s)]
*  This spending bill is something that Democrats are going to try to use to their advantage. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=24.32s)]
*  They're going to say, they don't want it to pass, but they're going to say if it does pass, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=30.0s)]
*  that this is going to take benefits away from the working class and it's going to do it at the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=34.239999999999995s)]
*  expense of, or it's going to do it in service of tax cuts for the very rich. How complicated [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=40.64s)]
*  is the messaging on that? Pretty simple, straightforward. And to win the battle, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=47.36s)]
*  we obviously do need to talk about these programs as working class programs, because you've heard [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=52.32s)]
*  Mike Johnson casually refer to people as, we don't want able-bodied young men sitting in basements on [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=57.6s)]
*  video games. That's who we're trying to target. That's his quote. I mean, if he says it directly, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=64.32s)]
*  I don't know what human beings out there really desperately want to be unemployed and be on Medicaid. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=69.28s)]
*  That's their ambition in life. I think people want to work and they are working. They're trying to [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=74.32s)]
*  get jobs. It's often not in their control that an employer fires them or limits their hours, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=78.0s)]
*  cuts their wages. And to fight for working class people is to understand that, that they are trying [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=83.52s)]
*  their best to succeed and they're up against these barriers and need healthcare to rely on Medicaid [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=88.8s)]
*  to just get by. And it is up to Democrats to make the case, not just to protect Medicaid, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=94.16s)]
*  but to own it, to say that this vision, this program exists because we are authors of it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=100.72s)]
*  We care so deeply about it. We are going to go and educate the American public about its importance [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=107.04s)]
*  and its value. Ashley, this is a bill that the Republicans are struggling to get done. I mean, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=111.68s)]
*  Jake Sherman is a believer that it will get done and it will end up going to the Senate where it's [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=118.56s)]
*  going to get changed. But the struggle that the Republicans continue to have within their own [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=122.56s)]
*  conference, when they are in control of the House, when they're in control of the Senate, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=128.4s)]
*  when Donald Trump is a president, this is the second time around that we've watched them [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=132.08s)]
*  struggle to get on the same page. How is that possible when Donald Trump is supposed to be [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=137.60000000000002s)]
*  the biggest cudgel in the party? Why is he not able to get legislation passed? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=144.32000000000002s)]
*  So I will say Jake Sherman knows far more than I do, but from what reporting I've done, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=151.84s)]
*  I also share his belief that ultimately, maybe not quite in the exact form they initially [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=156.24s)]
*  intended, this does get passed. But look, he has incredibly narrow majorities in the House, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=161.68s)]
*  in the Senate, and the House conference contains multitudes, right? You have the hard right guys, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=169.76000000000002s)]
*  who in many ways, it should be and frankly is an easier task for Donald Trump than it has been for [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=175.84s)]
*  some past presidents because they used to traditionally, back when I covered Congress, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=182.0s)]
*  they were the rabble rousers, they were the pain and then Speaker Boehner's side, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=186.08s)]
*  they wouldn't agree to anything. A lot of these people are Trump guys. So a lot of those very firm [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=191.12s)]
*  convictions they had about not growing the debt or the deficit or out of control spending, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=198.72s)]
*  some of them still have them and that's what you're seeing now in these final kind of nitpicky [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=204.32s)]
*  points. But they are willing to put a lot of those beliefs aside to do what Donald Trump wants them [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=209.76s)]
*  to do. And then of course, there's the moderates who have a totally different perspective, who [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=216.4s)]
*  represent entirely different constituencies, who are much more concerned with things like [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=221.04s)]
*  the salt cap. But the House has always been, especially House Republicans, like herding cats, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=226.08s)]
*  even when you're someone like Donald Trump, who not to mix a cudgel with the cat metaphor, but [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=231.52s)]
*  who does have that cudgel. David, I wonder how much this politically benefits the Republican Party, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=236.96s)]
*  because you have the conservatives who are arguing that they don't want to add to the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=243.84s)]
*  deficit. The bill that as it currently stands, according to multiple different groups analyzing [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=247.92000000000002s)]
*  it, will add anywhere between two trillion to four trillion to the deficit, which is quite a bit of [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=252.72s)]
*  money. And there's a question about how that's affecting the markets, which we're watching right [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=258.48s)]
*  now. At the same time, one of the ways to not pass a bill that doesn't add so much to the deficit is [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=262.0s)]
*  not just cutting Medicaid, which Josh Hawley has argued is a bad idea for Republicans because they [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=272.08s)]
*  won off the working class, but maybe to raise taxes for the very wealthy instead of lowering them, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=277.12s)]
*  raise taxes for corporations. Donald Trump has already imposed on working Americans the largest [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=283.76s)]
*  working class tax increase in American history. That's what tariffs are. They're a tax that falls [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=290.88s)]
*  on working people. That young man whom Speaker Johnson fantasized about on his couch playing [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=295.03999999999996s)]
*  video games, the couch is tariffed. The video games are tariffed. Does he pause for a soda? The [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=300.4s)]
*  aluminum in the soda is tariffed. Maybe he has a beer. The bottle cap and the bottle are tariffed. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=305.03999999999996s)]
*  Does he have perhaps a snack? The bread made of Canadian wheat, tariffed. With all of the hullabaloo, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=309.2s)]
*  certainly the three card Monte game of the tariffs, we've lost sight. The United States [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=316.96s)]
*  already now is a higher tariff country than it has been at any time since the immediate aftermath [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=321.44s)]
*  of World War II. Those tariffs are now at a level where they are collecting revenue, which is coming [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=326.24s)]
*  overwhelmingly from the people who can afford the least. It's not just spending cuts for the young [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=333.68s)]
*  man on the couch, but massive tax increases on that young man too to finance the high-end tax [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=339.04s)]
*  relief. If Donald Trump raises taxes on the rich, well, you know what? I don't think we should [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=344.96000000000004s)]
*  speculate about this until we've seen the bill notarized. Yeah. We are waiting for the final [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=349.12s)]
*  version of the bill. All right. So we're watching the markets, as I mentioned a moment ago, when [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=355.52s)]
*  the Dow is down nearly 2%, down 800 points almost. Senior business correspondent for NBC News, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=359.59999999999997s)]
*  Christine Romans, has very kindly rushed over to the set for us. So, Christine, explain what we're [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=365.52s)]
*  watching. There's a couple of different things happening here, but there was a treasury bond [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=370.96s)]
*  auction earlier today that was a little disappointing, and that sounds very wonky, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=374.08s)]
*  but it's really important because you've got this tax and spending discussion underway. You've got a [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=377.44s)]
*  Moody's downgrade that just happened because of concerns about debt and deficits, and then you have [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=383.12s)]
*  demand for American treasuries was a little disappointing. So you have people selling [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=388.08s)]
*  treasuries. That means the yields are going up and that's putting pressure on the stock market. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=393.12s)]
*  Basically, it means we're on the wrong footing in terms of our fiscal direction, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=397.76s)]
*  and the markets are paying attention to that. I paid attention when Ron Insana was trying to [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=402.48s)]
*  school me on economics the other day when we were at the New York Stock Exchange after [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=407.12s)]
*  Donald Trump's Liberation Day and the stock market just completely tanked for about a week. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=411.84s)]
*  He said it's bad news when the Russell 2000 is down because that's usually pretty stable. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=416.32s)]
*  It's small businesses. Last I checked, this was a couple hours ago, it was down [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=420.88s)]
*  almost 2%. I was with you when we had that conversation on the floor of the stock exchange. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=426.15999999999997s)]
*  Is it still down? Is it still a problem? Yeah, we watched that one. It doesn't have to do with [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=430.79999999999995s)]
*  what Kevin O'Leary was saying, which is that this budget deal has in it a provision, and he got into [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=434.32s)]
*  the weeds, but one that would make it harder for small businesses to operate. Look, this budget deal [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=439.52s)]
*  is full of a lot of stuff and it's going to change a lot. It's going to touch everybody. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=446.4s)]
*  It will touch everybody. There's that, but when you look at what's happening in the bond market, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=450.96s)]
*  the bond market is sending us a signal that all of this is unsustainable, that America's financial [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=454.79999999999995s)]
*  house is not in order. There's a couple other things happening too. UnitedHealthcare is in the [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=461.35999999999996s)]
*  Dow. That's only 30 stocks, and that had a downgrade today, and it's got all kinds of [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=465.52s)]
*  headwinds and negative headlines for UnitedHealthcare. Target had a disappointing [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=470.0s)]
*  outlook there for Target. It says it's going to do everything it can without raising prices [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=476.24s)]
*  because of tariffs, but that might not be the case. There's a lot of different things happening, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=480.64s)]
*  but I'm very, very focused here on the bond market again and what that is telling us. You have [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=485.12s)]
*  30-year interest rates back above 5%. That hasn't happened since the fall of 2023, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=490.15999999999997s)]
*  so it's telling you there's a moment here in America's fiscal path. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=495.52s)]
*  Speaking of moments, this would seem to be the moment for a progressive, like you were Democrats, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=499.28s)]
*  period, to come out here and say, you trusted Donald Trump on the economy. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=504.96s)]
*  Why did you trust him? Look what's happening. Fundamentally, to zoom out, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=510.64s)]
*  Donald Trump is proposing solutions to problems that are not actually real. There are no problems [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=515.84s)]
*  that he's trying to actually solve for that working class people need. The problems of [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=522.08s)]
*  working class are that housing is more unaffordable for them than ever, buying a car, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=526.5600000000001s)]
*  being able to pay for college education, child care, and health care premiums aren't going [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=533.76s)]
*  through the roof. Nothing that he's talking about refers or addresses those. He is talking [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=539.76s)]
*  about corporate tax reductions. He's talking about, if you look at the distributional impact [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=546.48s)]
*  of his tax plan, people making over $4.3 million, that's the top 0.1%. They get about $400,000 [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=551.12s)]
*  of additional money out of this. Meanwhile, if you're $51,000 or under, you're losing money [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=559.04s)]
*  as a result of this bill, losing money. That's your working class attack, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=564.8s)]
*  and that's the message we've got to get out to working class people. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwBMFzVN210&t=570.4799999999999s)]
