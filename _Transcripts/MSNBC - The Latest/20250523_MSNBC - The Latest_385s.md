# Trump's budget bill includes cuts to food assistance that could strain food banks
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y)
*  Well, as the Senate considers the budget bill, a new map from USA Today shows it could severely [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=0.0s)]
*  impact the poorest Americans. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=6.76s)]
*  If that mega bill would pass, each highlighted state would have to pay at least $98 more [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=9.4s)]
*  a year for each person on food assistance to make up for the $267 billion that was slashed [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  from the program. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=21.96s)]
*  Food banks across the country are said to be terrified, saying it would create an unsolvable [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=23.56s)]
*  crisis as need skyrockets. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=28.159999999999997s)]
*  In Atlanta, the Community Food Bank says demand has jumped 60% in just the past three years. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  That's where we find my next guest, Kyle Wade, president and CEO of the Atlanta Community [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=37.839999999999996s)]
*  Food Bank, which serves more than 800,000 people across 29 counties in North Georgia. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  Kyle, first of all, thanks for being with us. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=48.64s)]
*  What are you seeing right now in terms of food need? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=51.76s)]
*  Well, thanks for having me. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=56.32s)]
*  And as you just said, demand for food assistance is as high as we've seen it in metro Atlanta. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=58.8s)]
*  We know that the same is true for food banks all across the country. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=65.2s)]
*  Lines are just getting longer and longer at food pantries. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=69.36s)]
*  And as you mentioned, we're serving 60% more people today than we did just a few years [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=72.68s)]
*  ago. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=77.32s)]
*  So demand is really high. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=78.32s)]
*  The last thing we need right now is to have a significant cut in programs that get resources [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=80.28s)]
*  to economically vulnerable families. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=86.8s)]
*  That would put an extraordinary amount of additional pressure on food banks and other [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=89.76s)]
*  social programs that are serving those families. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=95.04s)]
*  Can you give us some specifics, for example? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=98.44s)]
*  How would those cuts to snap? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=100.68s)]
*  Again, they now have to go to the Senate. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=102.68s)]
*  But how could it impact your ability to serve? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=105.0s)]
*  What would you do? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=108.52s)]
*  Well, in terms of the scale of what's being proposed, the net effect of the cuts that [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=112.0s)]
*  were included in the House bill would be the same as if we eliminated the entire food bank [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=117.88s)]
*  network in the country. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=124.28s)]
*  That's the scope of what would be cut from assistance to families. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=126.84s)]
*  We'd essentially eliminate all of the food bank activity that exists across the country. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=131.72s)]
*  Ken, I just want to make sure I understand you, because that's a shocking statement. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=137.48s)]
*  Are you essentially saying if this goes through, every single food bank in America would have [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=142.32s)]
*  to double the amount of food, double the amount of people they serve potentially just to meet [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=147.72s)]
*  the need to keep people from going hungry? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=155.08s)]
*  Yes, there are different estimates for what the bill would actually eliminate, but at [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=157.4s)]
*  least one estimate would suggest the equivalent of close to 10 billion meals a year in the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=164.76s)]
*  amount of food that's provided to families. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=173.48s)]
*  It's $30 billion worth of food a year that's being proposed to be cut from the SNAP program. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=175.95999999999998s)]
*  That's more than what food banks collectively distribute every single year. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=183.88s)]
*  We don't know if all of that demand would ultimately come to us, but we're talking about [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=189.48s)]
*  doubling or more our output to provide that same amount of food. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=194.12s)]
*  There are a number of people who, in arguing for this, believe that there's tons of waste, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=199.23999999999998s)]
*  fraud and abuse. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=205.88s)]
*  They believe that there are people who could and should be working who are not. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=207.32s)]
*  They give you a lot of reasons for why they think that these cuts are okay. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=212.2s)]
*  You deal with this on a day-to-day basis. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=218.51999999999998s)]
*  Is that your experience? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=220.84s)]
*  Well, it's certainly not our experience. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=224.28s)]
*  The vast majority of people who receive support from food banks are families who are working. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=226.44s)]
*  A lot of the increase in demand I referenced are among families who actually make too much [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=235.16s)]
*  money to even qualify for SNAP. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=240.51999999999998s)]
*  The folks who are on SNAP predominantly include families, households with children, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=243.32s)]
*  senior households, disabled households. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=250.28s)]
*  So the folks who can work are working in our experience. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=253.95999999999998s)]
*  If we were to remove a lot of those folks from the program through a variety of different [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=257.71999999999997s)]
*  proposed mechanisms in the bill, that would just result in more demand coming to food banks, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=263.56s)]
*  a level of demand that is beyond what we really have the capacity to provide. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=271.24s)]
*  We only have a short time left, but I know this comes after the Trump administration cut [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=276.68s)]
*  Department of Agriculture pandemic funding. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=281.0s)]
*  Big picture. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=283.96000000000004s)]
*  How tough is your job right now? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=285.08000000000004s)]
*  Well, look, there's a lot of pressure on food banks. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=289.40000000000003s)]
*  There's no question. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=291.24s)]
*  We're seeing extraordinary levels of demand. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=292.44s)]
*  We're seeing a contraction of resources. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=294.36s)]
*  We need support from the community. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=297.32000000000005s)]
*  We need support from the government at both the federal, state and local levels to help us meet [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=298.92s)]
*  that demand. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=305.8s)]
*  We know that every administration that comes in wants to do new things and follow its own agenda. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=307.24s)]
*  We're hopeful that we can work with the administration to develop solutions that [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=314.68s)]
*  are aligned with their priorities, but also ensure that all families have the resources [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=321.56s)]
*  they need to thrive in life. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=326.12s)]
*  And we're looking forward to dialogue with the administration on how we can make that happen. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=328.52s)]
*  But right now, we need help from the community to ensure that all of our neighbors [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=334.12s)]
*  have the resources they need, especially as we go into the summer. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=341.08s)]
*  Kids are out of school. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=345.0s)]
*  They have fewer resources during those summer months to meet their basic needs. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=346.6s)]
*  And now is not the time to be pulling resources away from families and food banks. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=352.44s)]
*  Kyle Wade, thank you for the work you do and thank you for coming on the program. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=358.44s)]
*  Kyle Wade, thank you for the work you do and thank you for coming on the program. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQhh5ctJ4Y&t=361.8s)]
