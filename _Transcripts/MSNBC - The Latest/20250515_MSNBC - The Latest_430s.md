# ‘Open season for corruption’: FBI shuts down public corruption unit that investigated Trump
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk)
*  Donald Trump's weaponization of the Justice Department continues in a big way. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=0.0s)]
*  NBC News is reporting that the FBI's Washington field office is folding its federal public [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=4.24s)]
*  corruption squad. That's according to three people familiar with the matter. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=10.0s)]
*  It happens to be the very same unit that worked on Jack Smith's special counsel investigation [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=13.76s)]
*  into Donald Trump. The field office has three units that work on public corruption issues, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  but this one, known internally as CR-15, was deeply involved in the bureau's Arctic Frost [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=23.44s)]
*  investigation, which was the precursor to the Jack Smith probe into efforts to overturn the 2020 [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=29.28s)]
*  election results by Donald Trump and his allies. That investigation resulted in one of the two [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=35.28s)]
*  federal criminal cases against Donald Trump, both of which were dropped after he won the election [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=41.2s)]
*  in November. Earlier this year, the Justice Department slashed its public integrity section, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=46.96s)]
*  which had also worked on public corruption cases. Members of the unit had also resigned after [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  refusing to sign off on dropping the federal corruption case against New York City Mayor [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=57.6s)]
*  Eric Adams. Here's how one former Justice Department official puts it, quote, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=62.4s)]
*  This is yet another sign that it's open season for political corruption. The administration [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=67.12s)]
*  gutted the public integrity section, neutered the U.S. Attorney's office in D.C., and is now [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  shuttering the FBI's preeminent federal public corruption squad. This isn't what voters had in [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=78.0s)]
*  mind when they heard drain the swamp. We're back with Andrea and Melissa. Melissa, this was [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=83.12s)]
*  telegraphed, but to see it put in motion and dismantled is still staggeringly shocking. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=89.52000000000001s)]
*  You're shocked? I'm not shocked by this. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=96.72s)]
*  I mean, it's amazing that the government would say we're not going to do this anymore. It's sort of [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=98.16000000000001s)]
*  a basic government function. And for Trump to corrupt and grift, but say he's still against [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=103.04s)]
*  corruption is actually more Trumpy than to corrupt and grift and actually get rid of [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=110.32s)]
*  the enforcement mechanism for catching other people in acts of corruption. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  I'm not at all surprised by this. They said they were going to do this. They've been very clear [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=119.91999999999999s)]
*  in telegraphing what they are going to do. This isn't just about neutering the FBI's public [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=123.91999999999999s)]
*  corruption unit. It's about neutering the DOJ as an enforcement mechanism to enforce the laws of [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  the United States that this administration doesn't care about or doesn't agree with. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=136.8s)]
*  We've seen the DOJ's priority shift on a myriad of different issues, whether it's voting rights, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=141.36s)]
*  DEI. This is just one in the same. And I will just note, because I love to point out how the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=146.72s)]
*  Supreme Court has essentially midwifed what we have seen here. The Supreme Court has for years [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=151.68s)]
*  whittled down the scope of federal statutes that allow entities like the public corruption unit [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=157.04000000000002s)]
*  to bring cases. So last year there was a case called Snyder v. U.S. that said essentially that [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=164.0s)]
*  it was okay to tip your public official as long as it wasn't a bribe. It was a tip, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=169.12s)]
*  but not a bribe. Tips are okay, bribes are not. And Justice Jackson in a dissent wrote, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=174.48s)]
*  this is a decision that only this court could love. And she's right. And so, yes, we can blame [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=179.92s)]
*  the FBI, we can blame the administration, but we should also offer a healthy dose of blame to the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=186.72s)]
*  court that has essentially paved the way for an administration that wants to griff, that wants to [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=192.48s)]
*  be corrupt. At some point it stops being, though, about the courts and about the Trump administration, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  about us as a country. Historically, the politics of corruption have been abysmal for any Democrat [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  or Republican. I mean, it wasn't a partisan issue. It was politically unpopular to be corrupt, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=209.51999999999998s)]
*  to take money, bribes or tips, whatever you want to call them. Do you think that we're at sort of a [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=215.12s)]
*  post-rule of law moment in this country? One thousand percent. In terms of what the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=221.11999999999998s)]
*  public wants? Yeah. So, no, no, in terms of where the White House is, including the Department of [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=227.28s)]
*  Justice. I'm going to go back to Enron. Enron, a huge fortune-telling company implodes. It's under [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=234.23999999999998s)]
*  the Bush administration. And there was no question I worked on the case. There was no question that [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=242.32s)]
*  was going to be investigated and going to be prosecuted. And there was a third rail [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=248.96s)]
*  was that there would be any, any political interference in that case. And it didn't happen. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=254.0s)]
*  I'm raising that as an example because it was a Republican administration. And that was an [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=260.96000000000004s)]
*  obvious norm. And the same thing happens under Democratic administrations. This is really a [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=265.2s)]
*  post-rule of law country. You have Pam Bondi openly saying things that are not true, i.e. lying. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=271.68s)]
*  You have her saying, and it's a friend of mine said, it's a perfect time to be a corrupt public [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=280.8s)]
*  official or a white collar criminal. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, gone. Farah, the Foreign [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=286.0s)]
*  Agent Registration Act, gone. Cloptocracy Unit, gone. Election Deferrence Unit, gone. Cryptocurrency [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=293.2s)]
*  dismantled. Public corruption at DOJ and at the FBI whittled down. In order to do a public [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=299.28s)]
*  corruption case, prosecutors don't just invent them. You know what you need? Agents. And so the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=306.32s)]
*  squad that the reporting is about is that is an integral part of being able to bring these cases. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=312.64s)]
*  Who in their right mind sits there and goes in the voting booth and says, you know what, I want to [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=319.03999999999996s)]
*  vote for a public official to be able to commit crime. Exactly. I mean, that is, this is like the [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=324.48s)]
*  George Santos. I mean, that is just not something that election people want, but it is what is [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=333.28000000000003s)]
*  happening. And you have no recourse. It's amazing. And I think about this all the time. What is our [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=343.04s)]
*  job in this period between what has been ushered in by the results of the November election and [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=348.72s)]
*  what people actually want? Because people won't get to weigh in again until the midterms. But this [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=354.56s)]
*  is Trump just stripped down naked to his grifting nudity and saying, you know, this is what we're [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=359.28000000000003s)]
*  going to do now. And we'll see. Can't you weigh in on it in a year and a half? That's why the [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=367.6s)]
*  plane is such a great symbol because it's something so concrete and so clear. It's like there's a [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=373.03999999999996s)]
*  single stop with a traditional American ally working on any traditional national interests. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=380.64s)]
*  The trip is about people that his kids have already announced doing business with ahead of the trip. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=385.84s)]
*  It's about personal aggrandizement and using the public role for personal aggrandizement. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=391.67999999999995s)]
*  But it's all out in the public. So there are no investigative stories into Trump Tower, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=396.88s)]
*  Moscow ambitions. His sons are out there announcing the pool in the sky, the golf course, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=402.56s)]
*  the crypto coin deal. It's all out there. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5vq3_6HQk&t=407.12s)]
