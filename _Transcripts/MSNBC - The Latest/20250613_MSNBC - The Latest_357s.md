# 'Never seen anything like this': Robinson says Padilla incident is 'not a good look' for admin
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc)
*  Joining me now, MSNBC legal analyst and former U.S. attorney Joyce Vance and MSNBC political [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=0.0s)]
*  analyst and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Eugene Robinson. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=5.24s)]
*  Joyce, I'll start with you. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=8.08s)]
*  The ruling on Trump's use of the National Guard in California, where do you think it [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=9.66s)]
*  goes from here and what does it tell us about writing precedent in real time? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=13.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=18.04s)]
*  So it's an amazing opinion written by Justice Breyer. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=19.88s)]
*  I know people were disappointed early on when he took two days to set a hearing rather than [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=22.8s)]
*  immediately issuing an injunction. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=27.44s)]
*  But he put those two days to good use. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=30.0s)]
*  This opinion is sort of a masterclass in how judges use case law and the facts of a case [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=32.28s)]
*  to write an opinion explaining what the result should be. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=38.64s)]
*  And that's good news on appeal because this decision that he has rendered, which essentially [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=42.84s)]
*  says there was no indication that there was a rebellion in progress at the point where [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=47.56s)]
*  Donald Trump federalized the Guard, it is, I think, where the courts will tend to lean. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=54.54s)]
*  We've of course got this three-day administrative pause invoked by the Ninth Circuit Court of [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=61.46s)]
*  Appeals. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=65.86s)]
*  That's pretty routine in a case like this, but also the timing is complicated because [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=66.86s)]
*  that means that Trump retains control of the Guard during that critical Saturday period [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=72.06s)]
*  where the No Kings march is taking place. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=77.42s)]
*  Yeah, so there's still more to watch unfold in the courts there. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=79.9s)]
*  But Eugene, the president wasting no time hailing the court for its decision, posting [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=83.34s)]
*  this on Truth Social. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=87.42s)]
*  He wrote, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=88.7s)]
*  The appeals court ruled last night that I can use the National Guard to keep our cities, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=89.7s)]
*  in this case Los Angeles, safe. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=92.9s)]
*  If I didn't send the military into L.A., that city would be burning to the ground, he says. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=94.74000000000001s)]
*  We saved L.A. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=98.5s)]
*  Thank you for the decision. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=99.5s)]
*  So does this only bolster the White House view that they are winning the politics of [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=101.18s)]
*  this moment here? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=105.06s)]
*  Well, they clearly think they're winning the politics. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=106.54s)]
*  I'm not sure that they are. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=110.86s)]
*  To wrestle a U.S. senator to the ground and put him in handcuffs is not a good look for [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=113.02s)]
*  any administration, and I don't think that's a political winner for any administration, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=119.06s)]
*  especially this. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=124.9s)]
*  That was an outrageous incident. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=125.9s)]
*  I've never seen anything like it, and it says a lot about this administration. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=127.9s)]
*  On the legal front, I'm glad we have Joyce here, because I, Joyce, I do remember an [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=134.34s)]
*  instance in which a president federalized the National Guard over the wishes of a governor [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=140.58s)]
*  who's down in Alabama, when President Kennedy did that, to integrate the University of Alabama [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=147.3s)]
*  and get George Wallace to stop standing in the schoolhouse door. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=156.5s)]
*  Is that not a precedent that President Trump can point back at, or is this situation that different? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=160.14s)]
*  Well, he can certainly try to, right? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=169.89999999999998s)]
*  It's 1965 in Alabama. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=171.73999999999998s)]
*  One of the great civil rights judges, Frank Johnson, has ordered that the Guard should [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=174.22s)]
*  protect marchers marching from Selma on to Montgomery and onward as they're trying to [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=179.5s)]
*  enforce the right to vote for black citizens in Alabama. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=186.46s)]
*  And the National Guard doesn't respond. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=190.62s)]
*  The governor of Alabama, who was a law school classmate of Judge Johnson's, just simply [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=192.98000000000002s)]
*  refuses to engage. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=197.54000000000002s)]
*  And so President Johnson invokes federalization, this Title X sort of federalization of the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=199.58s)]
*  National Guard, and orders them to protect marchers. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=205.74s)]
*  Now look, I think you're correct, Eugene, that in some sense that's a precedent that [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=209.74s)]
*  Trump could rely on. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=214.46s)]
*  I don't think he wants to, both because of the context in that case, and also because [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=216.06s)]
*  of the fact that that was an incident where the Guard was being used to protect citizens. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=221.46s)]
*  And this is a very different one. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=227.7s)]
*  Because President Trump is making this rebellion claim, the entire legal context is different. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=230.22s)]
*  I don't think the Alabama precedent is very helpful. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=235.74s)]
*  Yeah, I think that one of the reasons that we look to that, Joyce and Eugene, is because [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=238.54s)]
*  it is one of the few examples that we have in U.S. history of a president calling in [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=243.1s)]
*  the National Guard over the objections of state and local officials, which is exactly [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=247.29999999999998s)]
*  what we see here in California. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=251.62s)]
*  But Gene, I want to pivot back a little bit to that video of Senator Padilla, because [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=253.98s)]
*  you're right that many of us have never seen anything like this. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=257.86s)]
*  And it's also true that those of us who have covered the Capitol, we tend to know who the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=261.3s)]
*  flamethrowers and the drama makers are. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=264.78s)]
*  And Padilla is not one of them. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=267.06s)]
*  So what do you think the impact of that kind of a video is for Democrats in terms of this [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=268.86s)]
*  larger immigration debate and the larger debate over if Trump is overstepping his bounds as [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=273.66s)]
*  president, too? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=278.62s)]
*  Well, look, I think Democrats will be able to point to this just to, as an example of [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=280.1s)]
*  the bullying tactics, the excesses of this administration, the way they always escalate [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=289.26s)]
*  any sort of potential conflict even. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=299.21999999999997s)]
*  There wasn't even a conflict here. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=301.98s)]
*  There was a U.S. Senator coming in to ask a question. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=303.21999999999997s)]
*  And the idea that the cabinet secretary does not recognize and acknowledge a U.S. senator [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=307.5s)]
*  who represents 40 million Americans in the Senate is just outraged. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=317.22s)]
*  Really, I've never seen anything like this. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=324.34000000000003s)]
*  And it's as if they treated him like some random Latino guy who came in to make trouble when [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=326.38s)]
*  that's certainly not what he is and who he is. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8lV13Yevsc&t=334.34000000000003s)]
