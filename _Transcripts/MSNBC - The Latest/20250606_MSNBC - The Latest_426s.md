# ‘Gets worse by the day’: UNICEF spokesperson in Gaza on violence and food scarcity
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc)
*  Today, access to food and other aid in Gaza is even more scarce. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=0.0s)]
*  The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is shutting down all their sites today, telling starving [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=5.14s)]
*  Palestinians to stay away for their safety. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=10.24s)]
*  The U.S.-backed aid group had reopened just yesterday following a series of deadly shootings [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=13.66s)]
*  close to its operations. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=18.22s)]
*  Food in Gaza has been dangerously low. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=20.48s)]
*  The UN warning there's been a surge of the youngest children being diagnosed with acute [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=23.04s)]
*  malnutrition. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=27.44s)]
*  This 11-month-old baby born into war is one of them, struggling to survive at just eight [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=29.44s)]
*  pounds. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=35.6s)]
*  It's all a nightmare on replay. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=36.88s)]
*  One 14-year-old girl tells our team on the ground, quote, we are exhausted. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=38.72s)]
*  We have no food or water. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=43.1s)]
*  Someone needs to stop this war. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=45.04s)]
*  Before all of this, I lived a happy life like any child. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=47.0s)]
*  But now I've lost my childhood. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  I spend my days packing for the next displacement, fetching water for my family, trying to find [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=52.42s)]
*  food. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=58.040000000000006s)]
*  My life has completely changed. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=59.18s)]
*  Joining me now from inside Gaza, UNICEF spokesperson James Elder. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=62.06s)]
*  I know, James, you've returned to Gaza again and again. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=66.3s)]
*  I'm sure the story that was just so heartbreakingly told by that little girl is not unfamiliar [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=69.9s)]
*  to you. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=75.7s)]
*  But what are you seeing this latest time that you've gone there? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=76.7s)]
*  Chris, it gets worse by the day. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=79.78s)]
*  I think the two things that strike me most, one is that level of nutritional decline, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=83.82s)]
*  seeing people on the street doing that universal symbol of hand and mouth, teenage boys tapping [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=88.98s)]
*  on the car window showing me their ribs in tears. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=93.34s)]
*  I've seen severely malnourished children in hospitals, some who won't last a week. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=96.06s)]
*  Many others, of course, will die way before I see them because, of course, malnutrition, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=100.74000000000001s)]
*  mostly what will kill a child there is the sanitation and disease, 10 times more likely [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=106.9s)]
*  than a healthy child. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=112.02000000000001s)]
*  More bombardment. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=113.78s)]
*  Another thing, of course, is just the level of bombardments and attacks that continue. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=114.82000000000001s)]
*  Chris, it's been good in the last couple of weeks. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=119.9s)]
*  There's been some international pressure on the malnutritional situation. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=121.94s)]
*  It seems that we have these blockades. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=125.38s)]
*  It's been three blockades in Gaza, all for about 90 days. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=127.46000000000001s)]
*  And then as the risk of famine becomes very, very real, those blockades are reduced a little [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=130.34s)]
*  bit and then the risk comes back. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=135.9s)]
*  And of course, this is famine, though. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=139.5s)]
*  Feminine is something that has a large number of people being killed. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=141.7s)]
*  Starvation is very different. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=145.34s)]
*  Starvation is about, you know, organs shutting down, cognitive decline. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=146.42s)]
*  That happened. That's happening right now. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=150.86s)]
*  So the other thing with this bombardment, Chris, is just the sheer number of children, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=153.02s)]
*  both the number of children being killed and wounded, but also for the first time now after [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=156.86s)]
*  my five missions, I'm going into hospitals and I'm hearing the screams of children. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=160.78s)]
*  A little eight-year-old girl, double amputation, little boy hit with a tank shell at one of [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=165.1s)]
*  those with shrapnel from a tank shell at an aid distribution site. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=169.66s)]
*  They don't have the medicines. They don't have the painkillers. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=173.9s)]
*  So hospitals and children are just that just these blood curdling cries from girls and boys. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=176.46s)]
*  We're watching on the other side of our screen a little girl who had been playing the day [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=182.46s)]
*  before and now she's paralyzed from the waist down. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=186.62s)]
*  It's so heartbreaking to see and hear these stories. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=189.98s)]
*  And I was remembering a UNICEF headline early on in this war that read Gaza is now a [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=192.62s)]
*  graveyard for children. That was early in the war. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=198.06s)]
*  Are we going to see widespread numbers of children dying because they can't get basics like food and water? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=202.54s)]
*  If we continue to continue to see the level of blockade that we are now and continue to see, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=213.02s)]
*  I guess, that humanitarian organizations, Chris, that have done this since World War II [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=219.18s)]
*  in scores of sites being sidelined as there's a push to try and push a population to the south. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=224.62s)]
*  The foundation that you speak of there is a few sites. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=231.66s)]
*  During the ceasefire there were 400 sites from the United Nations. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=234.94s)]
*  That's what humanitarian aid does. It goes to people where they need it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=238.38s)]
*  You cannot have a few sites for two million people. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=242.22s)]
*  You can't ask grandparents, the sick, the wounded, those with amputations to go to those sites, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=244.38s)]
*  particularly now because we've seen children killed at those sites. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=249.66s)]
*  The little girl you just showed there, Jenna, this was only two days ago. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=252.78s)]
*  She was just starting her day. She's displaced. Her home's destroyed. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=257.26s)]
*  When an airstrike hit, she's paralyzed from the waist down, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=261.5s)]
*  but she hit the floor unable to move, but her eyes were open. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=265.18s)]
*  She watched her friend die in front of her. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=267.65999999999997s)]
*  So yes, right now the world's attention is increasing a little bit [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=269.98s)]
*  on this deprivation and malnutrition. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=273.5s)]
*  But at the same time, Chris, it seems that the mass casualties is something the world no longer dwells on. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=275.58s)]
*  We've got 50,000 girls and boys who've been killed or injured here. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=281.9s)]
*  2,000 children have been killed since the ceasefire ended. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=286.38s)]
*  It's astronomical. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=289.82s)]
*  Somehow it's matched, as I say in hospitals, those children who survive an air attack [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=294.46s)]
*  and have these horrendous wounds, still open wounds as I see, or fourth degree burns, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=299.58s)]
*  are unable to leave. They're denied medical evacuation [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=305.73999999999995s)]
*  and they're denied the painkillers to enter here. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=308.38s)]
*  It's gone way past the pale. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=311.26s)]
*  In our final minute, we only have a minute, can I ask you to talk about something that [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=314.53999999999996s)]
*  you said in a recent video is that this has all become normalized. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=319.09999999999997s)]
*  This is not normal. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=323.98s)]
*  Talk about the desperation that the families feel, the parents, grandparents, as you describe it, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=327.58s)]
*  and that you and the people who work there must feel. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=334.06s)]
*  No, absolutely. This is not a tragedy we couldn't stop. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=338.3s)]
*  It is one that somehow the world is starting to live with. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=340.78s)]
*  The people here, they're in utter survival mode. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=343.58s)]
*  I've never been to a place where you can safely say, with no embellishment whatsoever, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=346.53999999999996s)]
*  that every single child needs mental health support. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=351.17999999999995s)]
*  Every single parent spends a day trying to either survive, to move, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=355.09999999999997s)]
*  or to look for something resembling nutrition. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=358.61999999999995s)]
*  I was at a hospital and there'd been three drone attacks, attacks on hospitals normalized. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=362.46s)]
*  Seeing that little girl with a double amputation at her hips, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=367.02s)]
*  somehow that's normalized, the thousands of children still being bombed whilst they sleep. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=370.21999999999997s)]
*  And this denial of aid to put us to the brink of famine, but knowing people are starving, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=375.18s)]
*  knowing children's bodies are starting to eat their own organs, somehow normalized. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=380.53999999999996s)]
*  It is something that history will record as being one of our dark moments, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=385.18s)]
*  but it's utterly avoidable. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=390.21999999999997s)]
*  It's not too late for those children, their mothers, those families who are still here now. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=391.5s)]
*  It's absolutely not too late for them if those with influence choose to act. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=396.7s)]
*  James Elder, an important message today. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=401.74s)]
*  Thank you and thank you for the work you do. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vqjU-83Nc&t=403.82s)]
