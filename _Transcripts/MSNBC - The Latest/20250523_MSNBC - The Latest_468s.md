# 'Fired for telling the truth': U.S. intelligence being twisted to serve Trump's narratives
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc)
*  It's clearly a signal to tell analysts throughout the intelligence community, you tell the truth, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=0.0s)]
*  you provide objective analysis as you're supposed to be doing, you are running the risk of getting [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=5.96s)]
*  fired. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=10.96s)]
*  That was former CIA Director John Brennan on my colleague Nicole Wallace's show just [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=11.96s)]
*  last week. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=16.28s)]
*  Now, the blockbuster story he was reacting to at the time was the news that Trump Director [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=17.28s)]
*  of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard had fired intelligence officials for putting out [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=21.82s)]
*  an intelligence report that contradicted Trump. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  As former CIA Director Brennan put it last week, they were fired for telling the truth. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=29.46s)]
*  Back in March, Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan immigrants without [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=34.980000000000004s)]
*  due process, of course. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=38.980000000000004s)]
*  And his justification at the time, as I'm sure you remember, for invoking the act was [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=40.38s)]
*  his claim that America was being quote unquote invaded by Venezuela, invaded specifically [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=44.56s)]
*  by members of the Trenda Oroaguang gang at the direction of Venezuelan President Nicolas [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=49.620000000000005s)]
*  Maduro. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=54.6s)]
*  It turns out though that, as you all know, that is not true. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=56.34s)]
*  That's false. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=59.3s)]
*  The intelligence report these analysts were fired over stated that the Venezuelan gang [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=60.3s)]
*  Trenda Oroagua was not controlled by or in cahoots with Venezuela's president. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=64.89999999999999s)]
*  U.S. intelligence agents reported the actual truth, the truth that contradicted Trump, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=69.94s)]
*  and were fired for it. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=75.17999999999999s)]
*  That on its own was, of course, a jaw dropping revelation. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=76.94s)]
*  And that is where the story stood last week when former CIA Director John Brennan commented [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=80.17999999999999s)]
*  on it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=83.94s)]
*  But now the story has gotten even darker. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=84.94s)]
*  This week, the New York Times reported that even before Trump Director of National Intelligence [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=87.06s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard fired the agents who published a truthful report, her chief of staff had [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=90.74000000000001s)]
*  ordered intelligence analysts to rewrite that truthful report so it could not be quote used [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=95.78s)]
*  against Trump. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=100.82000000000001s)]
*  So not only is the Trump administration firing intelligence agencies for telling the truth, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=103.18s)]
*  they are also pressuring them to be at least the very least less than truthful. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=107.86s)]
*  Joining me now is former CIA Director John Brennan. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=113.18s)]
*  It's great to see you. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=117.06s)]
*  And I know you've been following this closely. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=118.06s)]
*  And as somebody who grew up and had rose to the top of the intelligence community, I can [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=119.82000000000001s)]
*  only imagine how outraged you feel as you see all of the developments. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=123.66s)]
*  But I just have to ask you about this latest one. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=128.14000000000001s)]
*  I mean, what do you make of this reporting that the chief of staff for the director of [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=129.66s)]
*  national intelligence was pressuring intelligence analysts who are not political at all. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=133.26s)]
*  They're just doing their job. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=136.98000000000002s)]
*  They're providing the analysis, pressuring them to rewrite their findings to be more [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=138.3s)]
*  in line with what Trump wanted. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=141.98s)]
*  Well, Janice, worrisome on so many levels. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=143.45999999999998s)]
*  First of all, the integrity and objectivity of the intelligence community's analysis is [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=147.73999999999998s)]
*  a solemn obligation of all analysts to make sure that there's going to be no politicization [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=153.29999999999998s)]
*  of that analysis and that intelligence. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=158.98s)]
*  And it's quite clear from the reporting that has come out that the direction that was coming [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=161.73999999999998s)]
*  from Tulsi Gavre's chief of staff, Joe Kent, tried to manipulate the analysis so that it [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=165.79999999999998s)]
*  would in fact conform with what the Trump administration has done on Venezuela. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=171.42s)]
*  And it's because these analysts resisted that interference, is the reason why they were [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=177.1s)]
*  fired. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=181.94s)]
*  But also this individual, Joe Kent, has been nominated to be the director of the National [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=182.94s)]
*  Counterterrorism Center. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=188.38s)]
*  I was the first director of the National Counterterrorism Center. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=189.89999999999998s)]
*  And it's critically important that the leader of that center really make sure that all analysis [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=192.95999999999998s)]
*  that comes out of it is going to adhere to those requirements of objectivity and integrity. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=199.26s)]
*  And this individual clearly is a partisan individual who wanted to reshape the analysis [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=207.66s)]
*  again so that it wouldn't be used to undercut either Gabbard or Donald Trump. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=214.34s)]
*  And again, it's just so contrary to everything that intelligence analysts throughout their [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=219.85999999999999s)]
*  careers, throughout their training have been taught. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=224.78s)]
*  At any level, puts them all in an incredibly untenable position. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=228.78s)]
*  I wanted to ask you two about some news that just broke a few hours ago. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=233.78s)]
*  And we've seen reporting about this for the last couple of weeks. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=237.57999999999998s)]
*  NBC News is reporting that at least half of the National Security Council has been fired [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=240.14s)]
*  or put on leave. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=245.54s)]
*  And a lot of the explanation you hear from people is, well, Trump doesn't rely on a policy [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=247.22s)]
*  team, so he doesn't need a policy process. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=252.22s)]
*  I always say, but that's the whole process of having cabinet agencies and cabinet members [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=254.66s)]
*  debate and suss things out and consider things. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=260.74s)]
*  It's also the implementation mechanism. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=263.74s)]
*  But help us understand, you've sat on the NSC, just how big of a deal, bringing it down [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=266.1s)]
*  from 350, 400 to whatever size it is now and firing 100 people on a Friday afternoon. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=271.8s)]
*  Well, Jen, I think the aim and the purpose is very similar to what they're trying to [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=277.26s)]
*  do with the intelligence analysis. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=281.62s)]
*  They don't want to have anything, again, that's going to contradict Donald Trump. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=283.78s)]
*  And as you well know, the National Security Council staff is the staff responsible for [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=288.38s)]
*  debating the various policy issues and exploring options, the pros and cons, to make sure that [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=293.82s)]
*  there is going to be an interagency process and discussion that is going to be able to [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=300.61999999999995s)]
*  surface the most advisable path that U.S. policy should go down. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=304.9s)]
*  But if Donald Trump decides these policies irrespective and without any input, I can [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=309.42s)]
*  see why they wanted to remove individuals within that National Security Council staff, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=314.94s)]
*  because that is the place where you're going to have options discussed. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=320.1s)]
*  This is where you may, in fact, raise issues that's going to, again, be contrary to what [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=323.74s)]
*  Donald Trump's brothers and decisions are. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=328.82s)]
*  So again, I think it just demonstrates that they don't want any independence of thought [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=331.90000000000003s)]
*  within the national security community. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=336.3s)]
*  They want to make the decisions top down. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=338.62s)]
*  And it's clear that after Donald Trump makes these decisions, they just want to have supporting [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=341.3s)]
*  documentation to, again, undergird his decisions, again, irrespective of the analytic strength [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=346.18s)]
*  of any of those decisions. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=354.3s)]
*  As you know incredibly well, because you've worked with all of them, I mean, there are [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=357.53999999999996s)]
*  people in the NSC working on issues that may not be front and center for the president [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=360.29999999999995s)]
*  at any given period of time because they're working in different bureaus, working on different [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=364.5s)]
*  things around the world. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=368.9s)]
*  It's being reported that staffers were only given a half an hour's notice between when [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=370.14s)]
*  they were told they were being put on leave and when they had to exit the building. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=374.94s)]
*  And again, the points of contact when it's working through the interagency. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=379.09999999999997s)]
*  Can you help us understand why this could the sudden the sudden nature of this seems [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=383.62s)]
*  concerning and destructive on its own? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=387.53999999999996s)]
*  But what do you think? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=389.5s)]
*  I think it's very concerning. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=391.38s)]
*  And Marco Rubio, who is secretary of state and national secret advisor, supposedly had [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=393.1s)]
*  blessed this decision. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=397.58s)]
*  And again, this is a way to constrain whatever type of intelligence as well as discussion [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=399.5s)]
*  needs to take place. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=406.26s)]
*  The NSC staff is supposed to orchestrate that interagency process. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=407.26s)]
*  But I think from all accounts, there's really no interagency process right now. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=411.14s)]
*  It's just these group of folks up at the top who are moving forward with the decisions [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=414.78s)]
*  that Donald Trump is making, again, without the appropriate input. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=419.46000000000004s)]
*  So, again, this is just antithetical to all of those processes and all the administrations [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=422.86s)]
*  before it that relied heavily on the National Security Council staff in order to make sure [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=428.14000000000004s)]
*  that they tee up the options and the pros and cons of those policy courses. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=432.58000000000004s)]
*  John Brennan, thank you for staying up with us. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=439.70000000000005s)]
*  Not up with us, but thank you for being with us on Friday night. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=442.66s)]
*  I really appreciate it. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=445.34000000000003s)]
*  Thanks for joining us. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=446.34000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antxxinKfHc&t=449.42s)]
