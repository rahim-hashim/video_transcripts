# ‘Major gamble' by Netanyahu: Fmr. Deputy Asst. Secy. of State reacts to attack on Iran
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc)
*  Let's get more now from NBC News chief international correspondent Keir Simmons, MSNBC military [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=0.0s)]
*  analyst, Medal of Honor recipient, retired Colonel Jack Jacobs, and former Deputy Assistant [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=5.64s)]
*  Secretary of State Joel Rubin. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=10.88s)]
*  Keir, these attacks appear to be ongoing. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=12.72s)]
*  Bring us up to speed on the very latest from the region and Israel's calculation here. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=14.92s)]
*  Why now? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=18.72s)]
*  Yeah, and all the reports are that they are ongoing. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=19.72s)]
*  And frankly, we know that they are likely ongoing because all of the analysis was that [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=24.32s)]
*  if Israel wanted to take out, if you like, Iran's nuclear capability, it wouldn't be [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=29.88s)]
*  able to do it in just one wave of strikes. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=35.4s)]
*  And I think that's what we're seeing. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=37.08s)]
*  The IDF saying it carried out these strikes on those nuclear sites, but also targeting [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=38.68s)]
*  Iran's military leadership. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=44.6s)]
*  The Revolutionary Guard chief Hossein Salami, for example, and other commanders have been [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  killed. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=50.72s)]
*  Iran saying this morning that six scientists have been killed. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=51.72s)]
*  And state TV reporting that civilians, including children among the dead, though, that cannot [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=55.04s)]
*  be independently verified. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=59.959999999999994s)]
*  Of course, you mentioned President Trump, he urging Iran to make a deal on its nuclear [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=61.239999999999995s)]
*  program with that post on social social warning that even more brutal Israeli attacks would [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=67.32s)]
*  follow if Iran didn't negotiate. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=75.96s)]
*  Now, previously, President Trump had indicated that he didn't think that attacks like this [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=79.52s)]
*  would help the negotiations. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=84.24s)]
*  That seems to have changed with these new posts by him and saying on social media, President [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=86.28s)]
*  Trump, that the next attacks already planned and will be more brutal. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=93.68s)]
*  There's also a fascinating piece of reporting, according to anonymous sources in local media, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=98.84s)]
*  saying that the Mossad spy agency began smuggling missiles into Iran several months ago and [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=107.60000000000001s)]
*  also secretly installed explosive drones deep inside the country to lay the groundwork [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=112.8s)]
*  for this overnight attack. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=118.12s)]
*  And NBC News has not confirmed those reports. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=120.2s)]
*  But when we heard from President Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel overnight, he spoke in [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=123.0s)]
*  English and he was uncompromising. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=130.28s)]
*  And so, Colonel Jacobs, at least three senior enough highly enriched uranium for nine atom [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=133.0s)]
*  bombs, nine. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=140.32s)]
*  In recent months, Iran has taken steps that it has never taken before, steps to weaponize [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=142.35999999999999s)]
*  this enriched uranium. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=148.96s)]
*  And if not stopped, Iran could produce a nuclear weapon in a very short time. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=150.72s)]
*  That is why we have no choice but to act and act now. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=155.64s)]
*  Meanwhile, Iran's president with a message to his nation this morning saying Iran's [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=162.4s)]
*  legitimate and powerful response will make Israel regret its foolish act. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=167.2s)]
*  Anna? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=172.52s)]
*  Kier, thank you. Please stay with us. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  You just took through a lot there. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=175.44s)]
*  So let's break it down further. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=176.68s)]
*  Colonel Jacobs, at least three senior military officials were killed, as well as a couple of [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=178.0s)]
*  nuclear scientists. You have the missile sites, the nuclear facilities damaged, destroyed. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=182.44s)]
*  What's your reaction to the scope of this attack? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=188.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, with respect to the people involved, Israel has eliminated people in leadership [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=192.28s)]
*  positions and scientists before and has replaced them all. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=198.16s)]
*  As a matter of fact, Iran has already named replacements for those who were killed in the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=200.92s)]
*  attacks last night. So people can be replaced. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  The attack on the facilities is something else again. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=211.0s)]
*  They went after the most vulnerable facility at Natanz, which has been attacked before. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=214.76s)]
*  But the facility near Qom, which is deep inside a mountain, is extremely difficult to get to. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=222.72s)]
*  And while not impervious to attack, requires different kinds of weapons and different kinds of [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=231.76s)]
*  tactics than Israel has used to date. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=236.92000000000002s)]
*  So if it wants to eliminate, greatly reduce Iran's capability to enrich uranium to weapons [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=240.44s)]
*  grade, it will have to go after that site. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=249.76s)]
*  It hasn't done that yet. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=253.04s)]
*  It's interesting to note, however, that the initial attacks had to take out Iran's any [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=255.28s)]
*  aircraft capability. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=262.44s)]
*  Otherwise, the Israeli aircraft wouldn't be able to get to their targets. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=264.36s)]
*  So that's why there are still attacks on facilities yet to come. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=270.52000000000004s)]
*  But getting the facility at Qom is going to be extremely difficult. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=275.20000000000005s)]
*  Joel, President Trump had said he didn't want Israel to attack, that it could scuttle those [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=279.56s)]
*  U.S.-Iran nuclear attacks that have gone through at least five rounds at this point. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=285.16s)]
*  Are you surprised Netanyahu went ahead anyway? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=289.76s)]
*  Well, you know, Ana, this truly was the most daring Israeli military strike since the Six Day [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=292.4s)]
*  War, a major gamble by Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=299.28s)]
*  And to your question about President Trump, you know, I think that he probably greenlit this [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=302.88s)]
*  strike. Now, he didn't publicly call for it. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=308.84s)]
*  He didn't directly have American military support for it. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=311.91999999999996s)]
*  But, you know, there wasn't a major commitment to this diplomacy by the United States. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=317.0s)]
*  It was more of a feeling out of the diplomacy. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=323.15999999999997s)]
*  Steve Wyckoff met, talked about term sheets throughout the idea of no enrichment, then [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=325.88s)]
*  pulled it back, was confused on his messaging. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=332.15999999999997s)]
*  And I think this was a test. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=334.67999999999995s)]
*  And clearly, Iran didn't pass the test. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=336.91999999999996s)]
*  And President Trump, he didn't seem to have any qualms with Israel's strike last night. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=339.28s)]
*  No, it does seem like he's jumped on Israel's side early this morning and continuing to [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=344.47999999999996s)]
*  offer some tough talk toward Iran. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=351.28s)]
*  The U.S., though, officially, Colonel, has said Israel acted unilaterally. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=354.28s)]
*  Iran's foreign ministers arguing this attack couldn't have happened without the coordination [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=360.28s)]
*  and approval of the United States. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=364.91999999999996s)]
*  What do you think? Could this have gone down without the U.S. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=366.44s)]
*  getting some kind of approval? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=369.56s)]
*  I think that... [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=372.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=373.0s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead, Colonel. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=373.52000000000004s)]
*  No, it could have occurred without American assistance or approval. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=376.24s)]
*  In the past, we've given intelligence assistance, passing on information, gleaned from [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=381.72s)]
*  satellites and so on. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=388.08000000000004s)]
*  But Israel has the capability and has demonstrated the capability of launching attacks like [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=389.12s)]
*  this on its own. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=394.6s)]
*  To the extent that they need other weapons, Israel has demonstrated that it can [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=396.8s)]
*  manufacture its own. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=403.71999999999997s)]
*  So, yeah, easily done by Israel, by itself, requiring absolutely no approval or [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=405.36s)]
*  assistance from the United States. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=413.24s)]
*  But what do we know about U.S. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=415.48s)]
*  assets in the region and the potential risk to them and the risk that the U.S. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=417.76s)]
*  gets drawn into this? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=423.56s)]
*  Yeah, well, we do have assets in the region. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=427.0s)]
*  We've withdrawn some of them. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=430.84s)]
*  Of course, we have strategic interests in the region. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=432.68s)]
*  And any conflict there makes it extremely difficult for us to maintain the surveillance [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=436.04s)]
*  that we need to maintain, particularly over Houthis and others. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=444.64s)]
*  And so withdrawing forces from the region makes it hard for us to achieve our [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=449.2s)]
*  strategic objectives there. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=455.4s)]
*  So any volatility in the region makes it hard for us to project our power. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=457.35999999999996s)]
*  It's unclear so far how long it's going to take for Israel to achieve what it wants [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=463.0s)]
*  to achieve. It may take a matter of days or even weeks. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=469.0s)]
*  But during that time, it's going to be hard for the United States to project its power [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=473.2s)]
*  in the region, Ana. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=477.28s)]
*  Kier, can you give us a sense of what Iran might have planned in terms of retaliation? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=478.64s)]
*  What have we seen so far? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=484.12s)]
*  How does it compare to what we've seen in the past? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=485.2s)]
*  And what kind of warnings are they giving this morning? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=487.08s)]
*  This doesn't look like the kind of retaliation that we saw previously with Iran just in [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=492.52s)]
*  response to previous Israeli attacks. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=497.96s)]
*  The question is going to be whether Iran simply isn't capable of a response like that yet [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=501.28s)]
*  now. As you know, some of its proxies like Hezbollah are completely crushed, frankly. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=506.84s)]
*  So that is going to be a question and I guess we'll get the answer in the coming days. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=513.72s)]
*  We are hearing that Iran has cancelled the talks that were planned for Sunday with [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=519.52s)]
*  President Trump's envoy, Steve Wicoff. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=525.8000000000001s)]
*  So clearly it is moving to a defensive, if not offensive position rather than moving [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=528.04s)]
*  towards the kinds of negotiations that President Trump has called for. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=536.24s)]
*  Another point I think just worth making, too, though, is that the UN's nuclear [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=539.64s)]
*  observer has said just in the past 24 hours, interestingly, just before these strikes, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=547.1999999999999s)]
*  that Iran was not complying with its obligations around its nuclear program. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=554.3199999999999s)]
*  And so another question is going to be, was Iran reaching for nuclear capability anyway? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=560.3199999999999s)]
*  Or if Israel isn't able to fully kind of demolish, if you like, Iran's nuclear program, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=568.88s)]
*  will this push Tehran towards getting a nuclear bomb? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=575.28s)]
*  Yeah, the International Atomic Energy Agency is saying just this week that Iran had not [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=580.9599999999999s)]
*  complied with the nuclear obligations for the first time in about 20 years. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=586.0799999999999s)]
*  We've seen so much video here from inside Iran and all of the damage that has occurred [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=592.1999999999999s)]
*  because of these Israeli strikes overnight. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=599.4s)]
*  And we do know that those 100 drones were launched toward Israel almost immediately [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=602.04s)]
*  in response. Do we know if there was any damage inside Israel? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=606.68s)]
*  It doesn't look like it. We do hear that over Jordan, Iranian drones were shot down. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=612.68s)]
*  And if that is the case, then that will increase the nervousness in Arab nations in the Gulf, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=619.24s)]
*  where I am, for example, over whether Iran will turn and respond towards those nations [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=626.04s)]
*  that are partners with the United States. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=631.92s)]
*  The Arab world has shifted quite considerably in recent years towards a more diplomatic [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=634.6s)]
*  approach to Iran. It's changed just as the White House has shifted away from a more diplomatic [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=642.8399999999999s)]
*  approach, if you like. So that will be another one of the concerns. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=649.76s)]
*  But we really have no clear idea at this stage about how long this, as you've been saying, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=654.5999999999999s)]
*  how long these strikes by Israel will continue. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=661.8399999999999s)]
*  And Israel is showing video of them taking out some of Iran's defences. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=665.3599999999999s)]
*  So it may be that Iran is, frankly, simply trying to defend in a position of defense [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=668.92s)]
*  right now, rather than being able to take any real offensive action. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOXMD0wmMc&t=675.24s)]
