# 'Repeal and replace is not a plan’: Michael Steele on GOP’s empty promises for health care
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc)
*  I think sometimes when we talk about this budget, we talk about it in silos, as though [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=0.0s)]
*  it's only going to affect people who are on Medicaid, or it's only going to affect people [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=3.36s)]
*  who benefit from some government services. You always look at the economy as this macro question. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  How do you think this bill, as written now, understanding it has to go through the Senate, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=11.6s)]
*  impacts the economy as a whole? Well, you know, people forget that a lot of what people are paying [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=15.6s)]
*  for their monthly budget is their mortgage. It's their credit card. Interest rates are still [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  looking to go up because of the huge amount of debt that they are taking on to finance these tax [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=25.919999999999998s)]
*  cuts. All the health care losses are going to mean more those medical bills that people have [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=31.2s)]
*  to battle on. And of course, if groceries and other key essentials are more expensive, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=36.64s)]
*  we will pay for this in one way or another. At the core of it, though, for a lot of those folks, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  in addition to the things you touch on, are some of the fundamentals. All right? So it's [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=48.32s)]
*  the food I put on the table, but it's the health care I got to pay for because I got a sick [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=55.68s)]
*  grandmama. I got a husband who's not doing well. I've got my own issues, my kids. You've got the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=60.0s)]
*  Washington Post reporting Republicans trying to repeal Obamacare again. And look, for the record, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=66.8s)]
*  everybody knows I was part of that fight. You know what? We'll take you, you know? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  But no, look, I admit the loss then, right? We fought and we lost. The American people [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=77.12s)]
*  said they didn't want it. The Congress was able to do what they wanted to do, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=84.64s)]
*  right? And that was 2010. Since that time, though, you have now congressional Republicans pursuing [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=88.24000000000001s)]
*  changes to the Affordable Care Act. That would mean 10.7 million fewer Americans using its [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=94.08000000000001s)]
*  insurance marketplaces and Medicaid, a huge reduction that some view as a way to accomplish [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=99.36000000000001s)]
*  part of the health care coverage cancellation that failed in 2017. So even between that 2010 period [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=105.44000000000001s)]
*  and 2017, you can make the case repeal Obamacare. But as I said in closed quarters then, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=112.96s)]
*  and continue throughout to say, what are you replacing it with? We still need to have a plan. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=122.0s)]
*  Republicans have never offered a plan, nothing even close to viable as a plan. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=127.91999999999999s)]
*  Repeal and replace is not a plan. It's not a strategy. It doesn't even, I mean, it's good [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=134.56s)]
*  rhetoric and that's about it. So for a lot of Americans, that's when it gets real for them, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=140.16s)]
*  when all of a sudden they've got these doctor bills and these health care expenses that hit them. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=146.4s)]
*  But then pre-existing conditions come back. A lot of this narrative come back for a lot of families. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=154.48s)]
*  How does that feed this unease that people have about what Republicans are doing? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=159.76s)]
*  Well, there's a real tension because on one hand, they're also saying people should have more children. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=166.64s)]
*  People should have more families. But they don't want to pay for the health care. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=172.32s)]
*  If you're going to have no health care, if the cost of student loans and higher education is going [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=175.11999999999998s)]
*  to be jacked up, if it's more costly to get food, how on earth are you supposed to have more and [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=181.2s)]
*  more children to support when housing costs are still so burdensome and nothing has been done to [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=188.0s)]
*  address it? So to me, this is the canary in the coal mine for actually undermining how it would cost [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=195.36s)]
*  for a family to survive. I think it's so important you keep talking about housing and these other costs [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=202.24s)]
*  that people find in their everyday, that affects people in their everyday lives because when folks [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=207.28s)]
*  talk about affordability, that is what they mean. The ability that they can afford to live how they [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=211.36s)]
*  would like to live every day and that is grocery prices. Yes, that is housing, whether it's rent or [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=217.36s)]
*  your mortgage. And I was looking at today, there are retailers who are raising their prices as [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=223.2s)]
*  Donald Trump's tariffs take hold. This is from CNBC. Multiple major retailers said they have [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=228.79999999999998s)]
*  already raised some prices or plan to hike them in the coming weeks to offset the duties. They [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=234.23999999999998s)]
*  include major grocers and consumer goods sellers at Costco, Best Buy, Walmart and Target. I shop at [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=238.88s)]
*  Costco. Okay, I knew the prices was going up because I went into Costco the other day and I said, now [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=244.39999999999998s)]
*  what is going on? I still bought it. But if I'm noticing the numbers, I could imagine folks who [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=250.32s)]
*  are literally living paycheck to paycheck how they're feeling. Well, if you look now, even at [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=256.96s)]
*  Walmart, we're seeing reports of triple digit percentage price increases from rolls of tape [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=262.56s)]
*  to toys and more. And I think we all need to watch, even if Trump does tariffs, takes them away, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=270.16s)]
*  retailers are starting to tell people, we're just going to raise prices no matter what, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=278.8s)]
*  because we can pin the blame on the tariffs, just like we pin the blame on COVID shortages. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=284.72s)]
*  And the result is going to be gigantic price increases, big profits for corporations. But [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=290.88s)]
*  those people living to paycheck to paycheck, they're going to be big in debt because of it. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=297.20000000000005s)]
*  And then those prices become sticky and it becomes harder. That's right. It seems they never come [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=301.28000000000003s)]
*  down. We all still walk down the grocery store wondering how on earth is this cereal $6.59? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=305.36s)]
*  There's 100 cereals, three cereal companies. It's easier and easier for them to push up the prices. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=312.8s)]
*  But that also speaks to, yeah, on the price side, manufacturers and retailers, etc., they can [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=321.2s)]
*  jack their prices. The assumption is that the consumer is going to pay. And at a certain point [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=329.44s)]
*  in any given economy, this is a real thing, consumers decide, you know what, I'm not going [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=336.15999999999997s)]
*  to spend that money because my budget has gotten smaller now. It's tighter because there's less [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=340.88s)]
*  revenue coming in. The cost for the things that I've got to spend for has gone up. So [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=348.15999999999997s)]
*  consumers then make those choices where they impact the market too by their behavior. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=355.20000000000005s)]
*  This is the impact of tariffs. It's not just what the retailers and the supply chain and all that is. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=362.48s)]
*  It's on the other end of that how consumers then say, you know what, we're just not taking [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=368.40000000000003s)]
*  that vacation. We're not going to go spend for this. We're not going to buy that. We're not [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=373.04s)]
*  going to get all these supplies that we would normally get at the beginning of the school year. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=377.6s)]
*  That's the other impact. So you start destabilizing the economy at both ends. That's [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=381.92s)]
*  the concern the Fed has had and that's the line that they're trying to walk on tax, on interest [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=387.52000000000004s)]
*  rates, for example. But those other personal economies are big drivers too. Well, we're [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=394.96000000000004s)]
*  seeing that. There's signs that even upper income consumers, credit card delinquency is going up. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=400.72s)]
*  Auto loan delinquency is going up. FICO scores, those are our credit scores. First time in a while, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=407.76s)]
*  they're going down. So we're already seeing the rubber band stretch for families and who knows, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=413.52s)]
*  this could make for many of them snap. And you know, some people though, they cannot reduce their [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=420.88s)]
*  spending. They need the diapers. They need the milk. They need to put food on the table and they're [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=426.72s)]
*  the ones who are really going to get hit. So you know all the work you spent the last few years [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=432.32s)]
*  doing is they're busy undoing it at the CFPB. They're also busy rolling back regulations from [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=437.12s)]
*  the post financial crisis here. I'm going to read you something from Politico and then you're going [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=442.8s)]
*  to explain it to me in English because it has to do with banking. Trump appointed regulators are [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=446.08s)]
*  nearing completion of a proposal that would relax rules on how much of a capital cushion [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=450.48s)]
*  the nation's largest banks must have to absorb potential losses and remain solvent during periods [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=456.0s)]
*  of economic stress. What does that mean for the average person? Well for those who remember 2008, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=461.52s)]
*  the banks actually got bailed out by the taxpayers and the reason why is because [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=468.56s)]
*  their shareholders had such little skin in the game that when they had big losses in order to [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=475.28s)]
*  protect the system, the government had to step in. So what we are seeing is another effort to roll [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=482.79999999999995s)]
*  back these regulations and I think this is an invitation for more bailouts just so bank [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=490.16s)]
*  executives and their shareholders can get richer. We saw this the last Trump administration did this [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=496.96000000000004s)]
*  and we had three major banks, Silicon Valley Bank, collapse over the course of a few days and guess [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=503.44000000000005s)]
*  what? I had to vote for this too. The government had to step in. I don't think Americans want large [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=510.8s)]
*  banks bailed out at a time when their health care is getting cut, when fundamental services [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=518.64s)]
*  are being destroyed and they're just trying to get by. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCOPFpmQWc&t=525.1999999999999s)]
