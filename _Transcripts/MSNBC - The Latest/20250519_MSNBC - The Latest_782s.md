# Trump’s retreat! Melber on tariffs with billionaire who called for ‘disgusting’ Trump to be jailed
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM)
*  The United States has been absorbing the cost of Trump's ongoing trade war. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=0.0s)]
*  It's been deemed destructive and unwise by economists really across the spectrum. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=3.44s)]
*  Many political issues split by ideology. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=7.84s)]
*  We know that. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  But finance can be a bit different, especially for the people who focus on numbers. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  A lot of business leaders have spoken out against these tariffs, and that's regardless [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=14.620000000000001s)]
*  of their votes in last year's campaign. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=18.96s)]
*  We've seen the leaders of finance and investing have also lived through some of these experiments [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=21.900000000000002s)]
*  before. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=26.2s)]
*  Warren Buffett recently warning against escalating trade wars. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=27.279999999999998s)]
*  And a Wall Street and Goldman Sachs veteran, billionaire investor Leon Cooperman, is someone [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=30.88s)]
*  that often is called upon in financial crises to make sense of things. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=35.96s)]
*  He also, like Buffett, joined that giving pledge, donating back most of his wealth so [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=40.44s)]
*  he knows finance from making a billion but also isn't hoarding it. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=47.14s)]
*  He made that money on his own after growing up working class in Brooklyn and launched [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=52.28s)]
*  one of the top hedge funds. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=57.279999999999994s)]
*  He's deployed his influence not only through money, which he's very blunt about how it [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=58.72s)]
*  works and how to spend it, but also a megaphone type platform, meetings with some of the elite [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=63.12s)]
*  sort of folks in finance and sometimes in politics. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=67.75999999999999s)]
*  And he joined us once for our summit series. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=70.86s)]
*  I started my career in Wall Street with a six-month-old child, a negative net worth, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=75.72s)]
*  no money in the bank, a student loan to repay, which is why I had a negative net worth. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=81.2s)]
*  I made a lot of money and I'm giving it all back to the system. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=85.08s)]
*  There you have it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=87.32s)]
*  A negative net worth is one way to say that you are, well, broker in debt. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=88.75999999999999s)]
*  He's going to join us here momentarily on the beat. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=94.12s)]
*  This is his first interview with us since Trump, of course, has taken office. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=96.48s)]
*  Again, here's what he told us about Trump in 2023. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=99.32s)]
*  Trump is a disgusting human being. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=104.08s)]
*  He belongs in jail, in my opinion. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=105.36s)]
*  Stick in the private sector, get out of government, you do the country a big favor. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=107.2s)]
*  You're too damn divisive. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=110.32s)]
*  I would never vote for him under any circumstances. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=112.0s)]
*  Celebrated billionaire investor Leon Cooperman joins us now. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=115.24s)]
*  Welcome back. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=119.2s)]
*  Nice to be back with you, Harry. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=120.2s)]
*  You know your way around these issues in plain English, which is how I got to know you. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=123.3s)]
*  You speak clearly. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=127.84s)]
*  Are these tariffs working? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=129.76s)]
*  Are they good for the American economy? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=131.56s)]
*  No, I think they're bad for the economy. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=133.56s)]
*  They're bad for the world. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=136.56s)]
*  It creates a tremendous amount of uncertainty. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=137.56s)]
*  It adds to inflation. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=139.56s)]
*  It's going to slow growth, which made the world prosperous as global trade. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=140.68s)]
*  It's a negative for global trade. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=146.28s)]
*  So I have to say I side with those that are negative on tariffs. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=148.84s)]
*  Now the president is a very confusing image. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=153.72s)]
*  I think he's doing the right things in terms of dealing with debt, to heading to a crisis, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=157.2s)]
*  but he's doing it the wrong way. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=161.8s)]
*  And I'm disturbed by a lot of things that I see, but it's a personal view. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=164.8s)]
*  Yeah, and let me play for you some of what he says because, like I mentioned, you've [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=170.68s)]
*  lived this. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=174.04s)]
*  A lot of folks aren't in finance. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=175.04s)]
*  A lot of our viewers are living their lives. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=177.20000000000002s)]
*  Maybe they got retirement savings. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=179.24s)]
*  You've been through this. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=181.44s)]
*  And so we're hearing a lot of claims. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=182.44s)]
*  They're not backing down on everything. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  They've pulled off some of the tariffs, as you know. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=185.56s)]
*  But I want to play some of what Trump and his aides are saying about how this should [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=187.72s)]
*  work. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=190.84s)]
*  President Trump has brought hundreds of countries now from around the world to the negotiating [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=194.44s)]
*  table. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=199.72s)]
*  This is the art of the deal. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=200.72s)]
*  President Trump creates what I would call strategic uncertainty in the negotiations. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=201.92s)]
*  You traveled to India. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=206.0s)]
*  Is that the first deal that's coming through? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=207.0s)]
*  I don't know if it'll be the first deal. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=208.52s)]
*  I think it'll be among the first deals for sure. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=210.28s)]
*  Pretty soon. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=212.48s)]
*  Pretty soon. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=213.48s)]
*  The president, look, we've got negotiations with Japan, with Korea. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=214.48s)]
*  I am confident that the Chinese will want to reach a deal. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=217.16s)]
*  Would you like to see your first trade deal be with Canada? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=221.84s)]
*  I would love that. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=225.76s)]
*  Everyone says, when, when, when are you going to sign deals? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=226.76s)]
*  We don't have to sign deals. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=228.44s)]
*  They have to sign deals with us. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=230.16s)]
*  Are they wrong? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=232.24s)]
*  And is it a bad sign there's been no deals so far? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=233.44s)]
*  Very wrong. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=236.6s)]
*  Very wrong. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=237.6s)]
*  It's unnecessary. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=238.6s)]
*  We don't have to be a bully. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=239.6s)]
*  I think what they're doing in Doge in dealing with the debt is very necessary. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=241.6s)]
*  I think we were heading to a financial crisis in this country. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=246.52s)]
*  The debt was growing astronomically and we had to deal with it. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=249.68s)]
*  And we've had no leadership in the country. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=255.04s)]
*  I said both political parties, the Republicans and the Democrats, are responsible. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=256.52000000000004s)]
*  Nine years ago, Simpson-Bowles Commission came out with a report, the university accepted [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=262.04s)]
*  to deal with Social Security, and nothing was done. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=266.76s)]
*  And the problem today, nine years later, is it's three times greater. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=269.64000000000004s)]
*  And it's very scary. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=273.12s)]
*  Very scary. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=274.12s)]
*  So I think that the Republicans currently, President Trump thinks he can micromanage [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=275.12s)]
*  the economy, and I don't think he can. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=281.32s)]
*  What does he want to take over Canada? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=284.76s)]
*  45 million liberals in the country. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=287.08s)]
*  Is that an exact count, Leon? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=289.4s)]
*  That was a rough number. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=292.4s)]
*  I read somewhere. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=295.12s)]
*  Sure. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=296.12s)]
*  I have one eye these days and I still read a lot. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=297.12s)]
*  Yeah, you mentioned, and I would say for folks watching, you mentioned, so you're sharing [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=300.52s)]
*  it, yeah, you said you've lost sight in one eye, but you read out of the other one and [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=305.76s)]
*  you're up on all the news, that's for sure. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=310.2s)]
*  Yeah, well, I've had a bad run of health and, you know, as I tell kids for 30 years, throughout [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=312.6s)]
*  life, you can have a setback. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=318.6s)]
*  What makes you success is how you handle the setback. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=320.44s)]
*  So I've been diagnosed with Parkinson's. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=323.04s)]
*  I have no tremor. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=324.52000000000004s)]
*  You look at me and everybody says you look terrific. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=325.52000000000004s)]
*  And I said, I'd rather feel terrific than look terrific. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=327.52000000000004s)]
*  I don't feel terrific, but, you know, it is what it is. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=330.0s)]
*  I got to deal with it. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=333.52000000000004s)]
*  And I think that, you know, I'll deal with it successfully. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=335.0s)]
*  I'll push through it. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=340.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=341.0s)]
*  Well, I appreciate you sharing that. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=342.64s)]
*  Some people, you know, people have different styles about it, but it's actually, I think, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=344.64s)]
*  useful to remind everyone when it comes to health and what people are going through. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=349.56s)]
*  And I wish you... [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=353.76s)]
*  My life is an open book. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=354.76s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=355.76s)]
*  Well, I wish you the, I wish you the absolute best with that. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=356.76s)]
*  I've gotten to talk with you here through interviewing you, and I know you'd be a straight [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=358.32s)]
*  shooter, so I wish you the best with that. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=361.28s)]
*  I'm going to put the markets up on the screen because you mentioned about Trump trying to [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=362.76s)]
*  manage the economy. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=367.12s)]
*  This is the Dow Jones down over 7% from inauguration. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=368.44s)]
*  The top 500 companies, S&P, also down just over 7%. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=372.44s)]
*  For those of us who aren't experts in this, who don't trade the way you did for many years, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=378.56s)]
*  how do you make sense of this signal to noise? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=383.48s)]
*  What portion of this do you think is from Trump sort of interceding, almost big government [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=386.12s)]
*  tariffs being a drag on the market? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=390.6s)]
*  What portion is sort of unknowable or other stuff? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=393.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, bear markets tend to last at least a year, and recessions precede bear markets. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=396.56s)]
*  Bear markets discount a recession, is the best way of saying it. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=401.88000000000005s)]
*  So I think that we're in a bear market, and I think that the final bottom could be as [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=406.08000000000004s)]
*  much as 25% below the peak, which would be well below where we are currently. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=410.64000000000004s)]
*  And the best sign that the market is adjusted to the new reality, and there's no signs that's [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=415.68s)]
*  going on right now, is when stocks don't go down on bad news. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=421.52s)]
*  Markets top on good news, and markets bottom on bad news. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=426.24s)]
*  When you get the bad news coming out and the stocks don't go down, that's a sign of a bottom. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=430.59999999999997s)]
*  Now, we had classic signs with top in February. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=435.91999999999996s)]
*  Everybody was bullish in February, and people are still bullish. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=438.03999999999996s)]
*  And they're very complacent. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=442.71999999999997s)]
*  They're willing to stick with the market. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=444.03999999999996s)]
*  They're saying that the best way to build wealth, which I agree with, is through stocks. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=446.44s)]
*  But you've got to be attuned. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=451.56s)]
*  You've got to avoid the big shrinkage of net worth. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=452.84s)]
*  You see, every four or five years, you have a bear market. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=456.52s)]
*  We're overdue. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=458.71999999999997s)]
*  Let me ask you on that. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=459.67999999999995s)]
*  You think, I mean, the markets work with whatever you want to call it, a crowd mentality. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=460.47999999999996s)]
*  You think the crowd, the zeitgeist, is still overly positive, missing that there could [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=464.76s)]
*  be more of a drop. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=470.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, yes. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=471.91999999999996s)]
*  Certain competitive stations to you, like Bloomberg, if I can mention their name. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=473.56s)]
*  Sure. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=479.04s)]
*  You seem very ecumenical. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=480.04s)]
*  Keep results, a forecast of other strategists. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=482.04s)]
*  I believe that there's only one strategist that has a lower forecast next 12 months. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=486.12s)]
*  Everybody has a higher market. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=491.0s)]
*  And interestingly enough, this profession, if you can call it a profession, poker is [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=492.52000000000004s)]
*  a maybe more attractive profession. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=496.6s)]
*  In February, all the strategists were raising their targets right when the market was peaking. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=499.24s)]
*  Now they're lowering their targets. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=504.76000000000005s)]
*  I think the problem with the market, I'm nervous about what gold is saying. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=506.52000000000004s)]
*  Gold is just streaking ahead. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=512.0400000000001s)]
*  Secondly, I don't like this tariff stuff. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=514.36s)]
*  It's created tremendous uncertainty in the business world. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=517.2s)]
*  And I think valuations are very high. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=520.12s)]
*  I don't understand when I look at the world situation, why the market's selling over 20 [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=523.88s)]
*  times earnings. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=527.28s)]
*  Yeah, and you're talking about the fundamentals of do those numbers reflect something real [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=528.36s)]
*  in the value of the thing or some other hype? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=533.8s)]
*  While I have you, I want to show you something I'm sure you know Andrew Ross Sorkin from [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=537.1999999999999s)]
*  our sort of sister channel, CNBC. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=541.88s)]
*  And he said something that you'd expect more in other more autocratic countries, but not [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=544.12s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=549.24s)]
*  But he said the way that President Trump has been going after people that he disagrees [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=551.06s)]
*  with, allegedly abusing power and executive orders to target Wall Street law firms and [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=556.44s)]
*  others, he says it's actually made CEOs self-censor the chilling effect. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=560.8800000000001s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=566.48s)]
*  A CEO said to me last week, I don't want them to Harvard me. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=567.48s)]
*  There has been a little bit, if not more than a little bit of a silencing scenario that's [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=573.1s)]
*  taking place here. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=578.32s)]
*  When you think about the way the business community feels right now about what's happening. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=580.0s)]
*  I'm really curious because you know these folks, you're in the rooms, you're in the [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=585.28s)]
*  off the record conversations. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=587.6s)]
*  Do you think that people are self-silencing, even some of them, of course, lean right or [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=589.48s)]
*  might have good relationships with the Trump Republican Party? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=593.88s)]
*  Is that a problem? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=596.48s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=597.8s)]
*  I think so. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=598.8s)]
*  I noticed today in the New York Times, which I glanced through, it was Microsoft dropped [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=600.4s)]
*  a law firm that signed on with Trump and went to a law firm that is arguing with Trump. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=605.76s)]
*  So I think that his popularity and his style has intimidated a lot of people and I don't [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=613.18s)]
*  think that's good. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=620.42s)]
*  Now, I'm a centrist, so by nature, I think the radical right or radical left is screwing [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=621.42s)]
*  up the country. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=626.14s)]
*  So I'm looking for a centrist. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=627.4799999999999s)]
*  And I did not vote for president. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=630.4599999999999s)]
*  I did not vote for Trump or I did not vote for Kamala. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=631.9s)]
*  Left to my own devices, I'm a capitalist with a heart. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=635.3399999999999s)]
*  You mentioned the giving pledge. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=638.46s)]
*  I'm giving away not only half my might to Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, I'm giving [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=639.46s)]
*  the other half away to my friend, Mike Levin, the Jewish giving pledge. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=643.94s)]
*  I'm giving away everything I have. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=647.02s)]
*  I give away my clothes, except a big guy that was interested in my clothes. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=648.58s)]
*  So in all honesty, I would say that I think Trump is doing the right thing, but he's just [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=653.12s)]
*  doing it the wrong way. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=661.02s)]
*  We have to deal with that. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=662.02s)]
*  We're heading to a crisis. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=663.02s)]
*  Here's the final question, given how much you know. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=666.7s)]
*  If somebody's listening, and I actually know a lot of folks who listen to you in the markets [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=669.7800000000001s)]
*  and elsewhere, looking at this trade war, what's done is done. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=673.26s)]
*  How would you advise fixing the problems that you say some of the tariffs have caused? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=678.94s)]
*  What would be the best thing for the American economy if you had the magic wand right now? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=683.6s)]
*  I would say reciprocal tariff policy. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=689.1800000000001s)]
*  The tariff policy of China was wrong. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=694.34s)]
*  We got to get them to reciprocal. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=697.98s)]
*  If somebody had a tariff on us, we have this tariff on them. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=700.62s)]
*  And I think the world would be better off with no tariffs, and we'll have better growth [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=703.7800000000001s)]
*  and better valuations. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=708.3000000000001s)]
*  I think we are doing- [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=711.34s)]
*  So scale back on Trump's, I mean, scale back on a lot of what Trump has been pushing. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=712.34s)]
*  Yeah, on the tariff side. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=715.62s)]
*  The other stuff he's doing on the expense side is necessary. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=717.5400000000001s)]
*  We've really have, we've denigrated ourselves into a system of leadership at a crisis. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=722.9s)]
*  We'll get leadership when we have a crisis. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=729.1s)]
*  We have not had a financial crisis. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=731.74s)]
*  We're heading to one unless we deal with these debt buildup. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=733.8199999999999s)]
*  And I feel very strongly about that. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=738.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=742.02s)]
*  Stark warnings from someone who's, like I said, bending around this. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=743.02s)]
*  I've gotten to meet you before. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=745.9399999999999s)]
*  I appreciate you coming back, and I wish you good health and good recovery. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=747.78s)]
*  Leon Cooperman, thanks for joining. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=752.14s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiK-lPOdLwM&t=754.58s)]
