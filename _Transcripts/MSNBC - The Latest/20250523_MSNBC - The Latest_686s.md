# ‘A shock to the system’: Nicolle Wallace on Donald Trump’s latest tariff threats to the E.U.
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg)
*  Hi everybody, happy Friday. It's four o'clock in New York. Well, here we go again. If you [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=0.0s)]
*  hear that screeching sound, it's just the sound of the whole of the American economy [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=6.76s)]
*  once again, swerving wildly across the interstate at 100 miles an hour. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=11.26s)]
*  Behind the wheel, one guy and one guy only. Donald Trump reignited our country's trade [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=15.94s)]
*  war today, making not one but two major and consequential announcements that stand to [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=21.62s)]
*  impact just about all of us, whether we like it or not. The first a threat, the target, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=27.42s)]
*  the EU. On social media, Donald Trump recommended, to whom no one seems to know, sweeping 50% [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=32.78s)]
*  tariffs on the European Union. They're to start on June 1st because, in his words, trade [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=40.34s)]
*  talks are, quote, going nowhere. It is a shock to the system, given something NBC News has [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=46.260000000000005s)]
*  reported early on. Quote, the EU block is America's second biggest trading partner [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=52.66s)]
*  behind China. The U.S. exported more than $350 billion of goods to the 27-nation block [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=57.5s)]
*  in recent years and imported $550 billion worth of goods. This morning, Republican Congressman [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=64.53999999999999s)]
*  French Hill, the leader of the House Financial Services Committee, was asked about this new [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=71.53999999999999s)]
*  tariff. In the language this morning, the president said that he was going to recommend [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=77.46s)]
*  a 50% tariff starting on June 1st. Who's he recommending that to? The Senate? I mean, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=82.58s)]
*  if it's not an emergency, if it's not a fentanyl situation, does he have the authority to do [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=90.74s)]
*  that? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=94.94s)]
*  I think he's recommending it to himself. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=95.94s)]
*  Yeah. I think his pitch is, you're not at the table. We need you at the table. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=96.94s)]
*  We're at the he's recommending it to himself part of the Trump tariff story. Now, whether [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=101.53999999999999s)]
*  has authority in this matter at all, the fact remains, as experts have repeated on this [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=107.58s)]
*  program and others over and over again, the cost of tariffs is eventually paid for and [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=113.38000000000001s)]
*  shouldered by the American consumers. It is a tax, which leads us to the second of Trump's [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=120.22s)]
*  big announcements today, again, made on social media. He threatened Apple with a 25% tariff [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=127.22s)]
*  unless Apple starts producing iPhones in the U.S. In the course of making that threat, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=133.5s)]
*  Trump suggested the tariff would, quote, be paid by Apple. A strange thing to say from [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=139.54s)]
*  the man who's long maintained that tariffs are paid for by other countries. But again, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=145.54s)]
*  neither is true. It's the consumer that pays. Targeting Apple in this manner would bump [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=150.54s)]
*  the price of an iPhone up to about $3,500. And consumers who might have considered another [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=155.06s)]
*  brand of phone should know just this afternoon, Trump suggested Samsung and other mobile companies [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=162.38s)]
*  could face a similar 25% tariff. That is where we start today with some of our favorite reporters [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=168.36s)]
*  and friends with me at the table. NBC News senior business correspondent Christine Romans, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=173.74s)]
*  also joining us, professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=178.5s)]
*  Justin Wolfers is back. Also joining us, former Republican Congressman David Jolly, who recently [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=183.74s)]
*  registered as a Democrat and is right now considering a run for governor of Florida. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=189.45999999999998s)]
*  Let me start with you, Christine. What is the American consumer to make of these two [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=195.54s)]
*  announcements? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=202.85999999999999s)]
*  I mean, these are, again, shifting timelines and shifting tariff levels. And I mean, it's [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=203.78s)]
*  really hard to understand how much consumers eventually would have to pay for these things [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=210.07999999999998s)]
*  because, again, is it the president negotiating? Is it the president trying to cajole Tim Cook [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=216.42000000000002s)]
*  into having more manufacturing in the United States? What is exactly the end game with [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=221.70000000000002s)]
*  the European Union? I mean, when I look at the things that the U.S. imports from the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=227.1s)]
*  European Union, it's obviously like olive oil and Parmesan cheese, but it's also car [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=230.38s)]
*  parts and drugs and medicines and medical devices and things that a 50% tariff would [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=235.84s)]
*  be really, really disruptive to those supply chains. So where we go from here, who knows? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=240.98000000000002s)]
*  But one thing that I think is very interesting, Nicole, is that on Liberation Day, so-called [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=246.18s)]
*  Liberation Day, on April 2nd, the president had a 39% tariff on the EU, which everyone [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=250.46s)]
*  said, wait, that seems way too high. He paused it. And now, before that 90-day pause is over, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=254.62s)]
*  there's a new deadline, a June deadline, and a new tariff rate of 50%. That's one of the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=261.62s)]
*  reasons why markets are so unsettled. They don't see the strategy and they don't understand [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=265.66s)]
*  the follow-through. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=269.78000000000003s)]
*  Well, are they looking for a strategy or have the markets recognized yet that with Donald [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=270.78000000000003s)]
*  Trump there isn't one? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=274.26s)]
*  I think markets are just concerned that businesses don't have any certainty. If you're a business [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=276.38s)]
*  who imports any of those things I just mentioned for the EU, what in the world are you doing [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=282.82s)]
*  as you're making your orders right now, trying to decide what you're bringing in and at what [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=286.3s)]
*  price point and what you're going to use it in your business for, what you're going to [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=290.18s)]
*  sell it for? It's just there's no clarity for these businesses still. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=293.54s)]
*  We had been in a period of de-escalation and you saw markets come back from where they [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=297.46000000000004s)]
*  had been in April with all that chaos. Markets slowly came back and recovered all of those [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=301.86s)]
*  losses. And now we've shifted, it feels like, today, in one day, from de-escalation to the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=306.58s)]
*  brand new threats with new timelines and new tariff levels. And so that's just injected [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=311.7s)]
*  all this uncertainty back into everything. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=316.86s)]
*  Do markets think that there's anyone checking Trump in the same way they did during 1.0 [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=319.18s)]
*  and they saw people like Gary Cohn and Steve Mnuchin around Trump and they felt at least [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=326.26s)]
*  somewhat reassured that before he blew up our trading, our second largest trading partner [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=333.98s)]
*  relationship that someone could stop him. Do they view this cabinet differently? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=340.21999999999997s)]
*  There had been a feeling among a lot of market participants and economists and business leaders [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=344.58s)]
*  that Scott Besson was the shock absorber on the car. You had that great metaphor and you're [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=351.02s)]
*  open of this car driving 100 miles an hour on the highway. And that Scott Besson was [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=355.26s)]
*  the shock absorber there. But it seems as though there was an EU-US call planned for [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=361.53999999999996s)]
*  today, and the president still made these threats. And it seemed as though, what is [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=368.34s)]
*  the strategy there? Was that before the meeting? Was it after the meeting? Either way, markets [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=374.14s)]
*  were unsettled there. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=378.3s)]
*  I want to come to you, David Jelle, with a question about this. What I find interesting [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=381.34000000000003s)]
*  is that for me, watching Trump destroy the economy was just like watching Trump destroy [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=390.78000000000003s)]
*  the FBI and just like watching Trump destroy DOJ and just like watching Trump tap Hexeth [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=395.0s)]
*  to destroy the Pentagon in 2.0 and just like watching Trump tap Tulsi Gabbard to destroy [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=402.28000000000003s)]
*  the intelligence community. It was simply another arena where he was going to be chaotic [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=407.46s)]
*  and unsettling, to borrow Christine's word, and unpredictable. What about the fact that [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=412.38s)]
*  he is now indifferent to market swings? Is new and notable to you? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=419.46s)]
*  Look, I think there are weeks where we have to recognize, revisit the conversation, that [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=424.46s)]
*  he is increasingly unstable and arguably unwell. The problem is he is able to wield executive [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=429.3s)]
*  power in areas of national and economic security. And Nicole, if you were trying to destroy [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=435.9s)]
*  a nation from the outside, but much less from within, you would do a couple of things. You [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=440.9s)]
*  would first break our security alliances, our security alliances with the West, our [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=445.9s)]
*  long-held allies. You would empower our enemies. We have seen that in the first hundred-plus [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=450.9s)]
*  days. You would also disrupt our domestic economy. That is essentially what he is attacking [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=455.9s)]
*  at this point, to your point. And third, you would break the ability of the government [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=461.65999999999997s)]
*  to provide services to its people. That is complete disruption, not only of government, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=465.65999999999997s)]
*  but of culture and of society. And Donald Trump seems to not care about the fallout [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=469.65999999999997s)]
*  from this. I think it raises hard questions, as always, for Republicans then. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=474.65999999999997s)]
*  Look, Donald Trump won't be on the ballot again. Republicans have failed to check in. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=479.65999999999997s)]
*  They have elevated and celebrated him. But what happens when they go home over Memorial [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=483.65999999999997s)]
*  Day weekend and during a recess? I mean, you are looking at a president who is declaring [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=488.42s)]
*  economic warfare on our allies at the same time that the Congress is passing a bill to [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=493.42s)]
*  explode our debt and our deficits and also delivery of health care services to seniors [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=498.42s)]
*  and those in need. So what type of positioning is this for today's Republican Party that [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=504.42s)]
*  they find defensible? I think we're seeing it in the numbers, and I think Republicans [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=509.42s)]
*  right now are terrified. But outside of the political question, we should all be terrified [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=514.18s)]
*  because this is a president who has destabilized the world order in terms of our own national [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=518.18s)]
*  security interests as well as our economic security. Look, at some point we do have to [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=524.18s)]
*  revisit the conversation that this is a president who is unstable and increasingly unwell. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=529.18s)]
*  Well, to your point about the numbers, I mean, 66% of all Americans disapprove of Donald [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=533.18s)]
*  Trump's handling of inflation. That's 66% of Americans. 66% of Americans didn't vote [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=539.9399999999999s)]
*  for Kamala Harris. That's 66% of Americans who are available to vote for someone who [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=545.9399999999999s)]
*  is against Donald Trump's handling of inflation. 63% of all Americans disapprove of Donald [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=550.9399999999999s)]
*  Trump's tariff policy before, as Christine also pointed out, we're on a 90-day pause. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=555.9399999999999s)]
*  They haven't even hit. So before they've even hit, 63% of all Americans disapprove of Donald [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=560.9399999999999s)]
*  Trump's tariff policy. There are 63% of Americans who are available to a politician who is against [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=566.7s)]
*  Donald Trump's approach to tariffs and inflation, David. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=572.7s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly right, Nicole. And look, given all of the controversy around the last [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=576.7s)]
*  year of the Biden administration, the one thing we know is they had largely brought [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=580.7s)]
*  with the assistance of the Fed, of course, arguably the leadership of the Fed. Donald [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=584.7s)]
*  Trump inherited an economy that was relatively stable. Real wages were up. Labor markets [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=588.7s)]
*  were tight. Unemployment was down. The stock market was at an all-time high. We were at [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=593.7s)]
*  least seeing certainty, right? Inflation causes a certain amount of uncertainty, of course, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4KurSyCvg&t=598.6600000000001s)]
