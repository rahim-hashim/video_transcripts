# ‘It would be comical if it wasn’t the nation’s health on the line.’: Symone Sanders on RFK Jr.
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg)
*  Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=0.0s)]
*  sat before a House committee today defending his overhaul of the federal health agencies. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=4.8s)]
*  He was also pressed on the jump in measles cases and his vaccine skepticism. Watch this. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=9.44s)]
*  If you had a child today, would you vaccinate that child for measles? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=16.64s)]
*  For measles? Probably for measles. I, you know, what I would say is my opinions about [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=20.16s)]
*  vaccines are irrelevant. I don't think people should be taking advice, medical advice from me. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=29.76s)]
*  But that's kind of your jurisdiction because CDC does give advice, right? I'm not trying to do it [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=35.52s)]
*  as a gotcha. The nightcap is still with us. It would be, it would be comical if this was not like [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=39.2s)]
*  the nation's health on the line and the information. Like he, he really said I don't think people [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=48.32s)]
*  should be taking medical advice from me, Jason. Imagine if you're like in a dentist chair and your [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=54.8s)]
*  mouth is open and they're already in there. You're like, you have any suggestions for how to take care [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=60.16s)]
*  of my teeth? What are you asking me for? I just, I just have your mouth open and you're laying here [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  in the middle of my office. That's what this is. That's what this is. It's going to the garage and [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=67.6s)]
*  asking the mechanic and they're like, I don't know anything about cars. I ride a bike. Look, the man [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=72.08s)]
*  is an idiot. We've known he's an idiot. I don't use that term lightly, right? Because I don't, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=76.0s)]
*  I don't like sort of the pejorative insults. He is an idiot. He does not know things. He is not [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=80.16s)]
*  responsible. Well, you know, some things he just obviously doesn't know anything about HHS. Yeah, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=84.8s)]
*  HHS or, or whether it's safe to jump in water or what you should do with a bear carcass, right? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=88.72s)]
*  So I don't know why any of us should be surprised that these are the kinds of things he says. What [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=93.2s)]
*  always concerns me when RFK Jr. says his next crazy thing, whether it's about vaccines or [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  something else like that, is how he's going to be held accountable by Congress or any other agency, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  because he can be a crazy person on his own, but people have to enact his crazy. And that's [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=105.92s)]
*  where I hope people step up. Here's the thing. I don't think people should take medical advice. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=109.92s)]
*  I don't think they, I think his medical advice would be quite bad. Obviously that's talking [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=115.36s)]
*  in a contaminated rock. He may or may not have a brain worm. Like what we, what are we doing here? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=119.44s)]
*  Obviously this is a real problem. I mean, an epically bad problem where the head of our Health [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=125.2s)]
*  and Human Services Agency doesn't have or desire the scientific expertise to clearly state that [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=132.0s)]
*  children should get vaccinated for clinically proven vaccines that have done incredible good [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=139.68s)]
*  for our society. And every time he opens his mouth and can't answer that question succinctly [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=145.04000000000002s)]
*  and clearly is a massive lost opportunity to educate the public, especially the people who [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=150.4s)]
*  hang on his every word. Of course, all this is coming amidst a horrible measles outbreak in West [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=156.32s)]
*  Texas that has claimed lives of several small kids. And the fact that that has not woken him up [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=162.56s)]
*  suggests that the conspiracies are just ingrained way too deep at this point and that we are in for [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  a very dangerous couple of years. I also don't think that people should be personally taking [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  medical advice from the, from secretary Kennedy. However, the agency that he runs is in charge of [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=179.20000000000002s)]
*  issuing advice. And that was Pocahontas point. And that was Pocahontas point. And so it's just kind of [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=188.24s)]
*  like what are Republicans, Melanie, on Capitol Hill saying, because the senators, even Bill Cassidy, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  who's a doctor, I would note who had concerns about RFK junior, he voted to confirm him. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=198.48s)]
*  Yeah. And he's the chairman of the Senate health committee where they also had testimony from the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=204.0s)]
*  secretary today. I was really looking out for Cassidy's tone today because he was wavering on [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=208.48s)]
*  whether to confirm Kennedy or not. He's a doctor and he got these commitments from secretary Kennedy [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  to promote vaccines and to say, my past comments are in the past. I'm not going to promote my own [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=220.88s)]
*  personal beliefs. I will do the will of the president. And he clearly has not done that [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=226.48s)]
*  since becoming secretary. So was Cassidy going to hold his feet to the fire? And by and large, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=230.48s)]
*  he didn't. Cassidy didn't even bring up vaccines. He told reporters afterwards, I think he's keeping [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=235.04s)]
*  his promises. And at one point he did interject to sort of correct the record about one misstatement [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=238.95999999999998s)]
*  that Kennedy made, but for the most part, he was, he was praising the secretary. And so I think with [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=244.0s)]
*  Cassidy, he's a perfect example. He is facing a primary threat from a far right challenger. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  He voted to convict Donald Trump in the impeachment trial. So I think he's doing some work to win over [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=255.6s)]
*  MAGA world. And unfortunately, that means he needs to suck up to the secretary. Even when you have [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=260.4s)]
*  the sense that personally, he might not agree with that. It's very interesting to the point that [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=266.08s)]
*  Democrats frankly are not being bullish, but they're saying, Hey, maybe Louisiana could be in play [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=270.08s)]
*  or in all these other places, given what is happening within the dynamics of the Republican [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=274.64s)]
*  caucuses across the country, given the politics of the president, the people in his cabinet. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TevIbBF6Rbg&t=279.12s)]
