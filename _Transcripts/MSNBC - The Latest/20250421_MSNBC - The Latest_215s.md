# DHS confirms Kristi Noem's bag with $3,000 in cash stolen from D.C. restaurant
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY)
*  A major security breach for DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, the department confirming that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=0.0s)]
*  her bag, which had $3,000 cash inside, was stolen while she was eating Easter dinner [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=6.16s)]
*  at a D.C. restaurant last night. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=12.4s)]
*  NBC Homeland Security correspondent Julia Ainsley is following this story for us. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=14.56s)]
*  What do we know about what happened here? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=19.68s)]
*  Yeah, well, Chris, it's exactly as you laid out that she was eating Easter dinner. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=21.48s)]
*  We understand with numerous members of her family, about six or seven people present [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=25.64s)]
*  in a popular downtown D.C. restaurant. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=30.52s)]
*  Of course, everywhere she goes is with Secret Service, but somehow, in the middle of even [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=33.44s)]
*  having a Secret Service detail there, someone was able to steal her purse. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=37.8s)]
*  And inside, you mentioned the $3,000. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  I think that's kind of the most jaw-dropping. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=44.64s)]
*  We asked DHS why she had that much cash. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  They said that she got this out to be able to spend it on things like Easter gifts and [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=48.88s)]
*  dinner for her family. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=53.2s)]
*  We're not exactly clear why there was cash needed for that, but also her badge. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=54.6s)]
*  And that's really where you get into the security part of this. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=58.88s)]
*  And so we're reaching out to see if they've turned off that badge, because, of course, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=61.52s)]
*  they can use those to access buildings or even electronics in some cases. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=65.04s)]
*  Now, our Yamiche Alcindor was in a unique position today at the White House Easter Egg [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=69.12s)]
*  Roll to be able to ask Christina about this as soon as it happens. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=72.48s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=75.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=84.56s)]
*  Sorry that that happened, first of all. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=85.56s)]
*  Yamiche with NBC News, just like concerned that you were worried about that. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=87.44s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=91.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's not recently. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=92.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=95.64s)]
*  Do you know if the Secret Service has any leads on it or anything? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=96.64s)]
*  I have no idea what to say about it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=99.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=101.64s)]
*  So she said there, it's not resolved yet. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=104.36s)]
*  And we should say we've reached out to Secret Service just like we would whenever there's [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=106.56s)]
*  a security breach like this. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=109.84s)]
*  They're referring all questions back to DHS, which, of course, does oversee Secret Service. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=111.56s)]
*  But yeah, a lot of unanswered questions and some head scratching about the situation. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=116.36s)]
*  But another question, again, about how people are protecting their access to secure information [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  and how detailees are being protected. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=126.12s)]
*  Of course, we always want to know the answers, especially after the major breach last summer [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=128.68s)]
*  against President Trump with the assassination attempt. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=133.36s)]
*  Yeah, just to go back to the badge for a quick second, I very much remember when I got my [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=136.12s)]
*  hard pass, is what we call it, when I was a White House correspondent. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=141.4s)]
*  And I remember the senior producer at the White House basically looking me in the eye [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=145.72s)]
*  and saying, you guard this with your life. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=150.48000000000002s)]
*  You do not lose this. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=152.96s)]
*  You do not ever not know where it is. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=154.12s)]
*  But they should have the ability in this case, right, to deny access. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=156.76s)]
*  They have the electronic capability of doing that. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=161.04000000000002s)]
*  But it is, even though it is a security concern. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=164.0s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=167.16s)]
*  We just haven't gotten to that piece yet. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=169.16s)]
*  She said it's an ongoing issue. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=171.16s)]
*  I'm sure that there's a way to deny access to the building. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=172.48000000000002s)]
*  I think it's really just surprising for people to realize this is the kind of thing you can [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=174.96s)]
*  carry in your purse. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=178.32s)]
*  It can be stolen out of a restaurant, even with secret service around you. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=179.32s)]
*  And we should say for a lot of government employees, they also use those badges to plug [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=182.4s)]
*  into computers to be able to access information. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=186.08s)]
*  Absolutely no indications anything like that happened in this case. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=188.56s)]
*  We're just talking about how important these pieces of plastic are. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elthVI-WvnY&t=192.0s)]
