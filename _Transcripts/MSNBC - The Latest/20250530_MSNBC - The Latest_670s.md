# Elon Musk loses job, power and $50B! Melber on Musk's losing bet in Trump 2nd term
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc)
*  An experiment in both governance and billionaire power grabs is ending. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=0.0s)]
*  And it's kind of different than what we might have thought when it began. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=6.72s)]
*  Elon Musk leaving his government work. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=9.24s)]
*  And he made this what is basically an admitted exit kind of interview final appearance with [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=11.94s)]
*  the president. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=17.22s)]
*  And as with other situations with loud, powerful or political people, sometimes even when they [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=19.16s)]
*  admit something or reality suggests something like he has less power than he did on day [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=25.12s)]
*  one and he's leaving, we're still hearing that he'll be around. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=30.12s)]
*  I expect to remain a friend and an advisor. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  And certainly if there's anything the president wants me to do, I'm at the president's service. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=40.0s)]
*  Elon has worked tirelessly helping lead the most sweeping and consequential government [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=44.8s)]
*  reform program in generations. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=49.68s)]
*  Will the real president please stand up? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=55.44s)]
*  You might say to paraphrase Eminem, Elon Musk standing over the proceedings, a kind of physical [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=58.16s)]
*  way that he likes to announce himself just as he did in cabinet meetings. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=63.6s)]
*  But of course, the real president seated was watching him stand up to go. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=67.18s)]
*  And while they said some nice things about each other, let's be clear that on the evidence, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=72.12s)]
*  which is how we all try to keep track of things if we're being serious in journalism or policy, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=76.52s)]
*  you have to count it up. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=81.67999999999999s)]
*  A lot of these things did not work as they were claimed to work. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=82.67999999999999s)]
*  A lot of these so-called savings did not materialize. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=87.32s)]
*  And that's before you even get to counting up the cost of some of these cuts. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=90.96s)]
*  Now, Musk set out to save $150 billion. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  That's what he says he might have gotten. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=99.24s)]
*  Of course, that's far less than the trillions he promised. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=100.47999999999999s)]
*  And he is leaving. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=103.64s)]
*  He could have taken a permanent position where he'd have to do more transparency or divest, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=104.64s)]
*  but instead, he's getting out of dodge. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=108.64s)]
*  There are independent reports which suggest if you look at actual verified savings and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=111.16s)]
*  not the sort of rosy estimates, you get down to $16 billion. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=116.32s)]
*  In federal dollars, when you talk about multi-year programs, that's actually a tiny slice. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=122.72s)]
*  The New York Times reports that the approach, what I just mentioned, how the things work, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=128.3s)]
*  and then sometimes rehiring, the productivity loss, paid leave for the people that they [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=132.48s)]
*  fired when they didn't really have a plan worked out, also adds upwards of $135 billion [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=136.48s)]
*  in the fiscal year. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=143.23999999999998s)]
*  Now, because this was so chaotic and fast, they, the government, and they, the New York [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=145.2s)]
*  Times and reports, and we here at MSNBC cannot give you a full and exact accounting. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=151.48s)]
*  I can just show you that when it's all said and done, he may have cost more than he saved, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=156.72s)]
*  and he was supposed to be Mr. Savings. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=162.08s)]
*  Now, we don't know why different information leaks out when it does, but on this tough [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=164.36s)]
*  news day for Mr. Musk and a tough day for him in politics as he kind of steps back, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=168.96s)]
*  there are quite serious reports about his use of drugs while cozying up to Trump on [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=174.04s)]
*  the campaign trail as recently as last year. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=181.48s)]
*  Now, Times puts it that he was using drugs more intensely than previously known. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=184.4s)]
*  The article lists, quote, ketamine, ecstasy, psychedelic mushrooms, Adderall. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=189.12s)]
*  That is a serious set of claims, and while people can debate what private individuals [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=195.04s)]
*  do, whether it breaks the law or not, and how newsworthy that is, this matters for someone [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=201.04s)]
*  who is wielding government power, who was overseeing programs where they fire people. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=205.56s)]
*  Some people in the federal government can be removed for drug use. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=210.2s)]
*  He was working as a special employee in the federal government, and the Times is reporting [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=212.6s)]
*  about that. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=216.51999999999998s)]
*  I also want to tell you that while that's in the Times, NBC News has not confirmed it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  Now, Musk has discussed some of these issues. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=221.64s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  But you've admitted that you've had, you have a ketamine subscription, prescription. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=225.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=230.0s)]
*  Do you think you're inebriated when you do ketamine? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=231.0s)]
*  No, if you do a lot of ketamine, then you're inebriated. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=234.0s)]
*  If you do a small amount, you're not. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=237.0s)]
*  That's my question about do you ever abuse it. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=239.76s)]
*  That's why. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=241.88s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=242.88s)]
*  That was an exchange there with journalist Don Lemon, who was then ousted from X, which [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=245.88s)]
*  Musk had bought, after that interview. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=252.07999999999998s)]
*  I do want to note in the timeline, because some of this has to do with his political [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=255.0s)]
*  and government activities, the interview itself. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=258.06s)]
*  There was before the campaign time that he was spending with Trump, and the Times reports [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=259.84s)]
*  that it did go, they say, and they're reporting, his usage was beyond what you might call, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=264.64s)]
*  quote, occasional use. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=269.68s)]
*  Now, with regard to whether this affects his wielding of federal powers, that report does [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=271.76s)]
*  not state whether this was happening in the last 120 days during this period. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=278.32s)]
*  Musk also sidestepping a question about it at that press conference. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=282.64s)]
*  He went on the attack against journalism instead of just addressing it. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=285.6s)]
*  The White House also put out statements praising Musk, but has not addressed those issues separately. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=289.2s)]
*  All of this news is coming as Musk is leaving an operation where even he doesn't claim he [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=295.52s)]
*  succeeded, leaving public service having lost many billions of dollars because the public [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=300.88s)]
*  had views about his service, and it affected him. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=308.24s)]
*  And he is now distancing himself from at least some Trump policies. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=311.36s)]
*  It's not like I agree with everything the administration does. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=316.6s)]
*  I'm a little stuck in a bind where I'm like, well, I don't want to speak up against the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=320.24s)]
*  administration, but I don't want to also don't want to take responsibility for everything [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=326.28s)]
*  the administration is doing. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=332.36s)]
*  Welcome to public service. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=336.52s)]
*  The difference between Musk and virtually everyone else who signs up to work for a president [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=339.2s)]
*  is most people treat it like the serious full-time job that it is. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=343.59999999999997s)]
*  They take an oath to the Constitution. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=347.64s)]
*  They understand as long as you're in that job, you do do the thing he said he didn't [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=349.08s)]
*  want to do. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=352.71999999999997s)]
*  And that's along with the values and plans of the person you work for, in this case the [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=354.24s)]
*  president, or if you reach a breaking point, you quit. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=357.24s)]
*  Musk is again trying to have it both ways, and he has clearly basked in some of the power [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=360.68s)]
*  and attention of being tied to the president and donating a lot of money to the president [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=364.44000000000005s)]
*  when they were running last year while also wanting to make the break in ways that benefit [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=368.32000000000005s)]
*  or matter to him. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=372.52000000000004s)]
*  He did express disapproval, disagreement with aspects of that budget, and he noted that [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=374.06s)]
*  it is in conflict with his supposed goal of saving money, which he's leaving having not [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=379.12s)]
*  achieved. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=383.04s)]
*  Meanwhile, we have the tariffs, which many business leaders continue to oppose, the way [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=384.04s)]
*  Trump launched them, how they've affected chaotic markets this week, getting a court [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=388.68s)]
*  setback. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=392.88s)]
*  The Treasury secretary is still going back and forth about how Trump's inconsistent [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=394.0s)]
*  messaging towards China and whether there'll be high, medium, or low tariffs, how that's [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=399.16s)]
*  affecting negotiations there. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=403.0s)]
*  I would say that they are a bit stalled. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=406.48s)]
*  There was a time when the president thought that that was moving forward pretty significantly. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=412.0s)]
*  Again, I think that given the magnitude of the talks, given the complexity, that this [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=417.0s)]
*  is going to require both leaders to weigh in with each other. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=426.67999999999995s)]
*  That's the Trump perspective. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=432.84s)]
*  Those are the people defending how this is going, and I guess because they've dealt with [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=437.44s)]
*  so much reality, setbacks, market feedback, they are finding that just lying or claiming [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=441.24s)]
*  that things are perfect doesn't work. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=446.92s)]
*  So we're hearing a still best-case scenario of failed trade war policies. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=448.76s)]
*  We've gone from 90 deals in 90 days to maybe we're going to get a deal to the deals are [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=454.76s)]
*  stalled. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=460.36s)]
*  Now there's a report that says this trade war thus far has already cost over $30 billion [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=461.96s)]
*  Not all of that will be felt by people overnight. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=467.47999999999996s)]
*  Reuters making the point that the lost sales, the higher costs, will kind of spread out [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=470.12s)]
*  as costs across the economy, and they'll be paid by a lot of regular people. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=474.91999999999996s)]
*  Here's a toy company CEO speaking out today. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=479.76s)]
*  Because the rules change every two days, like we're stuck in some sort of telenovela, you [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=484.4s)]
*  don't really know what to do. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=489.59999999999997s)]
*  We are constantly making decisions with guesses because we don't know what the rules are. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=491.64s)]
*  This is our own government doing this to us, which is shocking. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=498.08s)]
*  It's absolutely shocking. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=502.47999999999996s)]
*  That continues to happen. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=506.08s)]
*  And while on some days the trade war might not feel like big news, it might not have [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=507.15999999999997s)]
*  another inflection point, it is the daily life and setback of so many of these companies [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=511.97999999999996s)]
*  and businesses. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=518.24s)]
*  This is not necessarily at this point a big story about ideology. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=520.42s)]
*  It's become a story about competence and incompetence. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=524.06s)]
*  A U.S. government led by Donald Trump claiming, we're going to do this thing, and then failing [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=526.62s)]
*  to do that thing, and then the thing they're doing costing Americans a lot of money. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=531.9s)]
*  And the whole point in the beginning was it was going to save us money or make us stronger [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=536.4599999999999s)]
*  against other countries. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=539.8s)]
*  Over at the ports, the reporting shows the inconsistency is taking its toll. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=541.5s)]
*  One official saying one day it makes sense to ship, the next day it doesn't. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=547.6s)]
*  Over in Europe, a trade negotiator says it doesn't make any sense to negotiate about [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=550.48s)]
*  tariffs that might be proved illegal, citing the U.S. court ruling against Trump this week. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=554.2s)]
*  The courts leave some latitude for Congress and the president to do normal tariffing and [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=560.08s)]
*  normal trade work. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=566.2s)]
*  That's why if you think back, even if you're not following it that closely, you might not [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=567.92s)]
*  remember huge court rulings against the trade policies of the last several presidents in [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=571.98s)]
*  both parties. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=577.66s)]
*  But Trump on this issue, like on immigration, has pushed these laws past the breaking point. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=579.0600000000001s)]
*  And that's why he's getting adverse rulings. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=584.3000000000001s)]
*  Take the Fox News sister outlet, the Wall Street Journal. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=586.94s)]
*  Their very pro-trade, pro-Wall Street editorial board says it's time that court ruling put [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=589.98s)]
*  Trump, he's the chief executive, put Trump in his proper constitutional place, noting [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=598.54s)]
*  he is no tariff king. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=604.86s)]
*  And he's not supposed to be. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=606.62s)]
*  Some Republicans are pointing out the obvious problems. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=608.52s)]
*  Karl Rove, the Bush Republican who at times has clashed with Trump, says their messaging [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=610.6999999999999s)]
*  is a muddled mess and Trump's chaotic trade war badly damages Republicans, he warns, going [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=614.7199999999999s)]
*  into the midterms. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=620.28s)]
*  So is it as bad as it looks or is it worse? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=622.0999999999999s)]
*  That's the fairest way you can put it, even if you only cite sources like the Wall Street [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=626.5s)]
*  Journal and Karl Rove to say nothing of other independent analysts and liberal critics who [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=630.2199999999999s)]
*  say Trump's second hundred days are even more of a disaster than the first, which is why [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=635.3s)]
*  he's losing from the markets to the courts. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAzyKXKusjc&t=640.4599999999999s)]
