# California mayors call for end to federal immigration raids
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo)
*  Farmers are being hurt badly by, you know, they have very good workers, they've worked [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=0.0s)]
*  for them for 20 years, they're not citizens, but they've turned out to be great. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=5.36s)]
*  And we're going to have to do something about that. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  We can't take farmers and take all their people and send them back because they don't have [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=12.9s)]
*  maybe what they're supposed to have, maybe not. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=18.28s)]
*  And you know what's going to happen and what is happening? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=21.2s)]
*  They get rid of some of the people because, you know, you go into a farm and you look [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=23.32s)]
*  at people don't they've been there for 20, 25 years and they've worked great and the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=27.4s)]
*  owner of the farm loves them and everything else. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=31.68s)]
*  And then you're supposed to throw them out. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=34.2s)]
*  And you know what happens? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=36.36s)]
*  They end up hiring the people, the criminals that have come in, the murderers from prisons [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=37.36s)]
*  and everything else. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=41.04s)]
*  So we're we're going to have an order on that pretty soon. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=42.2s)]
*  I think we can't do that to our farmers and leisure to hotels. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=45.2s)]
*  We're going to have to use a lot of common sense on that. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=49.96s)]
*  I was President Trump at the White House yesterday saying he will soon take action to protect [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=54.48s)]
*  undocumented farm and hospitality workers from ICE deportation rates, seemingly starting [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=58.64s)]
*  to understand the reality on the ground that advocates have long talked about that some [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  of these folks are seamless members of their community. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=67.92s)]
*  Can't just be ripped out. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=71.32s)]
*  Meanwhile, parts of downtown Los Angeles are under another night of curfew restrictions [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=72.52s)]
*  as Mayor Karen Bass tries to clamp down on protests in the city. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=76.4s)]
*  The Los Angeles Police Department reported 78 arrests overnight for charges including [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=80.0s)]
*  failure to disperse and curfew violations. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=84.04s)]
*  Crowds were also reported throwing concrete and commercial grade fireworks at officers, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=86.92s)]
*  but there were no reports of arrests for vandalism and looting. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=91.08000000000001s)]
*  Thousands of National Guard troops remain stationed throughout the city. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=94.52000000000001s)]
*  And today, a battalion of 700 Marines is expected to arrive. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=97.56s)]
*  The service members have been deployed to guard buildings and federal law enforcement [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=101.32000000000001s)]
*  convoys as they conduct immigration sweeps. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=104.56s)]
*  Yesterday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem vowed the Trump administration would not [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  let up in its crackdown on immigrants without legal status or on protesters. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=111.56s)]
*  Her remarks come despite more than 20 California mayors and local officials calling for an [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=116.28s)]
*  end to federal immigration raids. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=120.48s)]
*  And when it comes to those troops, we knew this was going through the courts. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=124.0s)]
*  A federal appeals court ruled last night that the Trump administration can maintain control [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=126.44s)]
*  of the 4,000 National Guard troops deployed to California amid anti-ICE protests there. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=131.48000000000002s)]
*  The late night ruling reversed a lower court judge's order from earlier that afternoon. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=136.84s)]
*  A federal judge had told the administration to return control of the forces to California [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=140.82s)]
*  Governor Gavin Newsom. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=145.02s)]
*  But the Trump administration quickly filed an appeal, resulting in a temporary pause [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=146.52s)]
*  of the lower court's ruling. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=150.14s)]
*  Then the appeals court will hold a hearing on the matter next week. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=151.74s)]
*  Newsom has opposed Trump's decision to deploy the troops, arguing the presence of militarized [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=155.74s)]
*  law enforcement will only intensify protests. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=160.08s)]
*  I want to bring in now board chair of the grassroots organization Community Coalition, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=163.82s)]
*  also the executive director of BlackPak, Adrian Schropshire. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=168.14s)]
*  BlackPak is a political action committee focused on mobilizing and engaging with African American [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=171.45999999999998s)]
*  voters. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=175.5s)]
*  Adrian, thank you for joining us. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=176.5s)]
*  I know it's very early where you are. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=177.5s)]
*  I want to talk to you a little bit about the chilling effect that we have heard about in [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=178.98s)]
*  some of these immigrant communities. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=183.01999999999998s)]
*  I wonder what you're seeing as you talk to folks on the ground there, what you're seeing [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=185.01999999999998s)]
*  in your community. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=189.27999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think all of the stories that you all have talked about, have reported on, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=190.27999999999997s)]
*  are true. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=195.54s)]
*  We are seeing people who are afraid and feel terrorized. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=196.78s)]
*  We've heard the stories about families being ripped apart at elementary school graduations. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=203.5s)]
*  You've heard the stories of day laborers at Home Depot's. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=210.22s)]
*  I know that at my Home Depot that I shop at, the men who are there looking for work are [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=214.34s)]
*  Senegalese and they're no longer there. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=219.34s)]
*  I don't know where they are, but they are no longer there. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=221.7s)]
*  We had a member and we've had many members who have witnessed, not experienced themselves, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=225.1s)]
*  but one member sitting at a bus stop when an unmarked van pulled up and snatched two [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=229.46s)]
*  young women and their young children off of the bus stop. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=234.56s)]
*  The other folks who were sitting there were scared. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=237.57999999999998s)]
*  They didn't know if another van was going to come by and gather up the rest of them. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=241.0s)]
*  So there really is just terror throughout the community. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=245.26s)]
*  People are afraid. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=249.14s)]
*  And it is both, you know, those folks that are directly impacted, those folks who feel [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=250.89999999999998s)]
*  like they can't leave their homes, who are calling their priests and asking if they think [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=255.94s)]
*  it's safe for them to come to church, children who don't want to go to school, who are begging [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=261.53999999999996s)]
*  their parents not to leave the house. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=266.76s)]
*  It feels like we are a city that is occupied and under assault by our own government. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=269.26s)]
*  Well, you mentioned that you feel that the city is occupied. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=274.02s)]
*  Of course, the troops are there on the ground. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=277.9s)]
*  You've been in the grassroots organizing movement for decades. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=280.94s)]
*  I mean, protest culture, peaceful protest culture is really in the fabric of this country. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=284.21999999999997s)]
*  Free speech, the ability to protest what your government is doing if you disagree with it. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=289.58s)]
*  So layer on top of it now that we're in a moment where National Guard troops have been [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=293.78s)]
*  sent in. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=297.82s)]
*  What is the effect that they have on the ground? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=298.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=300.62s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think that it, you know, I was organizing in Los Angeles after the 1992 [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=301.62s)]
*  uprising. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=307.5s)]
*  And I can tell you that what we experienced then is light years away from where we are [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=309.06s)]
*  now. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=316.18s)]
*  I have been downtown multiple times over the last few days. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=317.18s)]
*  The protests that I have seen have been peaceful. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=320.42s)]
*  We've seen prayer vigils led by clergy. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=324.46s)]
*  I've seen, you know, protests walk past me because they're going in all different directions [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=327.74s)]
*  with young people waving flags and chanting, and they're peaceful. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=331.46s)]
*  I think that when we have the National Guard federalized and in our city, it is clearly [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=335.7s)]
*  a provocation. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=342.09999999999997s)]
*  It is an effort to incite the people of Los Angeles. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=343.09999999999997s)]
*  But it is true that the Angelenos are not only fearless, but they're really clear about [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=348.21999999999997s)]
*  the values of the city. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=353.21999999999997s)]
*  And people are out there in the street because they want to uphold those values. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=355.06s)]
*  They care about their neighbors. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=358.38s)]
*  They do not want to see their neighbors disappeared and kidnapped. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=359.74s)]
*  And they don't want to feel like they are under siege and they want to send a message [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=363.46s)]
*  that it is not OK, that the raids need to end, and that the military forces in our city [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=367.3s)]
*  need to leave. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=372.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=373.28s)]
*  And I think that for those who might be thinking about protesting this weekend, it comes against [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=374.28s)]
*  a backdrop where we just saw yesterday, and we're going to dig into this story a little [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=378.42s)]
*  bit later in the show. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=382.5s)]
*  Senator Alex Padilla, the senior senator from California, going into a meeting with the [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=383.66s)]
*  department, the head of the Department of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, trying to [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=388.46s)]
*  ask her a question and being pretty forcibly removed from that room. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=392.34000000000003s)]
*  He was handcuffed, detained, not arrested. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=396.86s)]
*  But still, what kind of an impact do those images have on folks who might be thinking [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  about protesting this weekend? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=405.02s)]
*  Because there were protests planned far before what we saw play out on the ground in L.A. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=407.18s)]
*  Yeah, I think people are pretty determined to exercise their constitutionally protected [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=411.74s)]
*  right. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=416.3s)]
*  And I don't think that that's going to deter them. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=417.3s)]
*  What we saw with Senator Padilla yesterday was completely outrageous. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=418.82s)]
*  For a sitting U.S. Senator to be treated in such a manner, to be taken down to the ground [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=423.58s)]
*  and handcuffed is completely outrageous. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=427.94s)]
*  And we also know that our organizations, the institutions that represent immigrant communities, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=431.02s)]
*  that provide services to immigrant communities are also under attack. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=437.9s)]
*  We've seen Chirla here in Los Angeles receive a letter from Josh Hawley accusing them of [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=441.85999999999996s)]
*  and mischaracterizing the work that they have done for decades to support and help immigrants [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=449.29999999999995s)]
*  in this city completely mischaracterize them and being accused of all kinds of outrageous [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=454.78s)]
*  things. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=460.21999999999997s)]
*  We see these kinds of attacks, the direct attacks both on our elected officials, on [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=461.70000000000005s)]
*  our organizations. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=468.22s)]
*  But I think that people are determined to say that this is not the version of America [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM-AyZRy0Wo&t=469.3s)]
