Video Description: Rachel Maddow points out Donald Trump's disproportionate reaction to the possibility that Senate Republicans will vote for a bill that would take away Trump's ability to arbitrarily set tariffs, and shares her expectation that in the next 100 days, Trump will try to change course from his failed policies with increasingly dramatic and extreme stunts.

# Trump panics at the prospect of Republicans turning against him over abysmal poll numbers
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U)
*  Today, Donald Trump started threatening Republican U.S. senators that they better not vote against [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=0.0s)]
*  him this week on this tariffs bill. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=6.0s)]
*  This is a bill that's going to come up in the Senate that has precisely zero chance [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=8.08s)]
*  of becoming law because they're never even going to vote on it in the Republican-controlled [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=11.24s)]
*  House. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  Even if it passed the Senate, it would go nowhere. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=16.04s)]
*  There's no chance it can actually become law. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=18.12s)]
*  Still, though, Trump appears to be freaking out that Republican senators are going to [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=20.48s)]
*  vote against him on it because his tariff adventures are rating somewhere between lice [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=25.48s)]
*  and bedbugs in terms of their popularity with the American people. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=30.2s)]
*  And what Republican senator wouldn't want to distance him or herself from that? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=33.72s)]
*  He's threatening Republican senators that they better not vote against him on this, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=39.44s)]
*  not because the vote will matter, but because he's desperate to stop his own party from [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=43.32s)]
*  turning against him just 100 days in as he pursues a radically unpopular agenda and, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=49.0s)]
*  frankly, does so very poorly. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=55.2s)]
*  He's doing things that the American people hate the idea of, and then when he executes [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=57.440000000000005s)]
*  on those things, he fails. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=62.32s)]
*  Bad ideas done badly. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=65.68s)]
*  So, listen, here's where I think we are right now. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=69.12s)]
*  I think that Trump and the Trump administration are going to throw some increasingly wild [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=76.28s)]
*  pitches to try to change the political trajectory of how things are going. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=84.39999999999999s)]
*  I mean, they're now deporting U.S. citizens. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=89.28s)]
*  You can't deport a U.S. citizen. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=92.64s)]
*  U.S. citizens are from here. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=94.16s)]
*  There's nowhere to deport them to. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  They're now arresting judges, right? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=98.0s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=100.47999999999999s)]
*  I think that we should expect some wild pitches, some truly reckless actions, to try to change [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=101.44s)]
*  the trajectory of how things are going, to try to make it seem like this is a new game. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=108.39999999999999s)]
*  I think because of that instinct in Trump, we should expect that there are going to be [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=112.0s)]
*  some things ahead that are markedly more horrible than even what they have done already. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=116.32s)]
*  I think they're going to try to put some proverbial heads on bikes, and I think that's [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=120.64s)]
*  going to be terrible. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=124.0s)]
*  I also think, though, that the more important truth here is that the country is against [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=125.76s)]
*  them and the country is against him, and he knows it. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=131.84s)]
*  And the country is not only willing to get out and protest against him, they are willing [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=136.48s)]
*  to do it over and over and over and over and over and over again in every state in the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=140.48s)]
*  country and just about every town. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=146.95999999999998s)]
*  Culturally, it is now firmly established that capitulation and sucking up to Trump is shameful [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=150.39999999999998s)]
*  and weak and marks you as a loser. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=155.76s)]
*  Conversely, I think it is culturally ingrained now that saying no to Trump and fighting him [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=158.0s)]
*  and standing up to him shows that you are strong and a winner and somebody who other [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=164.0s)]
*  people might be interested in. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=167.6s)]
*  The super abundance of court rulings against Trump will continue. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=169.6s)]
*  I think that will help. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=173.11999999999998s)]
*  Bottom line, I think as long as the movement against him stays nonviolent, the movement [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=175.6s)]
*  against him wins. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=179.6s)]
*  I think Republicans and elected office at every level will face unrelenting and increasing [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=181.2s)]
*  pressure to split from Trump on his almost unbelievably unpopular policies. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=186.48s)]
*  Everything from tariffs to cutting Medicaid to what he's doing to Social Security to [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=193.2s)]
*  his treatment of Ukraine to medical research to Meals on Wheels to Head Start, all of it. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=199.84s)]
*  Republicans will be under unrelenting and increasing pressure to split from him on [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=204.95999999999998s)]
*  basically every policy with which he is associated. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=211.35999999999999s)]
*  And yes, that includes immigration. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=215.12s)]
*  And yes, that includes his abuse of trans people. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=216.95999999999998s)]
*  I think relentless opposition and mockery of his failures will spread and intensify [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  as those are further exposed and as nobody in any part of Republican politics finds any [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=226.08s)]
*  way to defend him. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=232.56s)]
*  I think emergency defense measures will increasingly spring up all over the country whenever he [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=234.32s)]
*  tries to pick anyone off, immigrants or otherwise. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=239.04000000000002s)]
*  I think 100 days in that Donald Trump is losing. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=242.8s)]
*  And I think Americans defending democracy are winning. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSJ9CCteT4U&t=245.92s)]
