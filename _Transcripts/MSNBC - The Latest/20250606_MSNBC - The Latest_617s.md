# 'This is part of the game': Trump cuts out Musk
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw)
*  It is day 138 of the second Trump administration, and Donald John Trump talked to several news [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=0.0s)]
*  outlets today because he wanted to make it absolutely clear just how much he is not thinking [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=6.44s)]
*  about his feud with Elon Musk. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  Today, Trump said Musk has lost his mind and he is not particularly interested in talking [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=14.08s)]
*  to him for quite a while. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=18.6s)]
*  And White House Chief of Staff Suzy Weil said that there are no plans for a call between [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=20.12s)]
*  the two men to simmer things down. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=24.48s)]
*  Meanwhile, Musk is still slamming Trump's spending bill on Twitter, saying that, quote, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=26.8s)]
*  Congress is bankrupting America. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=31.200000000000003s)]
*  Remember, the disagreement over the bill is how this whole thing started. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=33.52s)]
*  But while all of this is going on, we've got a very big reminder of just how much of an [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=38.0s)]
*  impact Elon Musk made during his time in Washington. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=42.68s)]
*  The Supreme Court has now allowed members of his Doge team, who are still there, to [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=46.32s)]
*  get access to sensitive data at the Social Security Administration. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=51.08s)]
*  That can include Social Security numbers, medical records, and tax and banking information [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=55.16s)]
*  of you and me. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=60.0s)]
*  Let's get started and bring in our nightcap. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  Brian Barrett joins us, executive editor of News for Wired. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=63.36s)]
*  Now you're a Huck, former White House senior director and former State Department senior [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=66.52s)]
*  advisor. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=70.03999999999999s)]
*  She's now an MSNBC columnist. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  And Stephen Kluvec, Democratic candidate for California governor and former CEO and chairman [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=72.75999999999999s)]
*  of Diamond Resorts International. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=77.19999999999999s)]
*  He's got a new book out this week, Facing Hard Truths, How Americans Can Get Real, Pull [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=79.0s)]
*  Together and Turn Our Country Around. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=84.4s)]
*  Michael Steele, let's start with you. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=87.88000000000001s)]
*  Trump, Michael Steele, I don't even see you there. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=89.92s)]
*  Trump is going to great lengths to show how much he does not care about Elon Musk. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=93.68s)]
*  I mean, the fact that he's even taking calls from news outlets just to say, no, no, no, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=100.80000000000001s)]
*  I don't like him. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=105.12s)]
*  I really don't like him. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=106.12s)]
*  I don't plan to talk to him soon. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=107.12s)]
*  What does that tell you? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=108.12s)]
*  Well, part of this is the game he plays. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=110.76s)]
*  So it's cat and mouse, right? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  It's like what he's done with the press. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=116.88000000000001s)]
*  It's like what he's done with other folks in his prior administration, where he gives [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=118.28s)]
*  them this rope and they go out and they play with the ball, right? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=122.92s)]
*  And they just play with the play. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=126.44s)]
*  And then at a certain point, he doesn't like the way they're playing with the ball. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=129.0s)]
*  And then he goes after them or they start to get some separation. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=133.4s)]
*  For Trump, this is part of the game that he plays. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=138.16s)]
*  The other part of it, though, is the consequences that come from it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=141.44s)]
*  And so at a certain point, it becomes a little bit more serious and a little bit more problematic. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=145.88s)]
*  Trump still is in the game. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=152.92s)]
*  But everybody else, whether you are one of our allies, whether you are a member of Congress, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=154.32s)]
*  whether you are a business leader, having to deal with, OK, which part of this game [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=158.96s)]
*  are we going to play? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=164.0s)]
*  What Elon Musk did was went toe to toe and turned that corner where probably something [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=165.51999999999998s)]
*  happened that Elon wanted, was promised or whatever, didn't get it. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=172.16s)]
*  And unlike others who were more afraid of Trump and what he may say or do on Twitter, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=177.64s)]
*  Elon was like, well, dude, I got 220 million followers. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=183.23999999999998s)]
*  So you want to play? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=186.56s)]
*  Let's play. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=189.0s)]
*  And so here we are. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=190.39999999999998s)]
*  Now, at the end of the day, will Trump capitulate? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=191.76s)]
*  Will Musk capitulate? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=195.0s)]
*  It's really not the point, because I think where they end up is exactly where they're [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=196.4s)]
*  always going to end up. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=201.0s)]
*  Musk got what he wanted, that is access to all of our data. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=202.64s)]
*  He has his he is in the sinews of government. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=207.12s)]
*  And Trump got what he wanted, 250 million dollars to get him elected, plus the cover [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=210.52s)]
*  Musk gave him to deconstruct the administrative state. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=216.16s)]
*  And so now the boys and girls in the playground are playing a little rough with each other. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=219.76s)]
*  That's the way it is. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=225.72s)]
*  And it'll continue to be that way. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=226.88s)]
*  These guys, these guys are just using each other to the extent that they can. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=228.35999999999999s)]
*  And we have to stop acting like this is something, this is novel or different. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=232.52s)]
*  No, this is their game. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=236.64s)]
*  And we are suffering the consequences of it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=238.56s)]
*  Not to mention all the investigations into Elon Musk's businesses, the regulations his [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=241.96s)]
*  businesses faced, the regulations have lightened up and those investigations poof, gone. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=247.28s)]
*  Steven, here's what's surprising to me, even with all of the Elon Musk's money. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=252.56s)]
*  I know we're only one day out, but at this point, it basically appears that all Republicans [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=257.12s)]
*  or Congress in Congress are standing by Trump, not Elon Musk. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=261.64s)]
*  Does that surprise you? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=265.88s)]
*  It doesn't. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=267.04s)]
*  It doesn't, because if you look at the ratings of Elon Musk and the ratings of Donald Trump, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=267.72s)]
*  Elon Musk has negative ratings. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=273.72s)]
*  He has absolutely demolished himself. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=276.72s)]
*  And he's, you'll see how much he's going to pay the price for it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=280.0s)]
*  I mean, stocks down substantially. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=283.32s)]
*  But look, we've been around politics and policy a long time. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=285.84s)]
*  And we've seen the Republican conundrum today is to stay with the one that's ahead right now. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=290.79999999999995s)]
*  And that is Donald Trump. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=299.52s)]
*  Brian, I want you to put into perspective the point Michael was just making. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=300.52s)]
*  How much has Elon Musk changed our government in just a few short months he was there? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=304.32s)]
*  In, I think, ways that are severe and lasting. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=312.4s)]
*  He's attempted to fire so many people. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=317.76s)]
*  There are some court cases that are working that out. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=320.4s)]
*  But the amount of brain drain that we've seen from the government, people who have lost [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=322.0s)]
*  their jobs, who aren't going to come back, jobs are offered back to them. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=326.6s)]
*  The amount of sort of dismantling the administrative state, as Michael said, all of these things [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=330.28000000000003s)]
*  are things that you can't sort of put back in the lamp. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=335.8s)]
*  The genie's out. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=339.2s)]
*  And Elon Musk opened it up. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=340.2s)]
*  And even though he says he stepped away, I think you have to remember whatever rift there [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=341.6s)]
*  is between Donald Trump and Elon Musk, the people from Doge are still there. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=345.36s)]
*  Doge is still actively recruiting. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=349.48s)]
*  We had a post today about how they are reaching out, offering huge government salaries or not [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=352.40000000000003s)]
*  very high on the government scale. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=357.48s)]
*  They're still expanding their operations. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=359.16s)]
*  They're part of government now. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=361.08s)]
*  It's indistinguishable. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=362.08s)]
*  Doge is the government and vice versa. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=363.08s)]
*  And I think that is sort of what this is striking from. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=365.44s)]
*  I need you to say this one more time to our audience. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=366.44s)]
*  Hold on a minute. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=368.12s)]
*  I need you to say this again because I think the average person out there assumes that [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=369.24s)]
*  Elon Musk has left Washington so Doge has shut down. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=373.76s)]
*  You're saying not only are they not shutting down, they're expanding? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=377.24s)]
*  Yeah, I think the way I put it in a recent story is trying to get Doge out of the government [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=380.88s)]
*  at this point is trying to remove a drop of food coloring from a glass of water. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=385.44s)]
*  It's just all the same thing at this point. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=390.59999999999997s)]
*  And I think you can see that too in the way that Russell Boat at OPM is sort of taking [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=393.15999999999997s)]
*  over Doge operations. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=397.91999999999996s)]
*  A lot of what Doge was doing in the first place lines up with what Project 2025 wanted [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=399.15999999999997s)]
*  to do. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=402.76s)]
*  It's a part of a larger project to shrink the government in a drastic scale. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=403.76s)]
*  And again, the people who came in at the beginning of Doge are largely still there and they're [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=409.76s)]
*  going to continue to be there. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=415.0s)]
*  And I think that's important to remember. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=416.8s)]
*  Whatever's happened at the fighting at the highest level, it's the people on the ground [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=419.36s)]
*  who are doing the work. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=423.52s)]
*  Now, you're a Elon Musk did not say much about Donald Trump today, but he had plenty to say [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=424.52s)]
*  about Steve Bannon. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=431.44s)]
*  Is that a warning of how we could see Republicans now split or the MAGA universe split? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=433.1s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=438.8s)]
*  This has been the concern for a while. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=440.72s)]
*  We just had a lot of really heavy, short fused male egos in key positions of power and trying [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=442.24s)]
*  to claim the mantle of the MAGA movement. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=449.16s)]
*  And it is not a movement that is intellectually aligned. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=451.24s)]
*  It's a movement that's been united behind Trump. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=454.64000000000004s)]
*  And for Trump, Elon Musk was somebody who had a lot of money. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=457.88s)]
*  Elon Musk separately believes that the United States and any government should be replaced [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=461.04s)]
*  by technology CEOs and fundamentally does not believe that there should be a government [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=466.12s)]
*  that provides public services. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=471.58s)]
*  It's interesting to see that that's the burning down of the administrative state was a very [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=473.46s)]
*  Steve Bannon type phrase. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=476.74s)]
*  And maybe this is his opportunity now that he had been moved out of the White House. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=479.46s)]
*  Trump had been upset that Steve Bannon got a Time magazine cover and Steve Bannon is [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=484.9s)]
*  now just off on radio. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=488.7s)]
*  This is now Steve Bannon's opportunity to try to get back in Trump's good graces. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=490.34s)]
*  I'm curious to see if that's something Elon ever decides to do because of all of the people [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=493.58s)]
*  who've had Trump falling out, even Marco Rubio, folks who've been insulted. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=497.5s)]
*  They have come back to try to get something from Trump. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=501.66s)]
*  Elon Musk doesn't necessarily need anything from Trump. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=504.14s)]
*  He got most of the tax credits for electronic vehicles under a Biden administration. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=506.98s)]
*  If anything, Elon Musk's reputation has been damaged by joining the Trump administration. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=510.66s)]
*  So this is probably the first male ego we've seen that can go toe to toe with Trump. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=515.38s)]
*  He already got everything he needed. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=522.46s)]
*  He's got all the money he could ever dream of. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=524.3s)]
*  He doesn't need to go back. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=526.66s)]
*  But I do want to remind everyone of how the president talked about Tesla over the last [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=527.66s)]
*  few months. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=533.98s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=534.98s)]
*  You got to give him credit. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=535.98s)]
*  We want the future to look like the future. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=537.98s)]
*  What kind of truck would Blade Runner drive? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=540.94s)]
*  The one I like is that one. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=543.34s)]
*  And I want that same color. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=546.14s)]
*  Will you buy a Tesla? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=547.14s)]
*  Will it boost Tesla sales and boost the stock? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=548.14s)]
*  Well, I hope it does. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=550.14s)]
*  Look, look. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=551.14s)]
*  Is that your goal by doing this? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=552.14s)]
*  I care about one thing. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=553.34s)]
*  When somebody's a great patriot, they shouldn't be hurt. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=555.1s)]
*  He's a great patriot. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=558.7800000000001s)]
*  I love Tesla. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=560.0600000000001s)]
*  He loves Tesla. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=561.0600000000001s)]
*  Well, now the New York Times says Donald Trump is looking to sell that red Tesla. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=562.0600000000001s)]
*  What gives, Michael? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=568.7s)]
*  Well, first off, it's Tesla, not Tesla. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=569.7s)]
*  So there's that. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=574.7s)]
*  A little technicality. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=575.7s)]
*  Look, you know, the front lawn of the White House is a showroom. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=576.7s)]
*  And at that moment, again, back to my earlier point, they were both getting something out [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=583.86s)]
*  of this. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=588.1s)]
*  And Trump knows and knew in that moment what he would say would help Tesla and his stock, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=589.1s)]
*  would help Elon. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=596.3000000000001s)]
*  And I think that's the key to the Tesla. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=613.1s)]
*  And I think that's the key to the Tesla. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=616.3000000000001s)]
*  And I think that's the key to the Tesla. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=619.3000000000001s)]
*  And I think that's the key to the Tesla. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=622.3000000000001s)]
*  And I think that's the key to the Tesla. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=625.3000000000001s)]
*  And I think that's the key to the Tesla. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=628.3000000000001s)]
*  And I think that's the key to the Tesla. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=631.3000000000001s)]
*  And I think that's the key to the Tesla. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=634.3000000000001s)]
*  And I think that's the key to the Tesla. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxNfa9CfJw&t=637.3000000000001s)]
