# 'Puzzled' and 'shocked': Harvard international student reacts to Trump threats
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg)
*  We are now joined by a Harvard PhD student from China who's about to graduate from Harvard. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=0.0s)]
*  Zeylan Ma, thank you so much for being with us. You graduate on Thursday, right? So this should be a [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=6.08s)]
*  celebratory moment. How are you feeling? I mean, definitely it feels less celebratory [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=13.36s)]
*  than I should feel. I feel a lot of uncertainty. I feel puzzled. I feel shocked. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=21.76s)]
*  To learn that, you know, because I'm a PhD student doing important research on how AI is transforming [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=28.4s)]
*  the workplace, this is something that White House has labeled as a national priority. So it's [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=36.72s)]
*  definitely disheartening and impossible to see the policy targeting the very people doing that work. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=42.08s)]
*  Right. Do you plan to stay in the U.S. to work after you graduate or have President Trump's actions [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=48.56s)]
*  caused you to alter your plans at all? So for now, I think until the hearing, my plan is to [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=55.44s)]
*  stay at the Harvard Business School to continue my research as a postdoc scholar with the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  DQ lab. But, you know, anything could happen in a hearing. And because of these uncertainties, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=70.64s)]
*  I definitely need to think about, you know, other ways to continue my research. And then, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=77.52s)]
*  you know, I've also heard about my friends, my colleagues, be it like, you know, U.S. citizen [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=84.8s)]
*  or not have been considering elsewhere to conduct their research or even moving out of the country. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=91.84s)]
*  What do you say to those who may be thinking right now, I don't care what happens to a few people at [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=99.28s)]
*  this super rich Ivy League school. Explain why they should care. Yeah, of course. I think first [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=104.48s)]
*  of all, it's not a few people. So this ban, attempted ban could be about, you know, over [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=112.16s)]
*  4000 unionized workers at Harvard. That includes the graduate students whose teaching, whose grading, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  whose answering students email to a.m. You know, we are the people who make the university work. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=128.4s)]
*  And it is also about this work visa called OPT, which is tied to the student visa. If the ban [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  exists, proceeds, then this work permit will be canceled. And everyone in the class of 2023, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=143.12s)]
*  2024, 2025 will be impacted. And these people have been currently working full time jobs [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=150.96s)]
*  at top companies doing the kind of technological, scientific and economic work that keeps American [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=157.6s)]
*  economy running. So as a, you know, as a brief statistics in the year of 2024, there has been, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=166.48s)]
*  you know, one point one million international students contributing to the U.S. economy. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=176.0s)]
*  So that is not a small number. That will be a big threat to these workers. That's such a great point. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=182.56s)]
*  And I know you've also pointed out previously that you think about the type of work that you and other [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=188.79999999999998s)]
*  students like yourself are doing who are also contributing to the workforce. As you point out, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=196.64s)]
*  and you had said, you know, the next breakthrough in A.I. work you're doing the next cancer cure, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=200.88s)]
*  the next Nobel Prize. If it doesn't happen here because you and others are kicked out of this [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=205.76s)]
*  country, it's going to happen elsewhere. That is America's loss. Now, part of the president's order [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=212.0s)]
*  targeting Harvard specifically claims the university coordinates with the Chinese Communist Party and [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=217.67999999999998s)]
*  Chinese nationals make up about a fifth of Harvard's foreign students. Do you and other [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  Chinese students feel like you're being targeted or scapegoated? Yeah, I definitely feel like we [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=228.88s)]
*  are being scapegoated. Like, you know, we have followed every rule. We have got the visa. We have [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=235.6s)]
*  passed all of the background checks. That was pretty, you know, thorough. And we have, you know, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=245.68s)]
*  as Chinese students, some of us work here, some of us, you know, pay tuition to get here. We paid a [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=255.6s)]
*  lot of things, taxes, like federal, state, sometimes even like, you know, social security [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=261.2s)]
*  that we may never benefit from. We have contributed a lot to US scientific research, education, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=265.84s)]
*  and economy. And yet we are currently the one facing uncertainty. So, you know, if the U.S. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=273.68s)]
*  is sending this kind of message to us Chinese international students that we're not welcome, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=279.52s)]
*  people will stop coming. And we actually have seen that people have dropped their interests by some [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=284.24s)]
*  polls that they will not come to the U.S. for studying and contributing to the scientific [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=288.72s)]
*  research. So if that happens, as you said, the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=294.32000000000005s)]
*  next cancer cure, or next Nobel Prize even, it will happen somewhere else. So I think it's really [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=299.76000000000005s)]
*  bigger than about immigration. It's about whether the U.S. wants to lead in science, tech, and [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=305.76000000000005s)]
*  education, or it wants to give it up. So we're not asking for any kind of special treatments. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=311.12s)]
*  We're simply asking to be treated equally, and we want to keep doing the work that benefits [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=318.47999999999996s)]
*  everybody. What's your message to other international students who may be considering [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=323.76s)]
*  or aspired to come and study here in the U.S.? Is it worth it? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=329.91999999999996s)]
*  I mean, looking back, I feel like it's still worth it. I've met many of my friends in here. I've [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=338.0s)]
*  met people from all over the world, and I have conducted important research with [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=346.88s)]
*  humanitarian negotiators. I've conducted important research with doctors and lawyers. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=355.04s)]
*  I have this education experience is what makes America great. And I think that people who are [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=362.08000000000004s)]
*  considering now is the time of uncertainty, but I think these things will pass eventually. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=369.6s)]
*  There were similar policies targeting us in the past, but it all went smoothly. Hopefully, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=378.24s)]
*  this time will still be the case. So my suggestion to my fellow, maybe Chinese students, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=386.24s)]
*  I think is be cautious, but still open to the idea of coming to the U.S. to experience this [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=393.2s)]
*  amazing education system. Well, thank you for sharing your thoughts with us and your experience. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=398.88s)]
*  Celine Ma, I appreciate your time and best of luck to you. Congratulations on your degree. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=404.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZ74ohe4bg&t=428.88s)]
