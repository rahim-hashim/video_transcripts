# RFK Jr. 'failed his first major test': Doctor slams handling of measles outbreak
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDGLFNBzseE)
*  Dr. Offit, the secretary did offer a preview of his defense of all these cuts at HHS in an interview in late March. Let's listen to that. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDGLFNBzseE&t=0.0s)]
*  What we're trying to do now is to streamline the agency, to eliminate the redundancies, and to focus the mission so that everybody who is at HHS is going to wake up every morning and say, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDGLFNBzseE&t=12.0s)]
*  what am I going to do today to make America healthy again? We're not cutting scientists. We're not cutting frontline workers. We're cutting administrators, and we're consolidating the agency. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDGLFNBzseE&t=26.0s)]
*  The department has slashed 20,000 jobs since January, he argues, frontline workers and scientists aren't being cut and that none of this impacts health care. Doctor, is that the case? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDGLFNBzseE&t=37.0s)]
*  Well, he's already had his first major test. And so you know how he's going to be doing in the future. He failed his first major test, which is this measles outbreak. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDGLFNBzseE&t=49.0s)]
*  So the CDC currently reports that there's about a thousand measles cases in this country. If you talk to people on the ground, that is off by a factor of at least three. It's at least 3000 cases. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDGLFNBzseE&t=59.0s)]
*  There have been three measles deaths in this country. That equals the total number of measles deaths over the last 25 years in this country. We've had two children die, both healthy little girls. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDGLFNBzseE&t=70.0s)]
*  That's the first child death from measles in more than 20 years. He's cut back the CDC in terms of surveillance. So we really don't know exactly what's going on. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDGLFNBzseE&t=82.0s)]
*  He's cut back the CDC in terms of their ability to have immunization clinics in areas that are at highest risk. So his response to this outbreak has largely been not only to ignore it, but to go on national television and say things that are outright lies like [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDGLFNBzseE&t=91.0s)]
*  measles vaccine kills people every year. Measles vaccine causes blindness and deafness. He does everything he can to frankly discourage measles vaccination during a measles epidemic that is killing people. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDGLFNBzseE&t=106.0s)]
*  That tells you about his ability. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDGLFNBzseE&t=118.0s)]
*  We will be listening closely for any questions that he gets on the measles outbreak, which as you point out has now reached over a thousand cases nationwide. And this was an issue he was questioned about pretty heavily when he was going through the confirmation process. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDGLFNBzseE&t=120.0s)]
*  The head of the Senate committee that he'll testify before this afternoon, Republican Bill Cassidy, a medical doctor, had urged him not to spread misinformation about the virus during that confirmation hearing. They seem to have come to some understanding. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDGLFNBzseE&t=135.0s)]
*  But what does that tell you about how Secretary Kennedy sees his role in this administration and whether he feels he should keep his word to these lawmakers? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDGLFNBzseE&t=150.0s)]
*  Well, he's already told you what he's going to do. He's told you that he is now going to have money to look at the relationship between autism and environmental factors. He has said autism is preventable. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDGLFNBzseE&t=163.0s)]
*  He has said that it's an environmental factor like a medicine. You know that he's going to soon and in a few months hold up a paper looking at a Medicaid data set and say, here, I knew this all along. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDGLFNBzseE&t=176.0s)]
*  Vaccines cause autism. And then he's going to alter the vaccine injury compensation program, just as Senator Elizabeth Warren warned and do everything he can to make vaccines less available, less affordable and more feared because he believes vaccines are not helpful and are just largely harmful. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDGLFNBzseE&t=188.0s)]
*  He's been saying that for 20 years. He's the same person. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDGLFNBzseE&t=206.0s)]
*  In addition to some of the misinformation, in addition to cutting positions, HHS has also cut research programs around the country on a slew of different topics and medical needs. Where does that leave us in the future? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDGLFNBzseE&t=209.0s)]
*  I think it leaves us less informed and at a greater risk. And not only that, he's cutting a lot of the programs that he says he's interested in, you know, like diabetes research, for example, Alzheimer's research. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDGLFNBzseE&t=224.0s)]
*  I mean, he talks about chronic disease as being important to him, yet he cuts programs that are looking at the cause or causes of those chronic diseases. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDGLFNBzseE&t=235.0s)]
*  He also ignores the 20 years of research on autism and proceeds to say it's a preventable disease when all the evidence is that for the most part you're likely born with autism because he has his own fixed immutable beliefs that he is now going to sort of take data and shoehorn it into that belief. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDGLFNBzseE&t=244.0s)]
*  I sense you're frustrated. I sense you are worried. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDGLFNBzseE&t=260.0s)]
*  That understates it. I think we have a head of health and human services who is going to make us less healthy. And as a pediatrician, it's really hard to watch this. I was talking to a pediatrician the other day and she says it's never been harder for me. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDGLFNBzseE&t=266.0s)]
*  There's always been sort of anti-vaccine notion among some patients, but now they feel more emboldened than ever before because they have somebody who's the head of HHS who basically supports their point of view. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDGLFNBzseE&t=280.0s)]
*  Before I let you go quickly, Dr. Offit, earlier this week, Secretary Kennedy posted a picture of himself swimming in a creek with high levels of bacteria. This is in Washington, D.C. What do you make of that? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDGLFNBzseE&t=292.0s)]
*  Well, if you look at his book, The Real Anthony Fauci, he says he doesn't believe in the germ theory. The specific germs cause specific diseases. So if you don't believe that, then I guess you can go swimming in an area that's loaded with bacteria. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDGLFNBzseE&t=306.0s)]
*  Dr. Paul Offit, I always appreciate your guidance and expertise. Thank you for joining us and sharing your thoughts on all these matters. Appreciate it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDGLFNBzseE&t=317.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDGLFNBzseE&t=326.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDGLFNBzseE&t=347.0s)]
