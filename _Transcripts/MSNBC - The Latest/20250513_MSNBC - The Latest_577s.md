# Gift or grift? Typical Trump allies break with plan to accept $400M jet from Qatar
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg)
*  OK, joining us now, NBC's Julie Serkin reporting on Capitol Hill, NBC, I'm sorry, New York [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=0.0s)]
*  Times reporter Charlie Savage and Elyse Jordan, former aide to President George W. Bush in [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  the White House and State Department and an MSNBC political analyst. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=11.56s)]
*  Julie, every time I see that clip, I laugh right along. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=15.64s)]
*  But the question seems to be gift or grift. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=19.12s)]
*  What are you hearing from Republicans? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  I think Republicans are trying to figure that out themselves. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=25.12s)]
*  A lot of them are having this news broken to them by us yesterday. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=28.1s)]
*  That was certainly Cynthia Lummis's position there, who found out about it for the first [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=31.42s)]
*  time from us. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=35.300000000000004s)]
*  We've been talking to Republicans all day long about this, asking them specific questions. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=36.3s)]
*  How would they feel if, let's say, President Biden was accepting a $400 million gift from [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=40.44s)]
*  a foreign government? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=44.46s)]
*  How would they feel, for example, if the president used it during his time in office, if he plans [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=45.72s)]
*  to use it after, if he plans to park it at a museum? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=49.82s)]
*  There are so many questions to ask about this, including whether taxpayers will be on the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=52.540000000000006s)]
*  hook, as Ryan just alluded to. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=56.06s)]
*  Of course, they would need more money to be able to sweep it, take it apart, put it back [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=57.78s)]
*  together. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=61.14s)]
*  I want you to take a listen to a little bit of a mash and we'll dig in more on the other [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=62.14s)]
*  side. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=65.06s)]
*  It's a nice gesture, but I think maybe the thing to do is to say, hey, we appreciate [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=66.06s)]
*  it, but there's a lot of other things you could help us out with. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=72.02000000000001s)]
*  I got no problem with that. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=74.14s)]
*  I mean, it's made in America, made by Boeing. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=75.14s)]
*  I don't think that President Trump, he doesn't need a bribe. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=79.34s)]
*  You got to work through the cost benefit of it, right? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=83.42s)]
*  I mean, we're in a world of doge, so we got to figure out whether it's worth upfitting [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=85.61999999999999s)]
*  or writing a check to settlement and writing a check to the Treasury and help us with our [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=89.82s)]
*  debt reduction. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=93.53999999999999s)]
*  Senator Kevin Kramer told me, what's the difference? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=95.13999999999999s)]
*  We have a Statue of Liberty from France. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=97.61999999999999s)]
*  I actually asked him what his reaction would be. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=99.61999999999999s)]
*  If this were Biden, he said, well, I look up at that TV and I see a vibrant celebrity [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=102.33999999999999s)]
*  who's engaged in, quote, adult conversations on the world stage. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=106.89999999999999s)]
*  So he doesn't think this is comparable to Biden, who he said, in his words, was not [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=109.97999999999999s)]
*  active. I do think this is something that's going to be a big deal. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=114.06s)]
*  It's something, though, that Republicans maybe publicly are playing off, but privately [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=115.46s)]
*  are concerned about. I talked to one Senate Republican just a few minutes ago before I [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=119.5s)]
*  came on your show, Chris, who raised forget about the emoluments clause, which, of course, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=123.33999999999999s)]
*  requires congressional approval for the president to be able to accept any foreign gifts. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=126.82s)]
*  There might be laws in place and there are laws in place for what kind of vehicle, the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=130.42s)]
*  mode of transportation the president uses since he is planning to use this at some point [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=135.01999999999998s)]
*  in office, according to his own words. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=139.14s)]
*  Can he even do it? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=140.85999999999999s)]
*  This senator thinks this is a lot of talk right now, but it's an issue that's going to go [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=142.42000000000002s)]
*  away. We'll see. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=145.86s)]
*  Yeah. And Charlie, you wrote about something a lot of people are talking about, the ethical [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=147.14000000000001s)]
*  alarms. And you say that compared to Trump's first term, they seem trivial [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=150.62s)]
*  compared to this. So set the stage for us as President Trump actually is preparing to [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=156.26000000000002s)]
*  go from Saudi Arabia, where he is right now, to Qatar. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=160.66s)]
*  Yes, this is this plain controversy is just really the latest in a series of ways in [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=165.3s)]
*  which the second Trump administration has really unleashed a no holds barred aggression [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=171.46s)]
*  in terms of mixing private gain for the Trump family and people and entities in Trump's [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=178.34s)]
*  orbit with his public office. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=184.14000000000001s)]
*  There was the unbelievably large amount of money they raised for their inauguration [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=186.54000000000002s)]
*  festivities, a quarter of a billion dollars. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=192.3s)]
*  There's no way they spent anywhere near that on a few events and dinners. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=194.58s)]
*  What's going to happen to the rest of that money? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=198.74s)]
*  They have this cryptocurrency venture where they started a meme coin and crypto investors [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=200.82s)]
*  around the world can enrich Trump just by trading that coin. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=207.1s)]
*  He gets fees and now he's auctioning off face to face access to himself and a White [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=209.86s)]
*  House tour for the largest holders of that cryptocurrency, which further spurs interest [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=215.34s)]
*  in this buying these coins that are worth billions of dollars to him, at least on paper [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=220.98s)]
*  for now. And his sons have been ahead of this trip in the Middle East. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=225.98s)]
*  We're running around the Middle East, striking off billions of dollars worth of business [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=229.45999999999998s)]
*  deals for new golf courses and buildings and resorts and towers with various Middle East [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=233.45999999999998s)]
*  entities. Obviously something that would be of greater interest to powerful rich people [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=239.45999999999998s)]
*  in the Middle East because of the president. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=245.82s)]
*  To say nothing of a new five hundred thousand dollar a member club that Donald Trump [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=248.06s)]
*  Jr. and his business partners are starting in Washington, D.C. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=253.77999999999997s)]
*  And so this free plane comes on the heels of this enormous pattern. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=257.62s)]
*  I've just mentioned a few of them. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=262.26s)]
*  We could keep going for minutes and minutes, but this is TV. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=263.82s)]
*  So I won't. That's really crystallizing that this is the limits of [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=266.14s)]
*  propriety, whatever the law or ethics or whatever that we thought governed public service [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=271.7s)]
*  or even the concerns that people had about people buying meals and booking hotel rooms in [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=277.18s)]
*  the first term are just nothing compared to this orgy that we're seeing right now. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=281.74s)]
*  And just take one of them, at least four hundred million dollars for the plane. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=287.02s)]
*  And Charlie reports on this in The Times today, the administration, though they signed off [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=290.42s)]
*  on it, they haven't made public their analysis why they think that this is OK. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=295.3s)]
*  And we should also say that Pam Bondi was a highly paid lobbyist. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=301.62s)]
*  Well, exactly as Charlie wrote in his excellent article, this is so ethically dubious, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=305.02s)]
*  wrong. I mean, it's just wrong. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=311.9s)]
*  This, you know, idea beyond dubious. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=313.78s)]
*  Absolutely beyond. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=316.14s)]
*  I mean, I was I was too tempered. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=317.65999999999997s)]
*  It's completely wrong. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=319.26s)]
*  But it also is just stupid. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=320.7s)]
*  Why are we taking a plane that we would have to completely retrofit? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=322.9s)]
*  And it doesn't even have the refueling capacity to take the president of the United States [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=326.62s)]
*  so the president can be in the airspace for an unlimited amount of time. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=331.18s)]
*  It's just not practical. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=335.3s)]
*  It makes no sense. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=336.62s)]
*  They would have to go through every inch. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=337.78s)]
*  Question for you. Let's say that they come to the conclusion. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=339.38s)]
*  It's not practical. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=342.90000000000003s)]
*  It's too costly. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=344.18s)]
*  But it's a gift that Donald Trump could use after he leaves office. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=345.74s)]
*  Well, what I'm wondering about is the fact that Donald Trump is willing to make this [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=350.02000000000004s)]
*  the news focus right now. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=355.02000000000004s)]
*  What are we missing about what's happening with these trips? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=356.58000000000004s)]
*  What is the purpose of Saudis? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=359.90000000000003s)]
*  The Emiratis cutter this week? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=362.18s)]
*  Is there something else going on that's bigger than just a horribly, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=364.46000000000004s)]
*  ethically wrong gift? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=369.98s)]
*  There is so much more to this story. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=371.62s)]
*  Well, let me play the legal concerns and security concerns, right? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=373.54s)]
*  Security concerns raised by Senator Rick Scott today. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=378.54s)]
*  Let me play that. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=380.82s)]
*  Cutters is not, in my opinion, a great ally. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=383.54s)]
*  I mean, they support Hamas. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=386.26s)]
*  And so what I'm worried about is the safety of the president of the United States. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=387.5s)]
*  Do you have any idea how much it would cost to sweep the plane and ensure there are no [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=390.78000000000003s)]
*  listening devices? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=394.26s)]
*  I don't know how you would be able to do that if you don't, you know, if you don't build [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=395.54s)]
*  it from scratch. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=398.3s)]
*  Talk a little bit about the security protocols involved in something like this. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=400.02s)]
*  Think of every it's the command control center for the president. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=403.58s)]
*  Think of all the technology. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=407.94s)]
*  Think about how the wings have to be every inch. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=409.78000000000003s)]
*  It couldn't. What if the plane was designed to crash? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=413.62s)]
*  There are so many what ifs and possibilities. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=417.02s)]
*  You can't just send the president of the United States up on any random aircraft. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=419.5s)]
*  And you certainly don't. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=424.41999999999996s)]
*  It's going to take years. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=426.26s)]
*  I understand he's upset about Boeing being so behind five years or so behind on the new [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=427.34s)]
*  Air Force One. But why not just kick Boeing and say, get the plane done? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=432.85999999999996s)]
*  We can't even today. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=437.94s)]
*  It's baffling that we can't even get an Air Force One finished. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=439.21999999999997s)]
*  And how would we deal with what America did for World War Two and manufacturing and [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=443.09999999999997s)]
*  getting that war machine ready? It's pretty abysmal. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=448.26s)]
*  So I guess the question, Charlie, is after the Supreme Court granted immunity to Trump [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=450.94s)]
*  essentially for actions as president of the United States, and he clearly thinks all of [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=455.9s)]
*  this is covered by it or is certainly not concerned about it. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=460.58s)]
*  In fact, he said it would be stupid not to take the plane. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=464.82s)]
*  It begs the question, where does this end or with whom or what? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=468.21999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I think Trump is clearly emboldened by the Supreme Court's ruling, granting him [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=472.98s)]
*  immunity for official actions last year. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=476.86s)]
*  And it also even before Trump in 2016, there was a famous case where the Supreme Court [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=479.22s)]
*  narrowed what counts as an official act for the purpose of bribing public officials in a [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=484.58000000000004s)]
*  case involving eliminating the conviction of the Virginia governor, Bob McDonald, for [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=489.34000000000003s)]
*  corruption charges. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=496.14s)]
*  And so it's just the legal parameters and guardrails around bribery are are much diminished [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=497.7s)]
*  today. And that's the climate in which this is operating. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=504.42s)]
*  I do have to say, I think the people talking about emoluments, so we saw Senator Schumer [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=507.74s)]
*  there on a clip ahead of this, maybe a little bit off because as I understand it, this plane [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=512.26s)]
*  would go to the Department of Defense, not to Trump personally. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=517.02s)]
*  I think that the bigger legal issue is his plan to transfer it to his museum foundation in [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=520.26s)]
*  twenty twenty nine. It's just not clear to me why that would be in the public interest. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=525.02s)]
*  And that's where it gets much closer to being a toy for him to use for the rest of his life. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=529.94s)]
*  Charlie Savage, Julie Serkin, Elise Jordan, thank you. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=534.98s)]
*  Be sure to watch Elise Jordan every Saturday and Sunday, six to nine p.m. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=538.06s)]
*  Eastern. She's the co-host of the new panel show The Weekend Primetime. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=542.14s)]
*  We were discussing the fact that she either has the pleasure or the challenge of sitting next to [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=546.02s)]
*  the two best dressed. I know, right. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=551.66s)]
*  It was a lot of pressure, but I think hopefully I passed the test. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbH4P8lnDCg&t=553.9s)]
