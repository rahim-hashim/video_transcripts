# 'Abuse of power' is 'very concerning': NJ lawmaker speaks out about Trump admin arrest threats
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo)
*  Meanwhile, the Trump administration now threatening the arrests of three Democratic members of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=0.0s)]
*  Congress. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Here was DHS spokeswoman Trisha McLaughlin. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  You say a video of members of Congress body slamming ICE officials? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=15.96s)]
*  That's correct, sir. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=16.96s)]
*  It's disgusting. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=17.96s)]
*  OK. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=18.96s)]
*  And so if you have that video, are you suggesting that members of Congress will be arrested [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=19.96s)]
*  who were there yesterday? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=25.6s)]
*  This is an ongoing investigation and that is definitely on the table. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=27.32s)]
*  OK. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  Those comments are after New Jersey's Bonnie Watson Coleman, Robin Endez and LaMonica McIver [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  confronted ICE agents when they visited a Newark ICE facility Friday to conduct congressional [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=37.0s)]
*  oversight. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=42.56s)]
*  The lawmakers denied DHS accusations of violence. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=43.56s)]
*  Federal officials did arrest Newark Mayor Roz Baraka, who was also at the facility. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=47.04s)]
*  They arrested him for trespassing. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=52.32s)]
*  He was released hours later. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=54.08s)]
*  And joining us now is one of those lawmakers, New Jersey Democratic Congresswoman Bonnie [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=56.04s)]
*  Watson Coleman. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=60.96s)]
*  Thank you so much, Congresswoman. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=61.96s)]
*  I know you've been waiting for us for a bit. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=63.32s)]
*  Really appreciate your patience. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=65.56s)]
*  Trump officials have threatened you with arrest. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=67.16s)]
*  The DHS spokeswoman just said you and fellow lawmakers assaulted ICE agents. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=70.28s)]
*  Before you respond, let me play more of the video of this incident. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=75.16s)]
*  Walk us through what we're seeing here and what's your response to ICE's characterization [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=86.04s)]
*  of this incident? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=95.12s)]
*  Well, it's obvious that none of the members of Congress were body slamming or assaulting [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=96.12s)]
*  any of the officers. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=105.68s)]
*  It was a multiple number of officers with their masks on and with their guns in their [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=107.84s)]
*  taking the mayor away. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=114.96s)]
*  We were trying to shield the mayor. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=117.19999999999999s)]
*  The mayor was not trespassing. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=118.72s)]
*  The mayor had never argued with any of the ICE agents about being inside of the property [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=121.0s)]
*  when he was invited to come in and speak for a moment to some of them. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=128.16s)]
*  When they told him he was trespassing, they told him that in our presence, and he turned [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=132.56s)]
*  around and went behind the fence into the public property. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=137.72s)]
*  And so what you're seeing is the chaos when all of the officers decided that they were [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=142.23999999999998s)]
*  going to just sort of hugely escort the mayor into the facility to arrest him for what we [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=147.76s)]
*  didn't know. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=159.44s)]
*  And we kept asking him, for what, for what, for what? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=160.44s)]
*  And so, of course, we were trying to shield him because we saw this as an abuse of power. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=162.94s)]
*  We know that there's a reason to be afraid of ICE. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=168.28s)]
*  We know that there's abuse taking place with other citizens in this country. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=171.06s)]
*  And our instinct was to protect him. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=178.3s)]
*  Are you afraid of potential arrest yourself? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=180.78s)]
*  Let me just say I'm not afraid. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=185.3s)]
*  I am concerned that the abuse of power that we're seeing coming out of this administration [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=186.86s)]
*  and the lying that takes place is very concerning to us. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=192.54s)]
*  So we don't know what to expect. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=197.18s)]
*  This is about retribution, and this is about intimidation. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=200.73999999999998s)]
*  And if they can intimidate Congress members, they can intimidate individuals who are just [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=205.29999999999998s)]
*  walking the streets, going to school, going to work, living with their families. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=209.98s)]
*  And I'm not going to be intimidated, nor will my colleagues be intimidated. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=215.94s)]
*  And, Ana, we won't be lied on. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=221.29999999999998s)]
*  We will not be lied on. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=223.54s)]
*  This administration lies from the president on down to the folks on the ground. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=225.5s)]
*  And we're just not going to stand for it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=230.7s)]
*  We're going to stand up to it. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=233.1s)]
*  New Jersey Congresswoman Bonnie Watson-Coleman, thank you. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=234.82s)]
*  And I know you have to bounce, but I hope you'll come back and continue the conversation [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=237.54s)]
*  another day. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=241.78s)]
*  Appreciate your time. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=242.78s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=243.78s)]
*  Thank you, Ana. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO4iJUz3jfo&t=244.78s)]
