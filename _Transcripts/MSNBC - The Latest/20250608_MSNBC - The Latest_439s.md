# Inside Trump’s idea of a ‘revolution’: ICE agents and protestors clash in Los Angeles
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ)
*  We're continuing our coverage of breaking news out of Los Angeles. Mayor Karen Bass [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=0.0s)]
*  said the National Guard has not yet been deployed in the city after protesters clashed with [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=5.64s)]
*  law enforcement over immigration raids carried out by the Trump administration. Her statement [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=12.0s)]
*  comes after President Trump signed a memorandum deploying, quote, 2000 National Guardsmen [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=17.64s)]
*  to address the lawlessness. And federal officials told the New York Times that troops will arrive [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=23.48s)]
*  in L.A. County within the next 24 hours. Max Boot and Anthony Coley are back with us and [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=30.3s)]
*  also joining the conversation. Anne Applebaum, staff writer at The Atlantic and author of [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=36.4s)]
*  Autocracy, Inc., the dictators who want to run the world. Anne, thank you for being with [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=41.86s)]
*  us this morning. Would love to just get your your overall thoughts here about not the specifics [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=47.74s)]
*  of what's happening in Los Angeles, but the conversation we've been having since the beginning [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=55.94s)]
*  of this show. And I think Max was pointing this out just before we went to break the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=59.9s)]
*  concern about the administration looking for excuses to escalate the situation and then [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=64.94s)]
*  do do even more than what it's doing. Could you talk about that concern and how that plays [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=72.06s)]
*  into your knowledge and your expertise on what authoritarians do, what autocrats do [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=79.18s)]
*  in situations like this? I think that's a great way to start thinking about it, because [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=85.62s)]
*  if you take a step back and if you look at what Trump and especially some of the people [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=91.58s)]
*  around Trump have been trying to do since winning the election, they've been trying [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=96.14s)]
*  they've been carrying out what they think of as a revolution. They use revolutionary [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=101.02000000000001s)]
*  language. They talk about an assault on the administrative state. They used Elon Musk [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=104.78s)]
*  and his team of engineers to go into federal departments and to government departments [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=110.42s)]
*  to take over computer systems, to fire people en masse. They're trying to create a major [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=115.98s)]
*  change and their change is beginning to run into stumbling blocks, just like happens in [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=121.18s)]
*  all revolutions. And much of what they did turns out to have been against the law. Courts [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=126.22s)]
*  are beginning to push back on them. The public doesn't like what they're doing. Trump's tariffs [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=131.54s)]
*  are unpopular. And when you are in a situation like that, when you're running what you think [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=135.96s)]
*  of as a revolution, you often feel the need to escalate, to move to the next stage. How [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=140.72s)]
*  can you suspend the law? How can you change the rules again? How can you create a situation [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=147.20000000000002s)]
*  of emergency that allows you to do whatever it is that you want to do more quickly? And [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  what worries me about what we're seeing is it looks like this is the moment they've chosen [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=158.68s)]
*  to try to escalate. A lot of what Trump has done since January has also been an attempt to go [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=163.52s)]
*  around the law, to ignore the law, to use a kind of fake emergency in order to impose tariffs and [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=170.36s)]
*  a fake emergency in order to deport people to El Salvador. This is another attempt to create a [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  sense of emergency, the impression of emergency, so that the law can be broken. And that's what I [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=182.60000000000002s)]
*  hope people keep their eye focused on over the next few days. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=188.56s)]
*  And in that vein, it is the first time since 1965 that a president has activated a state's [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=192.76s)]
*  National Guard without a request from the state's governor. You have, that's from the Brennan Center [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=198.72s)]
*  of Justice, you have the governor of California saying, this is an escalation, it's unnecessary, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=203.44s)]
*  called deranged behavior. What is, how does that play into it? We have the, you know, the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=211.0s)]
*  leader of the nation taking over something that the governor did not ask for. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=216.96s)]
*  I mean, look, it's against the very principles that the Republican Party used to stand for. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=223.28s)]
*  They were believers in small government, in state rights, in decisions being made at the lowest [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=228.88s)]
*  level possible. This is not only a violation of at least the norms of the Constitution, if not the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=235.4s)]
*  law, and as well as the ideas of the people who make up what's currently the largest political [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=243.92s)]
*  party in America. So again, it's Trump seeking to overcome tradition, to destroy, or at least to [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=251.32s)]
*  undermine the rule of law in order to leave himself more space to maneuver. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=258.12s)]
*  And the question I would ask is, what is he going to do with this emergency situation? Why does he [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=263.56s)]
*  need this emergency? What is it that he wants to achieve with the suspension of law, starting in [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=268.88000000000005s)]
*  California and maybe moving to other places? And as your guests have been saying for the last several [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=275.20000000000005s)]
*  minutes, you know, we're not talking about mass demonstrations or violence. We're talking about a [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=280.0s)]
*  few hundred people in L.A. So this is a constructed and engineered emergency. And what everyone should [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=284.8s)]
*  be focused on is why are they doing it and what are they going to use it for? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=292.48s)]
*  Max, it really is something that Pete Hegseth jumped from National Guard to Marines at Camp Pendleton. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=298.88000000000005s)]
*  Right. This is not what you want in a situation like this. A trigger-happy Secretary of Defense. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=308.32000000000005s)]
*  Now, I think to you know, one thing you can say in favor of the Trump administration is I don't think [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=314.8s)]
*  that they are looking for wars overseas. They're not necessarily looking to involve U.S. forces in [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=321.04s)]
*  conflict with Iran or other bad actors, but it does seem like they're looking for wars at home. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=325.44s)]
*  They're looking for confrontations at home. And you know, this is very convenient for somebody [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=333.2s)]
*  like Pete Hegseth, who's had a bad first few months on the job, where you know, he was involved in [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=338.48s)]
*  the Signalgate scandal, where he was texting U.S. attack plans to the editor of The Atlantic, as [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=344.32s)]
*  well as to a lot of his colleagues in the government on an unsecured app. He's had massive [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=353.12s)]
*  turmoil in the Secretary of Defense office, people coming and going. He's been focused on [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=358.16s)]
*  culture wars, not on really preparing America for actual wars against actual adversaries. And [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=365.44s)]
*  from what we read, he has not been in good odor in the White House, that President Trump has not [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=372.24s)]
*  been happy with a lot of the stuff that he's doing, including when he wanted to give Elon Musk [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=377.36s)]
*  access to U.S. war plans involving China. And so this is an opportunity for him to get in Trump's [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=382.64s)]
*  good graces, to be on the same page as the White House and say, yeah, you're sending a National [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=388.56s)]
*  Guard, I'm going to send in Marines. It's completely inappropriate. It's very, very dangerous, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=393.76s)]
*  because you should not be having active duty U.S. troops involved in missions on U.S. soil, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=397.68s)]
*  barring some catastrophe, which has not happened here. And I think this is the key point. You're [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=405.44s)]
*  talking about dozens or hundreds of demonstrators. There is nothing that remotely [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=409.84s)]
*  would justify the deployment of active duty Marines to Los Angeles. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrpIY7vwCxQ&t=414.0s)]
