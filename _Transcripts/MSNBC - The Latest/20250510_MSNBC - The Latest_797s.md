Video Description: Trump’s remarks about Americans needing to purchase less dolls to fix an economic crisis he manufactured is “condescending,” says fmr. California Rep. Katie Porter, a single mom of three. The dismissive rhetoric is aimed at prepping Americans for austerity, a drastic measure typically reserved for real national emergencies. But in this case, Trump created the problem to justify tax breaks for the wealthy. “This is not a man who's going to be pushing a shopping cart with three kids in tow through a Target or a Walmart in August, when his tariffs are in full effect,” says Porter. “For him to talk this way to the American people is so dismissive of working people– and of what it's really like to be an American, while he sits [in] a gold-gilded office.”

# Trump’s dismissive ‘doll’ talk is ‘gross’ and trivializes tariff pain for working families
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw)
*  Start this hour with what Donald Trump is trying to sell the American people this second term [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=0.0s)]
*  the president has brought up the hardship that Americans will face multiple times now as the chaotic rollout of his tariffs have proven both [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=5.54s)]
*  damaging to the American economy and [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  wildly unpopular among the American people [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=15.92s)]
*  Like his recent remark that American children might have two dolls instead of 30 this Christmas [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=19.14s)]
*  He's perhaps using dolls as an example here because it sounds frivolous and unimportant in the grand scheme of things [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=24.1s)]
*  but make no mistake what the president is trying to sell here has nothing to do with dolls and [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=30.3s)]
*  everything to do with the concept of [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=36.94s)]
*  austerity and that is not what he campaigned on [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=39.7s)]
*  For ordinary American families who work hard for every penny reducing financial hardship to a question of dolls is deeply offensive [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=43.22s)]
*  It's a dismissal of the daily struggle to make ends meet in a country where the cost of living living keeps outpacing wages [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=50.62s)]
*  His sweeping tariffs could cost the average household [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=57.94s)]
*  $3,800 a year hitting working and middle-class Americans the hardest according to a report from Yale [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=62.339999999999996s)]
*  When Trump talks about dolls what he's really saying is get ready for hard times [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=68.34s)]
*  Prepare for scarcity prepare for prices to spike you probably won't be able to afford the life that you currently live [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=73.1s)]
*  and why for what [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=80.66000000000001s)]
*  To bankroll his tariff and tax cuts for the riches [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=83.06s)]
*  Why Trump a man who surrounds himself with gold-plated everything is trivializing what amounts to a demand for real sacrifice? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=86.02000000000001s)]
*  from working and middle-class Americans [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=93.06s)]
*  Make no mistake. This is not about dolls or pencils or strollers [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=96.26s)]
*  It's about deliberately making life harder for millions of families under the false pretense that doing so is necessary [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=102.7s)]
*  For some greater good, but there is no greater good [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=109.69999999999999s)]
*  Unless you're pretty rich and even then it's not clear that tanking the global economy is beneficial because Donald Trump's tariffs [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=112.94s)]
*  Don't just take a wrecking ball to Main Street America [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=119.22s)]
*  They put the US dollars global dominance at serious risk of collapse [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=122.97999999999999s)]
*  That's according to the Harvard economist Ken Rogoff who told Axios quote Trump is a catalyst and an accelerant [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=127.06s)]
*  The rest of the world was already seeking more freedom from the dollar and this just lit a fire under it end quote [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=135.02s)]
*  America does not need austerity right now for any reason [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=142.34s)]
*  We certainly don't need austerity austerity so that the ultra wealthy can score another five trillion dollars in tax cuts [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=146.1s)]
*  We don't need austerity so Trump can pass a cruel budget that guts Medicaid and dismantles the social safety net all to fund [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=152.66s)]
*  $5 trillion in tax cuts [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=160.57999999999998s)]
*  Remember after 9-eleven president George W. Bush told Americans that the most patriotic thing they could do was spend [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=163.18s)]
*  To keep the economy moving that was a Republican president encouraging consumer confidence and spending not austerity [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=169.78s)]
*  And that was a moment of real national crisis [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=176.3s)]
*  Because George Bush understood what every president except this president does that in America consumer spending drives economic recovery [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=179.86s)]
*  But now we got a Republican president who himself caused the instability from which we would actually need to recover and he's asking ordinary [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=188.38000000000002s)]
*  Non-rich working Americans to tighten their belts to fix it [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=196.5s)]
*  Let's be clear [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=201.34s)]
*  Austerity is a real thing that has historically in some very specific instances been used successfully [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=203.26000000000002s)]
*  But it's certainly not a growth strategy, which is what Donald Trump actually campaigned on [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=209.06s)]
*  Austerity is the policy of pulling back two dolls instead of 35 pencils instead of 250 [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=214.94s)]
*  though I've never known anyone who wasn't an architect who had 250 pencils and [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=220.7s)]
*  Like tariffs austerity only makes sense in certain specific circumstances for instance during a true emergency like a war [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=225.22s)]
*  or natural disaster [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=233.06s)]
*  Austerity asks people to sacrifice for the greater good, but what is the greater good here? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=235.57999999999998s)]
*  To what true national emergency are we responding other than the one that Donald Trump is [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=241.14000000000001s)]
*  Manufacturing through sweeping tariffs that raise prices on everything from groceries to school supplies [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=246.62s)]
*  This is in fact [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=252.46s)]
*  austerity without us without justification austerity with no purpose [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=254.46s)]
*  It's austerity by design to make sure that the wealthy remain untouched while the rest of the country is told to make do [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=258.66s)]
*  Because let's be honest Trump never intended for the wealthy to share in this so-called sacrifice [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=265.54s)]
*  When Trump says your kids only need two dolls. He's not saying his grandkids will get two gifts this holiday season [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=271.74s)]
*  He's not telling billionaire CEOs. They should give up their private jets and fly commercial or sell their yachts and board a Carnival cruise [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=279.3s)]
*  He's telling you [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=286.58000000000004s)]
*  The teacher the truck driver the retiree the single mom the small business owner [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=288.26s)]
*  He's telling you your life needs to get economically smaller [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=293.21999999999997s)]
*  so his billionaire buddies tax bills can get smaller and [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=297.65999999999997s)]
*  While he's at it his foot soldiers in Congress are busy pushing cuts to Medicaid the very lifeline that families depend on when times get tough [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=301.94s)]
*  So he manufactures this crisis [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=309.09999999999997s)]
*  He imposes austerity and then he takes away the very tools that Americans need to survive it [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=311.53999999999996s)]
*  This is a betrayal of trust not just of his base [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=318.62s)]
*  But of all hard-working Americans and a full-blown assault on America's working in middle class [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=321.26s)]
*  You know the 99 percent who don't have Mar-a-Lago and Trump towers to fall back on [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=326.62s)]
*  This is not economic policy. It's a wealth protection racket dressed up as fiscal responsibility [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=332.65999999999997s)]
*  Even the conservative Wall Street Journal sees right through it writing quote in mr [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=338.74s)]
*  Trump's America you get two dolls only you pay more and you be sure to thank the man in the handmade silk tie on the way out [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=343.28000000000003s)]
*  Presidents succeed by promising a chicken in every pot and then delivering two or three [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=350.88000000000005s)]
*  Up until last week. I would have said that was mr. Trump shtick now. I'm not so sure mr [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=355.48s)]
*  Trump has no standing to push austerity his whole life has been a tribute to gilded gaudy excess every room [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=360.42s)]
*  He enters is bedazzled and bedet [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=367.44000000000005s)]
*  He puts his name on anything he thinks he can sell sneakers watches stakes golf balls [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=369.92s)]
*  Nobody needs any of it [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=374.8s)]
*  Most of us make budgeting decisions for our businesses and families that have real-world [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=377.04s)]
*  Consequences we can decide what we need and don't need. Thank you very much and [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=382.36s)]
*  Quote that was the Wall Street Journal [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=387.64s)]
*  Trump ran in 2016 promising to strengthen the economy to uplift the forgotten man and women [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=391.28000000000003s)]
*  But here we are in 2025 he's telling these same people to accept less spend less expect less while pretending [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=396.71999999999997s)]
*  It's good for their own good as [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=402.96s)]
*  Our good friend Molly John Fass wondered so capitalism is bad now [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=405.03999999999996s)]
*  This is not a natural downturn in the economy. This is not a war economy [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=410.28s)]
*  This is not the result of some external disaster. It's the fallout from one man's economic choices and his refusal to course, correct [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=414.15999999999997s)]
*  austerity is for emergencies [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=422.24s)]
*  this [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=424.64s)]
*  economic gaslighting [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=426.4s)]
*  So no Donald Trump [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=428.4s)]
*  We're not buying the idea that [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=429.68s)]
*  Americans need to give up the things that keep daily life running just because you lit the house on fire and now want credit [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=431.28s)]
*  for handing us a water bucket [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=437.24s)]
*  Joining me now is the former Democratic congresswoman Katie Porter of California. She's now a law professor at the University of California Irvine [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=440.0s)]

*  Thank you, I want your take on this because this is nonsensical Donald Trump is at [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=453.20000000000005s)]
*  He does it in a very frivolous way [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=458.76000000000005s)]
*  He talks about strollers and dolls and and pretty girls who have them and things that mothers buy them. It's it's a weirdly gendered [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=460.52000000000004s)]
*  Unimportant stuff that doesn't matter the real economy be fine [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=468.96000000000004s)]
*  You just buy fewer pencils and strollers and and and dolls and the world to work out. Okay, it's a lot of BS [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=472.20000000000005s)]
*  It absolutely is this is not a man who's gonna be pushing a shopping cart with three kids in tow [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=478.52s)]
*  Through a Target or a Walmart in August when his tariffs are in full effect [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=485.24s)]
*  Trying to explain to this kids why they can't get all the items on the school shopping list [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=490.64s)]
*  Trying to take a hard look at whether they can shove their kids feet back in the same old sneakers [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=496.47999999999996s)]
*  Or make that worn-out backpack do one more year [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=502.03999999999996s)]
*  It's kind of sending and it's frankly offensive and it's particularly offensive to moms [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=505.56s)]
*  Because we're the ones when times get tough [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=510.8s)]
*  Women are the ones who are expected to make ends meet to just make do and so for him to talk in this way to [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=513.9200000000001s)]
*  The American people is so dismissive of working people and of what it's really like to be an American [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=520.6s)]
*  Well, he sits and as you said a gold gilded office [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=526.44s)]
*  Yeah, and and I just I don't really get how this is a an appeal to Republicans or conservatives [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=530.16s)]
*  I'm sure they've got the same problems [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=536.44s)]
*  There are Republicans and conservatives who are single mothers of three children like you are or hard-working people who don't have a lot [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=538.36s)]
*  Of extra money at the end of the day already suffering because of these tariffs already suffering because their goods are sitting [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=545.4s)]
*  Unexported or can't bring things in there's nobody who's willing to do that [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=552.56s)]
*  Unexported or can't bring things in there's nobody who thinks this is a good idea [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=557.28s)]
*  There are very few times in in this country's history where austerity has been called for and has been thought of as a shared experience [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=560.92s)]
*  No, that's right. He's he's not justifying it because we're having an actual national emergency [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=568.92s)]
*  He's manufacturing one and I think one of the reasons that we haven't seen the depth of outrage [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=575.0799999999999s)]
*  We are just at the beginning of these tariffs hitting home in people's shopping carts businesses order goods far in advance [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=580.88s)]
*  Six months a year in advance they contract for and pay for things [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=588.2399999999999s)]
*  The real pain is coming in the next couple months. It's gonna come it back to school time and by Christmas by the holidays [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=591.8399999999999s)]
*  It's gonna be really really tough for American families and you know who it's not gonna be tough for [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=598.76s)]
*  Donald Trump and and that's really the problem here [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=604.1999999999999s)]
*  This is somebody who claims to be interested in the American people in working people and Democrats [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=607.5999999999999s)]
*  You know are being told that we don't do enough for the working people [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=614.18s)]
*  Honestly, Trump could not be saying more clearly to American people to small businesses to our entire economy [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=617.9599999999999s)]
*  To everyone who depends on their job to make ends meet who has to walk into the grocery store [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=625.52s)]
*  Worried about the balance on their credit card or their bank account [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=632.28s)]
*  He's basically saying to them. I don't care and I don't see you and I don't understand [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=636.4799999999999s)]
*  Just how hard this is to do because I've never done it [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=642.5999999999999s)]
*  And so the only experience Donald Trump has with financial problems is creating them [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=647.1999999999999s)]
*  So you say it hasn't been felt yet and that's true in most cases [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=652.8s)]
*  We've seen some announcements of some layoffs, but over where you are in, California [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=655.8s)]
*  You've got the port of Long Beach and and and and Los Angeles [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=660.4s)]
*  We've got the port of Newark here in Elizabeth Long Beach in Los Angeles is where everything from China most things from China come in [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=663.64s)]
*  You ships were turned around there were ships that hadn't left that never left China [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=669.76s)]
*  The ships that were turned around the drop in supply in input into that port has been pretty dramatic [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=674.88s)]
*  I've seen numbers of 35 or 40 percent compared to last year. That's dock workers. That's longshoremen. That's truckers. That's warehouses [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=680.48s)]
*  That's the employees of the stores that those products go to [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=688.0s)]
*  It will be felt. This is not just about two dollars. This is about somebody's job [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=691.84s)]
*  It's about our entire economy, right? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=697.6s)]
*  It's about every aspect of our economy because even things that are made in America [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=700.24s)]
*  Of course have some component parts that come in from other countries [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=704.84s)]
*  And so it is actually already being felt very painfully by our small businesses by our ports [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=707.92s)]
*  People are having trouble getting supplies. They're having to [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=715.92s)]
*  Reconstitute their budget they're having to say no, I'm not gonna put that on the shelves [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=719.52s)]
*  No, I'm not gonna be able to stock three or four of those [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=724.0s)]
*  I'm only gonna stock one case of those items and it is already happening in our supply chain and it is coming [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=726.96s)]
*  I'm sad to say to a store near you and the only person the only person whose fault this is is Donald Trump [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=733.6s)]
*  We can't even blame as fun as it can be to say this is the fault of Republicans in Congress [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=741.72s)]
*  This is policy driven and set by Donald Trump and he is solely going to be responsible for it [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=747.52s)]
*  And he has to own all that political fallout and to set himself up for what's coming to try to tell American families [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=754.5600000000001s)]
*  It's gonna be about strollers. This Dan doesn't know [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=761.48s)]
*  Anything I'll try to keep it PG for us doesn't know anything about a stroller [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=765.76s)]
*  And so for him to try to tell us that it's just about strollers and dolls [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=769.8s)]
*  To kind of make this about things that girls or babies need. It's gross. Yeah [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=774.1999999999999s)]
*  It's it's very diminishing and the point is whatever makes strollers and pencils and and dolls more expensive is gonna make everything in your life [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=779.84s)]
*  More expensive Katie Porter great to see you. Thank you for being with us congresswoman Katie Porter former congresswoman [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=788.0s)]
*  Katie Porter is running for governor of California [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfNoykr7XMw&t=794.16s)]
