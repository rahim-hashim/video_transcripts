# ‘Trump wants to leave the Oval Office wealthier than when he came in’: Omarosa
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY)
*  New today, President Trump says he's open to the possibility of adding music mogul Sean [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=0.0s)]
*  Diddy Combs to his list of pardon recipients. Combs is currently on trial on sex trafficking [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=5.58s)]
*  and racketeering charges. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=11.84s)]
*  He used to really like me a lot, but I think when I ran for politics, he sort of that relationship [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=13.700000000000001s)]
*  busted up from what I read. I don't know. He didn't tell me that, but I'd read some [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=21.22s)]
*  little bit nasty statements and the paper all of a sudden. It's not a popularity contest. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=25.56s)]
*  So I don't know. I would certainly look at the facts. If I think somebody was mistreated, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=30.24s)]
*  whether they like me or don't like me, it wouldn't have any impact. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=36.2s)]
*  Joining me now, Omarosa Manigault Newman, former star of The Apprentice, former communications [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=40.6s)]
*  director for the Office of Public Liaison in the first Trump White House and author, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=45.36s)]
*  of course, of the bestselling book Unhinged, an insider's account of the Trump White House. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=50.08s)]
*  I'm going to offer you congratulations in just a second, but Sean Diddy Combs, really? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=55.839999999999996s)]
*  Have you been following this trial and how really just awful on so many levels it is? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=62.04s)]
*  Hey, Alex, look, I'm not surprised because remember, Donald Trump is not just the president [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=68.75999999999999s)]
*  of the United States, but he's the producer of the United States. He thinks that he's [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=74.92s)]
*  still operating as a producer in reality TV. He's going after headlines, shock and [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=78.84s)]
*  awe. But if you look really deeply at these allegations against Sean Combs, I think that [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=85.16s)]
*  he would be more reluctant about proactively offering a pardon. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=91.36s)]
*  Did you detect a whimsical element at all to him doing this, these pardon decisions? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=97.28s)]
*  I mean, they just kind of it's hard to understand the reasons and being concrete at the root of them. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=102.72s)]
*  Well, I think that in the first administration, he really waited too late to use his pardon [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=110.48s)]
*  power effectively. And so I can see that now he's going to leverage it. Anytime he wants to change [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=117.44s)]
*  the news cycle, get some headlines, get some attention, he'll just throw out a shock and [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=123.44s)]
*  shocking pardon like what he did with the Chrisley's this week. I mean, that's all everyone [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=129.12s)]
*  talked about. So, yes, he's going to leverage that clemency power that he has a little more [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=133.92s)]
*  this time than he did in the first administration. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=139.35999999999999s)]
*  You know, you mentioned the Chrisley's. Let's hear from Trump's pardon czar and one of the stars [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=142.16s)]
*  of the Chrisley's after the release. Here it is. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=147.6s)]
*  They call them the trumps of Georgia, but they were certainly over sentenced. I know that they're [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=151.68s)]
*  going to use their voices to in their platform to uplift the president's agenda. Even though [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=157.04s)]
*  this pardon has happened, I still was convicted of something that I did not do. Do I have any [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  remorse? I would have remorse if it was something that I did. OK, so earlier we heard Trump say it [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=168.95999999999998s)]
*  doesn't matter whether the recipients like him or not, but this is a life changing gift. And [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=174.39999999999998s)]
*  wouldn't you expect those pardon to be fierce advocates for Trump, maybe for the rest of their [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=179.68s)]
*  lives? Well, his daughter is actually a very fierce advocate for Donald Trump, and she is [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=184.88s)]
*  very proudly a member of MAGA. And she's the one that went to Mar-a-Lago and advocated for her [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=192.0s)]
*  parents to receive this pardon. So he did get the praise and the admiration that he wanted [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=198.24s)]
*  in exchange for this pardon from his daughter. There is a new Atlantic article in which Ashley [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=204.32s)]
*  Parker and Jonathan Lemire write that Trump at one point sought a summit with Russian President [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=211.28s)]
*  Putin that could turn into a made for TV moment to announce the end of the war and a long coveted [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=217.2s)]
*  Nobel Peace Prize for himself. They add that John Bolton told them Trump really wants a Nobel Peace [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=223.68s)]
*  Prize. He'll take it for Ukraine. He'll take it for Gaza. He'll take it for Pakistan, India. He's [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=230.32s)]
*  not particular. That's Bolton's quote there. Did you, Omarosa, ever hear him say that he wants a [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=235.76s)]
*  Nobel Peace Prize while you were in the White House? Does any of this sound plausible to you? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=241.35999999999999s)]
*  I don't think Donald wanted a Peace Prize until Barack Obama received one. And then he wouldn't [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=246.56s)]
*  stop talking about it. Barack Obama received one very early on in his presidency. And Donald [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=251.92s)]
*  believes that he has, in fact, earned the right to get a Nobel Peace Prize. And his followers [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=257.76s)]
*  believe that his work with the Taliban, negotiating the Taliban, the Abraham Accord, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=262.96s)]
*  his attempts with North Korea, have certainly earned him the right to put a Nobel Peace Prize [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=268.15999999999997s)]
*  on his mantle. But he's going to have to do a little bit more to earn that honor, in my opinion. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=273.44s)]
*  Yeah. I also want to get your thoughts on some of Trump's and his family's business [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=278.96s)]
*  investments in this second term. Ivanka and Jared, they are no longer in the White House, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=282.96s)]
*  but you have Eric Trump and Don Jr., who accompanied Vice President J.D. Vance [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=288.0s)]
*  at Bitcoin's biggest conference in Las Vegas this week. The Trump sons have also announced plans to [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=292.56s)]
*  buy $2.5 billion worth of Bitcoin. What do you think of Trump loosening government oversight [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=298.0s)]
*  and regulations around cryptocurrency while wading into his own crypto project? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=305.84s)]
*  You know, there is no limit to this grift. I mean, watching what Don and Eric are doing in [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=311.92s)]
*  the crypto space, I mean, it's just after we heard so much and their complaints about Hunter, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=316.64s)]
*  Hunter, Hunter Biden, and how Hunter leveraged his father's presidency to make all of this money, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=322.32s)]
*  we see that they're not reluctant in any way to utilize and leverage their father's presidency [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=328.71999999999997s)]
*  to put more money in their pocket. That's what you're seeing, is this major grift on their [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=335.68s)]
*  behalf, and they are completely erasing the boundaries that traditionally were set for [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=340.08s)]
*  families and what they did while parents were in the Oval Office. You're going to see more of this. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=344.88s)]
*  Remember, we're only about six months into the Trump presidency. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=350.08s)]
*  I know, I know. That dawned on me earlier this week. I said, oh boy. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=353.04s)]
*  Could it be that Trump's interpretation of presidential immunity that was given to him [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=357.92s)]
*  from last year's Supreme Court decision might be playing a role in some of his personal business [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=363.28s)]
*  decisions? Again, personal business decisions, but presidential immunity extends in his mind? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=368.4s)]
*  You know, what I've seen with Donald since that decision has come down is that he's just tearing [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=375.03999999999996s)]
*  apart what we traditionally saw presidents do while they were in the Oval Office. Donald Trump [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=382.08s)]
*  wants to leave the Oval Office wealthier than when he came in, and that means that he is going to [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=386.88s)]
*  strike deals that most presidents would never even think about, that he is going to blur lines that [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=392.23999999999995s)]
*  presidents have never done. But more importantly, he's going to utilize that idea of immunity [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=396.96s)]
*  to do whatever it is that he wants because he believes that he's not accountable to anyone. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=402.0s)]
*  Okay, well with my thanks and my congratulations, you just graduated. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=406.71999999999997s)]
*  You have an MBA and law degree now? I mean, you go girl. That is so amazing. I'm so impressed. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=410.96s)]
*  I mean, well done. Thank you so much. Okay, well, I appreciate you. All right, well I may have to call [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=417.59999999999997s)]
*  you up one day. I need some help. Anyway, I'm Rosa. Thank you so much. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFWbQkr9GY&t=422.16s)]
