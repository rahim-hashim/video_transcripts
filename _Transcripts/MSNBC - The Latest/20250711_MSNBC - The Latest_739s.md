# Nicolle Wallace: FBI in 'total meltdown mode' over Epstein files, giving agents polygraph tests
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [July 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o)
*  This polygraph test forced retirements and sudden mysterious unexplained absences. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=0.0s)]
*  A wave of brand new reporting reveals that the nation's top law enforcement agency [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=6.96s)]
*  has devolved into a Lord of the Flies situation under Donald Trump. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=11.92s)]
*  The New York Times reveals that the FBI has turned a tool normally used to root out those [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=16.64s)]
*  who may have betrayed the country against their own. Dozens of top FBI officials have reportedly [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=21.6s)]
*  been forced to take polygraph tests. Many of them have been asked, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=28.16s)]
*  whether they have said anything negative about FBI Director Cash Patel. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=32.4s)]
*  In one instance, officials were forced to take a polygraph as the agency sought to determine who [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=36.64s)]
*  disclosed the news that Mr. Patel had demanded a service weapon, an unusual request given that he's [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=42.24s)]
*  not an agent. The FBI has declined to comment to the New York Times, but former FBI officials are [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=49.36s)]
*  speaking out. The New York Times reports this, quote, the moves, former bureau officials say, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=55.2s)]
*  are politically charged and highly inappropriate, underscoring what they describe as an alarming [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=60.96s)]
*  quest for fealty at the FBI, where there is little tolerance for dissent. Disparaging Mr. Patel or [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=66.72s)]
*  his deputy, Dan Bongino, former officials say, could cost people their job. One of the agents [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=73.28s)]
*  who was ordered to take a polygraph test was a guest on this program on Wednesday, Michael [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=79.67999999999999s)]
*  Feinberg. He was forced out of the FBI over his friendship with former FBI agent Pete Strzok, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=84.72s)]
*  who has been a target of Donald Trump's now for years and years and years. In a post last week [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=90.96s)]
*  on the Lawfare blog, he writes this, quote, I would be asked to submit to a polygraph exam, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=96.47999999999999s)]
*  probing the nature of my friendship with Pete Strzok. And as I was quietly informed by another [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=102.0s)]
*  friendlier senior employee, what could only be described as a latter day struggle session, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=107.36s)]
*  I would be expected to grovel, beg forgiveness and pledge loyalty as part of the FBI's cultural [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=112.8s)]
*  revolution brought about by Patel and Bongino's ascension to the highest echelons of American [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=119.12s)]
*  law enforcement and intelligence. Feinberg quit before taking that polygraph and so have a lot [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=125.52s)]
*  of other people. According to the New York Times, quote, top agents in about 40% of the field [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=131.84s)]
*  offices have either retired, been ousted or moved into different jobs. All of this is happening [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=137.36s)]
*  as the top brass at the FBI and DOJ are in turmoil, roiled by the implosion of one of the biggest [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=144.56s)]
*  conspiracy theories that animates MAGA these days. It has to do with the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=151.52s)]
*  On that, Axios reports this, quote, FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino took a day off work Friday [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=158.0s)]
*  after clashing at the White House with Attorney General Pam Bondi over their handling of the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=165.2s)]
*  Jeffrey Epstein files. Bongino did not come to work on Friday, leading some insiders to believe [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=170.23999999999998s)]
*  he had quit. But administration officials say he is still on the job, even as the internal tension [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=176.32s)]
*  over the Epstein case continues. When staffers at the FBI are wondering if the Bureau's number [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=182.56s)]
*  two has abruptly quit and roughly 40% of all field offices have seen major upheaval, it should come [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=188.48s)]
*  as no surprise that concerns are mounting that the FBI is wholly unprepared to handle whatever [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=195.52s)]
*  comes its way. Last month at the height of the conflict with Iran, one former senior DOJ official [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=201.44s)]
*  told NBC News this, quote, the senior ranks of the FBI and DOJ's national security teams have [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=207.52s)]
*  been decimated. As a result, the FBI and Justice Department are completely unprepared to respond [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  to a crisis, including the fallout from the current conflict in the Middle East. An FBI led [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=219.04000000000002s)]
*  by allies of Donald Trump in total meltdown mode, potentially at the expense of U.S. national security [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=224.8s)]
*  is where we start today with New York Times national security reporter Adam Goldman. His [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=231.20000000000002s)]
*  byline is on that piece of reporting we read from. Also joining us, former assistant special [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=236.0s)]
*  agent in charge at the FBI. You aforementioned Michael Feinberg is back. Adam, let me start with [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=241.12s)]
*  you. And you're reporting on the polygraphs. Take me inside. I mean, the polygraph is a tool [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=247.68s)]
*  used by the FBI, but not in this fashion. Just explain to us what is so abnormal [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=256.8s)]
*  about the way they're using polygraphs. Well, I think people, they've been quickly used the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=263.76s)]
*  polygraphs in ways the bureau hasn't before. Of course, Mike Feinberg can tell you, of course, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=271.36s)]
*  he went through a poly when he joined the bureau and he went probably went through several five [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=276.8s)]
*  year polys to renew his top secret security clearance to ensure that, you know, he was [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=280.48s)]
*  being loyal to his country. But here we have an instance where, you know, they are using, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=286.48s)]
*  they deployed the poly to sort of suss out whether people are gossiping essentially about what's [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=292.56s)]
*  going on in the FBI, about HR moves, right? And about Cash wanting a gun when he's not an agent. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=300.32s)]
*  And, you know, we have been told dozens of people have been poly'd. And this is really [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=309.28s)]
*  stoking a culture of fear and intimidation inside the bureau in ways that I haven't seen before. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=314.96s)]
*  And by the way, normally, I think there were people who wouldn't talk to me, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=320.56s)]
*  but because of what is happening, they feel the need to reach out, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=324.64s)]
*  which for me is an extraordinary thing. Say more about that, Adam. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=329.28000000000003s)]
*  I think people are very concerned about the future of the FBI, where it's headed [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=335.76s)]
*  and moves that are going on inside. And, you know, these people traditionally are not media [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=344.16s)]
*  friendly. You know, talk not to, first of all, you're taught not to be media friendly at the FBI. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=350.48s)]
*  So, you know, for them to reach out and talk to me is, you know, is unusual. And I think underscores [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=355.20000000000005s)]
*  the alarm inside the bureau's halls. And I will note that the turnover you referenced, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=363.84000000000003s)]
*  about 40 percent, you know, I started keeping a spreadsheet of the top eight, at every field [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=372.72s)]
*  office, the 55 field offices, I recorded the names of who was in charge before January 20th, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=378.96000000000004s)]
*  anticipating they were going to do exactly what they said they were going to do. And they have. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=384.8s)]
*  Michael, jump in on this and remind us the circumstances around which you were [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=390.56s)]
*  going to be subjected to polygraph that had nothing to do with your renewal of security [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=396.88s)]
*  clearances. No, I was not due for a security clearance renewal for quite some time. And I was [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=402.4s)]
*  never, at any point in the past few months, actually at any point in my entire career, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=410.32s)]
*  ever accused of violating a policy or procedure, creating some sort of investigative deficiency, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=415.67999999999995s)]
*  or even transgressing against some sort of internal FBI cultural norm. The sole reason [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=423.59999999999997s)]
*  I was going to be subjected to a polygraph test was that I'm a social acquaintance, a friend of [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=431.12s)]
*  Pete Struck, who, as we all know, this administration considers a political enemy. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=437.68s)]
*  Michael, talk about what it does to the culture to start polygraphing senior members of the [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=445.35999999999996s)]
*  workforce and senior leaders of field offices out of suspicion of unflattering, and I guess, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=453.04s)]
*  in the case of the gun, true news accounts. It creates a culture that fundamentally [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=459.92s)]
*  undermines the ability of the FBI to do its own job. We are working in very controversial, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=467.04s)]
*  dangerous, and fast-moving situations. Whether you're on the criminal enforcement side of the [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=475.68s)]
*  house or whether you're dealing with national security threats. And in order to do that, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=481.36s)]
*  you have to be able to trust that you can have candid conversations with your bosses, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=488.0s)]
*  including individuals like Bongino and Patel, and you have to have a certain amount of comfort [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=494.15999999999997s)]
*  that they trust you too. If you are going to bring them bad news, if you're going to bring them hard [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=501.2s)]
*  facts, you need to know that they're going to listen. And if somebody is polygraphing you [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=507.12s)]
*  because of suspected political transgressions or because you've made fun of them, which, by the way, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=514.8s)]
*  is not against an FBI policy, the communication is going to naturally be stimmyed and facts that [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=522.16s)]
*  management needs to hear are going to fall through the cracks. I mean, let me just play some of Dan [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=529.68s)]
*  Bongino as a podcaster because I imagine the universe of people who've made fun of some of [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=535.2s)]
*  the things these guys said in their past life is massive. Let me just play this. People can decipher [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=540.24s)]
*  themselves. Ladies and gentlemen, the FBI is an absolute disaster. It is an abomination to the [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=546.4000000000001s)]
*  country. The corruption needs to be immediately defunded. The FBI should no longer exist as it's [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=553.76s)]
*  constituted now. The mission should be divvied up. The money should be divvied up amongst other [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=560.64s)]
*  agencies that take the road to the country seriously. We fire everyone who stood by. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=565.68s)]
*  We don't just fire the people who did this. Everyone who stood by and did nothing. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=573.76s)]
*  While the Department of Justice and the FBI have been ravaged by corruptocrats, everyone gets fired. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=579.68s)]
*  Everyone. If you stood by and did nothing. That's how. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=585.6s)]
*  Can I hit pause at this point and say, is there anyone at the FBI that wouldn't feel proud about [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=591.0400000000001s)]
*  their agency and be offended by a guy who craps all over the Bureau and its legacy and its mission [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=596.64s)]
*  and its fealty to the country? I mean, I'm not even sure I understand what the polygraph is [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=604.72s)]
*  meant to suss out, Adam Goldman. Well, it appears that the polygraph is meant to suss out, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=611.12s)]
*  obviously, who might be talking about internal discussions. I would note these discussions [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=623.28s)]
*  aren't even related to national security information or classified information. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=630.48s)]
*  They're taking aggressive steps in matters that don't even affect national security. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=636.4s)]
*  The one thing that's also happening, I think Mike could be a possible victim of this, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=641.76s)]
*  is a snitching culture. That somebody went to the seventh floor of the FBI, maybe Bongino, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=647.68s)]
*  and said Mike's friends were peach-struck. This is not the only case this has happened. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=656.88s)]
*  Being able to have frank discussions, but you're worried about people literally snitching inside [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=664.64s)]
*  the FBI, I think that's deeply alarming to people. It's not clear where it's going. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=668.48s)]
*  You talked about, you just aired those comments, those corrosive comments that Bongino has made [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=680.8000000000001s)]
*  about the FBI, but Bongino spent years eroding trust in the FBI, years, giving his listeners [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=687.6s)]
*  what they wanted, and eroding trust, the public's trust in the FBI. Now he's back, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=696.24s)]
*  and he wants us to believe, or he wants the public to believe that they're there, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=704.16s)]
*  that this corruption is gone. I think it's done significant harm to the Bureau's reputation and [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=707.28s)]
*  the way people perceive the Bureau. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W5TKPJjy4o&t=716.88s)]
