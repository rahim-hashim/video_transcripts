# ICE was 'misleading' mothers: Attorney for 2-year-old U.S. citizen removed to Honduras
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k)
*  With us now is Gracie Willis. He is an attorney with the National Immigration Project. She [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=0.0s)]
*  represents a two-year-old U.S. born child removed with her mother, two Honduras. Gracie, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=4.32s)]
*  it's always a pleasure to see you. I thank you for being back with us this week. I asked you [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=8.88s)]
*  to keep us updated on this case. You're kind enough to come back. What is the latest on that [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  case? Where is that two-year-old American born child right now? Thank you so much, Jose. We are [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  learning more and more every day about what these mothers went through when they were in ICE [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=24.0s)]
*  detention because we're now able to have contact with the mothers in Honduras. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=28.0s)]
*  And what's becoming increasingly clear is that ICE was misleading these mothers at every step of [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=31.76s)]
*  the way. What DHS is now presenting as a choice was actually a trap. These mothers had no options [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=36.56s)]
*  presented to them. They had no due process. There was no justice. What we know is that these mothers [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=42.8s)]
*  didn't willingly present their children or their passports for deportation. There was a series of [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=48.56s)]
*  misleading information that ICE was giving these mothers. For one mother, they told her that she [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=54.08s)]
*  was coming in for a family visit, for a wellness check of her children. For the other, they told [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=58.56s)]
*  her that she was coming in to have her ankle monitor serviced. In both situations, the mothers [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=63.68s)]
*  were asked to present the passports just so that ICE could make copies of them, and then they didn't [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=69.67999999999999s)]
*  see those passports again until they were in Honduras. So neither of these mothers presented [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=75.28s)]
*  willingly their children or their passports knowing that it would lead to their deportation. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=80.48s)]
*  ICE told them, you will be deported with your children. There were no options presented to them. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=84.80000000000001s)]
*  So, Gracie, so these were not cases that had already been adjudicated and found to have [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  deportation orders? They were still in the process? For both of these mothers, there were [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=95.44s)]
*  circumstances beyond their control that led to an inability to appear at one single immigration court [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=100.80000000000001s)]
*  hearing. Neither had had their hearing heard, their cases heard before an immigration judge, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=106.08s)]
*  and that puts them in a position of having an opportunity to present those extraordinary [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=110.96s)]
*  circumstances outside of their control to a judge through a filing. And there were attorneys [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  ready, willing, and able to work on those filings, complete those filings, and get them in front of [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=121.92s)]
*  an immigration judge, but were unable to ultimately because the mothers were held in isolation, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=126.72s)]
*  in communicado and unable to communicate with those lawyers. So where is that child right now [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=131.60000000000002s)]
*  and what are the efforts underway or are there any efforts underway to bring that child back [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=138.08s)]
*  to the country where he was born? The families are in Honduras where they were deported on Friday. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=144.32000000000002s)]
*  The families are still focusing on the initial health and safety issues for the families there [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=151.04000000000002s)]
*  and are trying to work through the really complicated next steps. It's a different decision [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=157.04000000000002s)]
*  should a child stay versus should a child come back. These families have been through unimaginable [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=162.24s)]
*  trauma and are still working through what the next steps for these children will be. And especially [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=166.72s)]
*  the primary focus is making sure that that four-year-old has access to medication and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=171.60000000000002s)]
*  treatment for his cancer. And has that been supplied to that child? I believe the family is [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=175.52s)]
*  still working to make sure that that's available. Certainly the immigration authorities didn't make [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=182.24s)]
*  any effort to ensure that the child had the medication for that deportation flight. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=187.12s)]
*  Do you know if the fathers of these U.S. born children have been in contact with either the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=191.76000000000002s)]
*  mothers or legal officials or even somebody in the Honduran government to see what help they [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=197.44s)]
*  need to be getting right now as this process is cleared up? The fathers and mothers have been [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=204.08s)]
*  in touch and are trying to figure out what those next steps are. Gracie, what is it that you have [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=211.2s)]
*  to say to people that may be watching and that may live in a, for example, a mixed immigration [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=219.28s)]
*  status household where their parents or their loved ones are going through a process right now [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=224.95999999999998s)]
*  and may have a griete, have the ankle bracelet and are facing, I don't know, a meeting coming up. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=232.24s)]
*  What do you say to those people? What we're seeing with these two families and other situations that [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=243.28s)]
*  have come to light over the last several days is that ICE is engaging in increasing incursion into [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=250.0s)]
*  the private family lives of families, these decisions that families should be making together. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=256.16s)]
*  There's no right or wrong decision about what to do with a child and what decision a family should [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=262.16s)]
*  make in these really challenging circumstances, but what's key and most important is that the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=267.6s)]
*  family gets to make that decision. ICE has policies around the family being able to make these [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=272.64000000000004s)]
*  decisions but doesn't appear to be following those policies. In multiple cases, we're seeing the [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=277.68s)]
*  wishes of the families just ignored by ICE and what's critical is that we make it clear that [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=282.48s)]
*  we're not going to tolerate that. It's a basic, moral, foundational principle that families should [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=288.08000000000004s)]
*  be able to decide what's in the best interest of their children and that's what we're trying to [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  ensure happens. Gracie, these mothers say that they really did not know, they were not given the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=297.44s)]
*  basic courtesy of at least having the time to process what to do with their children. Is that [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=302.8s)]
*  what they say? That's correct. They were never presented with would you like this option or that [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=312.24s)]
*  option. They were never presented with would you like to speak to another caregiver available [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=317.6s)]
*  for your children. They were told your children will be deported with you and even if they were [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=322.40000000000003s)]
*  offered a choice, it's not a willing and voluntary choice. If made under duress, in isolation, unable [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=327.12s)]
*  to speak with anybody, a caregiver, an attorney, anybody, those aren't circumstances that anybody [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=333.44s)]
*  could be expected to make a really, really tough decision. Gracie, let's continue this conversation, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=338.48s)]
*  okay? Thank you so much. Tomorrow, Friday, we need to stay on this, okay? I appreciate it. Thanks. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=344.64000000000004s)]
*  you [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMviLv8tt0k&t=368.48s)]
