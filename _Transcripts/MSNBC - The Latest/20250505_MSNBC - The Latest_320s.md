# What to expect from jury selection in Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs trial
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4)
*  Joining me now is NBC's Raheima Ellis, who is outside the courthouse for us, and former [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=0.0s)]
*  Brooklyn and Queens prosecutor and defense attorney Deanna Paul. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=4.72s)]
*  Okay, Raheima, take us inside court. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=8.0s)]
*  What's been happening there? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=10.0s)]
*  One of the things I want to say, Chris, is that in defense of Sean Diddy Combs, his lawyers [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=12.88s)]
*  are saying that these accusers are ex-girlfriends and all of the sex was consensual. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=18.44s)]
*  It was a part of consensual relationships. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=23.48s)]
*  We just found out that the jurors have taken a lunch break that's going to be for about [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=26.16s)]
*  an hour. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=30.04s)]
*  There's been questioning going on for about three and a half hours, with the exception [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=31.04s)]
*  of one short break. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  And several names have come up during the course of this, celebrity names such as Kanye [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=35.96s)]
*  West, Michael B. Jordan, and the actor Mike Myers. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=39.96s)]
*  None of them have been accused of anything. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=44.36s)]
*  And we don't know exactly why these names are coming up, that they're asking the prospective [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=47.36s)]
*  jurors if they have any knowledge of these people. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  Many of them said yes. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  It's not surprising. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=55.12s)]
*  They are, after all, celebrities. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=56.12s)]
*  We want to show you also some sketches we have of Diddy Combs. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=57.76s)]
*  You'll see him, he is in the courtroom. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=62.12s)]
*  He is not wearing that prison outfit that he was assigned when he was arrested back [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=64.47999999999999s)]
*  in September, but instead he's in a white college shirt, a black pruneck sweater, gray [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=69.28s)]
*  slacks, and he's clean shaven with the exception of a little gray goatee. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=74.0s)]
*  And his hair is gray. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=79.08s)]
*  He was going gray before he went into prison. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=80.08s)]
*  In prison, they're not allowed to use hair dye, so his hair is more natural at this point. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=83.52000000000001s)]
*  So lots of questions have been going on. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=89.12s)]
*  Several jurors have been excused for one reason or another. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=91.62s)]
*  Many others who did say they knew about Diddy, they knew, they know about the charges that [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=94.28s)]
*  he's been accused of, but they said they had not formed an opinion. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=99.56s)]
*  One person said that he is presumed innocent until proven otherwise. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=103.36000000000001s)]
*  That's where we are at this point. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=107.92s)]
*  Chris? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=109.56s)]
*  Thank you so much, Rahima. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=110.56s)]
*  I appreciate that. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=111.56s)]
*  Let's start with the basics, because whenever you have somebody who's as famous as Diddy [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=112.84s)]
*  is, household name, does that complicate jury selection? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=121.28s)]
*  This is one of those rare cases where it's safe to assume that any prospective juror [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=122.28s)]
*  knows who Sean Combs is and has probably seen the video of him seemingly assaulting his [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=126.60000000000001s)]
*  ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=131.12s)]
*  So the goal of jury selection is to weed out anyone that can't put aside any sort of preconceived [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=133.16s)]
*  notions. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=138.4s)]
*  You're going to be asked about domestic violence, about group sex, about drug use, about hip [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=139.4s)]
*  hop. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=143.88s)]
*  And if there's a juror that says that they can't be fair, they'll likely be excused. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=144.88s)]
*  I want to ask about that tape, because it was only recently that the judge ruled that [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=149.36s)]
*  that hotel surveillance video, I think it was recorded back in 2016, it shows him beating, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=152.84s)]
*  kicking, dragging Cassie Ventura. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=159.12s)]
*  It's difficult to watch. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=162.0s)]
*  If you're part of the defense team, how tough is that? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=165.56s)]
*  That's going to be an uphill battle for the defense. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=170.36s)]
*  It's one of those things that you see and the video speaks for itself. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=172.56s)]
*  How do you really counter that? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=176.04s)]
*  Especially where he had denied everything until the video came out. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=177.04s)]
*  But there's also been some good evidentiary rulings for the defense. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=180.6s)]
*  The judge just the other day said that of the four people, four accusers, who the government [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=184.0s)]
*  had wanted to come in and testify as prior Med Act witnesses, he's only allowing one [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=189.66s)]
*  of them. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=193.6s)]
*  And that type of evidence can be really powerful for a jury when they hear it to lead them [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=194.72s)]
*  to conclude that somebody has a propensity to commit sex crimes. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=199.20000000000002s)]
*  And you know, one of the attorneys on the defense team, he represented, he has a long [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=203.28s)]
*  history of representing these kinds of cases. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=210.20000000000002s)]
*  He represented young thugs in the Georgia case. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=214.28s)]
*  I think that was the longest ever criminal trial in that state's history. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=216.64000000000001s)]
*  He's so well known that Drake named a song after him. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=220.4s)]
*  What do we know about Brian Steele? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=224.88s)]
*  So we know that he just came off of the young thug case, which was, as you said, the longest [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=228.76s)]
*  prosecution in Georgia. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=234.14000000000001s)]
*  It was a Rico case. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=235.14000000000001s)]
*  And he was successful in that case. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=237.08s)]
*  And Rico is a really powerful tool for prosecutors where they can string together disparate events [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=239.04000000000002s)]
*  into one cohesive narrative. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=243.72s)]
*  And so having someone with recent successful experience in that realm is going to be important [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=245.76s)]
*  here. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=251.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=252.07999999999998s)]
*  And again, as you say, a Rico trial is something that can be a very powerful tool. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=253.07999999999998s)]
*  And it kind of gave him a lot of notoriety, a very different kind of case, though, right? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=259.4s)]
*  So I'm trying to figure out if there is a tie besides the fact that he's successful [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=265.48s)]
*  that you would hire him. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=270.88s)]
*  We both read a New Yorker article about him, which talks about his likability. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=273.8s)]
*  And having him in the courtroom, it's someone that New York jurors may not be as familiar [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=279.15999999999997s)]
*  with. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=283.64s)]
*  And he comes to it with obviously a wealth of criminal defense experience. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=284.64s)]
*  And so when it comes to cross-examining witnesses, all of his experience is going to lend itself [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=288.44s)]
*  to defending Sean Combs in the best possible way. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=292.8s)]
*  Rahima Ella, thanks to you. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=296.76s)]
*  Deanna Paul, thank you very much. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1CxSnHnoZ4&t=298.68s)]
