# Is damage already done from tariffs on China? U.S. factories 'in danger of shutting down'
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7YdjUPIoc)
*  Joining us now is former U.S. Ambassador to China and former Commerce Secretary under President Obama, Gary Locke. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7YdjUPIoc&t=0.0s)]
*  Ambassador, President Trump spoke about his phone call briefly with President Xi yesterday. Just take a listen to what he said. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7YdjUPIoc&t=7.0s)]
*  We have the deal. I mean, we've had a deal. We announced the deal. And I guess you could say, I wouldn't even say finalizing it up, Scott. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7YdjUPIoc&t=16.0s)]
*  I would say we have a deal and we're going to just make sure that everybody understands what the deal is. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7YdjUPIoc&t=25.0s)]
*  Sounds a little nonchalant. What do you make of the tone there? Do you believe the White House is taking this seriously? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7YdjUPIoc&t=31.0s)]
*  Well, obviously they're taking the conversation with President Xi Jinping very seriously. And we've got to get the trade talks back on track. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7YdjUPIoc&t=37.0s)]
*  Both sides are really reeling from not just the not so much the tariffs, but all the countermeasures that have been aimed at each other. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7YdjUPIoc&t=45.0s)]
*  And American factories are in danger of shutting down because they don't have access to these rare earths, especially these rare earth magnets that are predominantly made and supplied by China. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7YdjUPIoc&t=54.0s)]
*  And these are magnets that are used in the steering systems, the brake systems, the engine systems of our automobiles, but also semiconductors, manufacturing robotics, and even our jet airplanes, military aircraft. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7YdjUPIoc&t=68.0s)]
*  Airplanes and ballistic missiles. So we've got to figure this out. We've got to we've got to get this thing resolved as quickly as possible. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7YdjUPIoc&t=84.0s)]
*  The president kept saying that there's a deal. In fact, he accounted it four times. He used that word deal in that very brief clip that we just showed. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7YdjUPIoc&t=91.0s)]
*  But is there actually a deal based on what we know? No, there's no deal because the president Xi Jinping is not going to engage in deal making. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7YdjUPIoc&t=101.0s)]
*  He'll perhaps say, yes, we'll address some of these issues. We will look at the applications for exports of these rare earth minerals to the United States. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7YdjUPIoc&t=110.0s)]
*  But China has imposed and set up a licensing system the same way that America has set up a licensing system on the export of what we consider key technologies around the world, and especially to China. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7YdjUPIoc&t=122.0s)]
*  China now is doing the same thing, saying that these rare earth minerals could be used for military purposes. In fact, they are used in the fighter jets and in our ballistic missiles. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7YdjUPIoc&t=134.0s)]
*  So China is saying, well, we've got to be sure how these rare earth minerals are going to be used. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7YdjUPIoc&t=145.0s)]
*  So he's going to say to the negotiators, you go figure this out, but make sure that China gets a fair deal. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7YdjUPIoc&t=150.0s)]
*  So I don't believe that there is a deal made just between the two presidents. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7YdjUPIoc&t=157.0s)]
*  Let's just say Trump's able to secure deals with every country in the world down the road here. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7YdjUPIoc&t=162.0s)]
*  Has the damage already been done for both big and small businesses, for example, a small business owner in Iowa? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7YdjUPIoc&t=168.0s)]
*  Well, it's awfully late, for instance, for many businesses to get the supplies that they need and the products they need for even the Christmas season. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7YdjUPIoc&t=176.0s)]
*  It's going to take a long time for those manufacturing facilities in China to ramp up. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7YdjUPIoc&t=183.0s)]
*  And of course, the shipping rates now have gone through the roof. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7YdjUPIoc&t=189.0s)]
*  Everybody will be trying to get their product into the United States, and that's going to create a lot of demand for ships, and they'll be able to charge a lot more. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7YdjUPIoc&t=193.0s)]
*  So prices are going up no matter what. And it's unfortunate. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7YdjUPIoc&t=201.0s)]
*  China says she brought up the issue of Taiwan with President Trump, saying that she emphasized, quote, that the U.S. must handle the Taiwan question with prudence. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7YdjUPIoc&t=206.0s)]
*  If you're the tiny Taiwanese government, how are you reading that? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7YdjUPIoc&t=216.0s)]
*  That is something that the Chinese leaders will always bring up in every conversation, even among their top level negotiators with our cabinet secretaries and certainly with the president. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7YdjUPIoc&t=221.0s)]
*  President Xi Jinping has to always mention Taiwan for his own domestic audience and to instill nationalism and to keep his population safe. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7YdjUPIoc&t=233.0s)]
*  Supportive of his policies. Do you have confidence that the Trump administration effectively won't get played by President Xi? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7YdjUPIoc&t=246.0s)]
*  Well, I think the United States understands just how much leverage China has, especially using these rare earth minerals as a as a card. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7YdjUPIoc&t=255.0s)]
*  Many of our factories are looking at having to shut down production. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7YdjUPIoc&t=266.0s)]
*  In fact, Ford Motor Company shut down, temporarily shut down one of their production lines a few weeks ago because they ran out of these rare earth minerals, magnets that are used in their engines, their steering systems, their brake systems. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7YdjUPIoc&t=271.0s)]
*  And I think American industry and even our military are very concerned about the shortage of these highly specialized heat resistant magnets that are used in so many high end products. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7YdjUPIoc&t=285.0s)]
*  China, on the other hand, is concerned about the lack of orders with the tariffs. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7YdjUPIoc&t=297.0s)]
*  Manufacturing is manufacturing plants are shutting down or laying off people. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7YdjUPIoc&t=301.0s)]
*  And so China is worried about their own economy. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7YdjUPIoc&t=306.0s)]
*  So both sides have an incentive to really get back to the table and try to hammer something out. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7YdjUPIoc&t=310.0s)]
*  Ambassador Gary Locke, thank you very much for taking the time. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7YdjUPIoc&t=315.0s)]
*  I know it's still pretty early there on the West Coast and it's a Friday to boot. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7YdjUPIoc&t=318.0s)]
*  So hope you have a great weekend. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7YdjUPIoc&t=323.0s)]
*  Thank you again. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7YdjUPIoc&t=324.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7YdjUPIoc&t=339.0s)]
