# 'America alone': Stephanie Ruhle on the reality of Trump's trade war
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags)
*  This evening we learned Treasury Secretary Scott Besson and Trade Representative James [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=0.0s)]
*  Ingreer will finally meet with Chinese officials later this week. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=4.44s)]
*  It is the first confirmed meeting between the two countries since the President's tariffs [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=8.6s)]
*  went into effect. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=13.24s)]
*  It has been more than a month since Liberation Day. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=14.24s)]
*  And investors, they have made it clear that they are very nervous about the lack of deals [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=16.82s)]
*  so far. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=21.06s)]
*  And it does not help that the bold messaging from the administration last month have turned [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=22.06s)]
*  into new calls for patience. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=27.12s)]
*  Every country's called us. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=30.96s)]
*  That's the beauty of what we do. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=31.96s)]
*  We put ourselves in the driver's seat. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=32.96s)]
*  We're doing very well in making, I call them tailored deals, not off the rack. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=37.96s)]
*  These are tailored, highly tailored deals. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=41.72s)]
*  I'm telling you, these countries are calling us up, kissing my ass. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=43.84s)]
*  They are. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=48.2s)]
*  They are dying to make a deal. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=49.44s)]
*  It has brought more than 75 countries forward to negotiate. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=51.2s)]
*  We don't want a deal that's going to be a bad deal or I could make every deal in one [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=55.64s)]
*  day if I wanted to. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=60.04s)]
*  Let me just say 90 deals in 90 days. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=61.04s)]
*  President Trump has brought hundreds of countries now from around the world to the negotiating [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=64.44s)]
*  table. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=69.84s)]
*  This is the art of the deal. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=70.84s)]
*  President Trump creates what I would call strategic uncertainty in the negotiations. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=71.84s)]
*  Now we've only got 90 days and we've only got 60 left. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=75.88s)]
*  So these things are coming. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=78.8s)]
*  But you've got to be patient. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=79.8s)]
*  Everyone says, when, when, when are you going to sign deals? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=80.8s)]
*  We don't have to sign deals. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=83.8s)]
*  They have to sign deals with us. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=85.28s)]
*  Historically, it has taken 18 months on average for the United States to negotiate any trade [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=88.04s)]
*  deal. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=94.92s)]
*  And remember, most countries are facing basically one trade war as opposed to the United States, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=95.92s)]
*  which is now tangled up in 200. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=101.64s)]
*  Those other countries can seek alternative trading partners. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=104.68s)]
*  We cannot. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=107.4s)]
*  Despite what Secretary Besson and others say that America first is not America alone. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=108.52000000000001s)]
*  Well, America alone is exactly where we find ourselves. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=113.44s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=116.88s)]
*  Because the president put us here. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=117.88s)]
*  Joining me now, Barry Ritholtz, dear friend of mine, co-founder, chairman and investment [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=120.16s)]
*  officer of Ritholtz Wealth Management and host of the Masters in Business Must Listen [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=124.16s)]
*  to podcast on Bloomberg Radio and Max Chapkin, Bloomberg Businessweek journalist and co-host [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=128.4s)]
*  of the Elon Inc podcast. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=133.4s)]
*  Barry, does this administration get yet that China is not going to be publicly played or [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=135.04s)]
*  publicly humiliated? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=142.38s)]
*  Xi Jinping is not up for that. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=143.86s)]
*  Yeah, I'm kind of surprised to see that this completely unthought out sort of off the cuff [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=145.98s)]
*  tariff deal hasn't resulted in China bending to American wheel. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=154.66s)]
*  Well, who could have predicted that? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=159.3s)]
*  Everyone. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=161.74s)]
*  Anyone who has ever studied economics, global economics or China could have told you that. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=162.74s)]
*  So you have to wonder what the end game is here because it just has seemed to be so haphazard [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=167.5s)]
*  and random and just simply not strategically thought out. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=174.9s)]
*  I don't know what they thought was going to be the outcome of this unforced error of just [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=181.22s)]
*  declaring a war on our closest trading partners and allies. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=187.94s)]
*  It kind of beggars the imagination. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=192.88s)]
*  Well, let's go back to this point. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=195.42000000000002s)]
*  I was just trying to make all these other countries, they've got one trade deal to negotiate [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=197.14s)]
*  them versus the United States. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=201.7s)]
*  We have 200. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=203.94s)]
*  How does that not put us in a complicated weak position? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=205.7s)]
*  Well, you think about this conversation about strategic uncertainty or whatever. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=208.54s)]
*  And I could sort of- [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=212.73999999999998s)]
*  Can we just be clear? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=213.73999999999998s)]
*  Do you know how insulting it is to say this is strategic uncertainty when we've got businesses [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=214.73999999999998s)]
*  big and small holding on for dear life? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=219.85999999999999s)]
*  I was going to say businesses' strategic uncertainty is terrible. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=222.82s)]
*  It's a disaster because there's no ability to plan. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=228.06s)]
*  There is a version of this trade war, these tariffs that you could sort of squint and [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=230.5s)]
*  imagine it working if it's very deliberate, if you're giving people lots of time to whatever, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=235.14s)]
*  make adjustments, invest and so on. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=240.1s)]
*  But none of that is happening. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=242.54s)]
*  It's just seat of the pants ad hoc. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=243.98s)]
*  And as you said, the best case is some kind of frantic deal making that's going to leave [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=246.1s)]
*  businesses with whiplash or worse. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=251.7s)]
*  I want to share more of what Secretary Scott Besson said in his hearing today. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=253.9s)]
*  Who pays tariffs, Mr. Secretary? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=259.7s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=267.3s)]
*  Answer the questions I asked, please. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=268.3s)]
*  I only have five minutes. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=269.5s)]
*  Who pays tariffs? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=270.5s)]
*  Sorry? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=271.5s)]
*  Who pays tariffs? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=272.5s)]
*  Sorry? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=273.5s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, please. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=274.5s)]
*  The question is very simply, who pays tariffs, Mr. Chairman? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=275.5s)]
*  I'd like him to answer that question. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=277.9s)]
*  He wants to answer other questions. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=279.7s)]
*  Congressman, if the exporters dislike tariffs so much, why wouldn't they, if I think what [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=281.7s)]
*  you're trying to get me to say... [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=295.5s)]
*  Did you remember the question? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=296.5s)]
*  I'm not sure you did. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=297.5s)]
*  Who pays tariffs? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=298.5s)]
*  It's a very complicated question. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=299.5s)]
*  So I'll ask one more time, who pays tariffs? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=302.7s)]
*  The history would show that it is a complicated mix of who pays the tariffs over various times. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=307.7s)]
*  Who runs Barter Town? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=314.7s)]
*  With an answer like that, he deserves to be in the Thunderdome. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=316.7s)]
*  I mean, was that like the dog ate my homework? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=319.7s)]
*  That is absolutely humiliating that our Treasury Secretary cannot answer a question that is [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=322.5s)]
*  Economics 101. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=327.82s)]
*  Or will not. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=328.82s)]
*  I was going to say, he can answer the question, but it'll make his boss angry. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=329.82s)]
*  Look, there's only two possible parties who are going to pay the tariffs. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=335.5s)]
*  Either the consumers, for whom it's a giant European vat-like tax, right? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=340.1s)]
*  Tariffs are America's version of the VAT tax. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=347.38s)]
*  Which is why Trump didn't want Bezos to show it on his website. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=348.38s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=351.3s)]
*  Or businesses, which if it's not businesses, why are they begging for exemptions, Biggie? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=352.3s)]
*  Or the alternative is the manufacturers and exporters to the United States will suffer [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=356.74s)]
*  a decrease in margin, but history, to quote the Treasury Secretary, shows that's not what happens. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=363.9s)]
*  Consumers pay tariffs. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=369.9s)]
*  And even worse, what's supposed to give American manufacturing a leg up, what happens is the domestic [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=372.9s)]
*  producers say, oh, these guys can get more money? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=380.9s)]
*  Let's raise our prices. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=383.9s)]
*  So tariffs not only cost consumer more money for imports, but it's inflationary for domestically [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=384.9s)]
*  produced goods and services. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=391.9s)]
*  So Donald Trump is what he promised to be the most powerful man in the world because this single man [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=392.9s)]
*  has managed to hurt GDP in basically the entire world. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=398.9s)]
*  I want to change subjects. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=402.9s)]
*  You haven't seen it come into GDP yet because January, February, March, the news, the GDP data that was [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=403.9s)]
*  released last month did not account for April 2nd Liberation Day. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=412.9s)]
*  That's not going to show up till we get the Q2 data in July, which appears to be going to be a stinker. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=419.9s)]
*  That's a nice way to put it. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=428.9s)]
*  I want to shift subjects slightly because the IRS has now lost 31 percent of its auditors because of the [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=430.9s)]
*  Doge downsizing. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=437.9s)]
*  You know all about Doge. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=438.9s)]
*  And to be clear, this could end up costing our government billions of dollars. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=439.9s)]
*  Auditors pay for themselves. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=445.9s)]
*  OK. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=447.9s)]
*  So the research shows the IRS collects six dollars for every one dollar spent on audits of high income [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=448.9s)]
*  taxpayers. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=455.9s)]
*  I get it. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=456.9s)]
*  Nobody's a fan of the IRS. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=457.9s)]
*  Nobody likes to do their taxes. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=458.9s)]
*  But if we don't have people working at the IRS collecting taxes, we're only going to be deeper in the hole. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=459.9s)]
*  I mean, this is a case where I think it's just entirely about partisanship. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=465.9s)]
*  But that said, you know, we're verging towards Doge costing significantly more. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=469.9s)]
*  So the estimates have gone from two trillion to one trillion to one hundred and fifty billion. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=475.9s)]
*  Now we're seeing reports that they're going to have to spend one hundred and thirty billion to rehire employees. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=480.9s)]
*  And then when you layer on these losses in tax revenue, it could add up a lot. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=486.9s)]
*  I saw estimates anywhere from tens of billions to trillion dollars over 10 years. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=491.9s)]
*  So we're talking about huge sums of money that the U.S. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=497.9s)]
*  is going to have to find a way to make up elsewhere. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=500.9s)]
*  And if Scott Besson's number one focus was debt and deficit and if what he really wants to do are tax cuts, this new budget bill, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=502.9s)]
*  how are you going to get all that to happen when this whole deficit they were going to take on is only going to get bigger? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=509.9s)]
*  They don't care about deficits. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=513.9s)]
*  They don't care about debt. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=514.9s)]
*  That's a giant act. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=516.9s)]
*  Trump's biggest accomplishment in his first term is crypto. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=518.9s)]
*  What? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=522.9s)]
*  No, the first term was the tax cuts and job acts. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=523.9s)]
*  He delivered at least on that. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=526.9s)]
*  He delivered exactly what he promised. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=529.9s)]
*  We're going to create giant tax cuts. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=531.9s)]
*  Yeah, maybe they were a little inflationary. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=533.9s)]
*  Maybe they're a little stimulative. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=535.9s)]
*  But many of his colleagues and friends love them. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=537.9s)]
*  And he wants a repeat of that. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=540.9s)]
*  So all these distractions and you talked about this last night on the show, all this nonsense about becoming pope and Canada's the fifty first state [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=542.9s)]
*  and the third term. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=551.9s)]
*  And these are all distractions. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=553.9s)]
*  The real thing that's happening is in a lot of courts, just like in 2020, he's losing a lot of these cases. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=555.9s)]
*  That's where that one hundred and thirty billion dollars of you're not authorized to do this. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=562.9s)]
*  You have to pay these people. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=566.9s)]
*  What's really going on is the distraction of these key things. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=569.9s)]
*  The IRS is just the tip of the iceberg. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=572.9s)]
*  Well, guess what? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=575.9s)]
*  We're not going to be distracted. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=576.9s)]
*  And that is not bias. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=577.9s)]
*  We're going to cover the administration every night of the week with facts. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1JSmkxtags&t=579.9s)]
