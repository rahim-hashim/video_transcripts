# 'So fanciful, so farcical': Outrage over Trump saying U.S. will 'take over' Gaza
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g)
*  As the Bible says, blessed are the peacemakers. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=0.0s)]
*  And in that end, I hope my greatest legacy, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=3.0s)]
*  when it's all finished, will be known as a peacemaker [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  and a unifier. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=9.88s)]
*  I hope that's going to be true. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=10.84s)]
*  That was President Trump at the National Prayer Breakfast [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=14.64s)]
*  this morning after he doubled down [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=16.96s)]
*  on his proposal for the US to take control of Gaza [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  and for Palestinians to be resettled. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=22.32s)]
*  The president, writing on Truth Social, quote, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  that Gaza Strip would be turned over to the United States [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=27.32s)]
*  by Israel at the conclusion of fighting [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=29.64s)]
*  and that the Palestinian people will be, quote, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=32.4s)]
*  resettled in far safer and more beautiful communities [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=34.68s)]
*  with new and modern homes in the region. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=38.28s)]
*  Moments ago, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=41.28s)]
*  met with lawmakers on Capitol Hill [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=43.56s)]
*  and he was asked about President Trump's proposal. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=45.24s)]
*  Here's what he had to say. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=47.96s)]
*  Mr. Netanyahu, do you think we're needed in Gaza [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=51.64s)]
*  Are we in? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=55.76s)]
*  Are we in? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=56.56s)]
*  Are we in? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=57.4s)]
*  No. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=58.8s)]
*  Joining us now from Tel Aviv is NBC's Yasmin Amosugi [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=61.68s)]
*  and also with us, Peter Baker, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=64.32s)]
*  New York Times chief White House correspondent [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=65.48s)]
*  and an NBC News political analyst. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=67.88s)]
*  So Yasmin, President Trump is making statements about Gaza [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=69.48s)]
*  as the ceasefire negotiations are trying to move [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=73.32s)]
*  to the next phase, a very delicate phase. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=75.92s)]
*  Yeah, incredibly delicate. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=81.8s)]
*  While the Prime Minister is gifting President Trump [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=83.44000000000001s)]
*  with a gold pager as a reference to those surprise attacks [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=86.04s)]
*  on Hezbollah fighters, you have to understand [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=90.04s)]
*  the landscape here in Israel right now, Jose, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=93.04s)]
*  to really see how fragile this moment is [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=96.08000000000001s)]
*  for this ceasefire deal and even getting to phase two. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=99.28s)]
*  If you look at what's happening in the West Bank, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=102.92s)]
*  many feeling as if the war has actually shifted [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=104.64000000000001s)]
*  to the West Bank. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=106.68s)]
*  The continued explosions in Jenin just last weekend, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=108.28s)]
*  100 plus residential buildings were in fact exploded, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=111.2s)]
*  people losing their homes, their belongings, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=114.52s)]
*  30,000 plus Palestinians evacuated from Jenin camp. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=116.39999999999999s)]
*  And then you talk about the hostages, right? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=121.32s)]
*  We're supposed to get three more names tomorrow, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=124.39999999999999s)]
*  three more hostages released on Saturday, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=126.56s)]
*  79 hostages remaining in Hamas captivity, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=129.28s)]
*  Hamas potentially wondering how they'll have the upper hand [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=133.48s)]
*  if they continue on with this ceasefire deal. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=136.64s)]
*  And then the family forum, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=139.07999999999998s)]
*  the family members of the hostages incredibly worried [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=141.04s)]
*  that their family members will fall by the wayside [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=144.6s)]
*  because of this rhetoric that is coming out of Washington [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=148.35999999999999s)]
*  and from Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=151.92s)]
*  and calling for Palestinians to leave Gaza. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=153.72s)]
*  I actually sat down with Aviva Siegel, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=157.51999999999998s)]
*  the wife of Keith Siegel, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=160.16s)]
*  who was the first Israeli American hostage [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=162.32s)]
*  to be released on Saturday. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=164.04s)]
*  Aviva spent 52 days in captivity, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=165.24s)]
*  her husband, Keith, 484 days. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=167.84s)]
*  And I asked her Jose specifically [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=170.92000000000002s)]
*  if she was worried about the fragility of this phase [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=173.32000000000002s)]
*  of the ceasefire and of bringing the hostages home. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  Let's take a listen to what she has to say [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=179.32000000000002s)]
*  and then we'll talk on the other side. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=181.16000000000003s)]
*  I just want to tell President Trump and Bibi Netanyahu [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=185.16000000000003s)]
*  and Hamas, just let them go home. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=189.4s)]
*  Please let them go home. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=193.08s)]
*  They've had enough. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  We've had enough. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=196.08s)]
*  Everybody in this country has had enough. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=198.24s)]
*  And knowing and feeling what it's like [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=200.36s)]
*  and being all sides now, being a hostage, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=204.68s)]
*  being worrying for my husband that was a hostage [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=208.4s)]
*  for 484 days. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=212.0s)]
*  And now that he's released and I'm released in one way, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=216.56s)]
*  knowing what they're going through, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=220.0s)]
*  hell, just please wake up before it's too late. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=222.0s)]
*  So again, we're likely to get the three names tomorrow [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=227.76000000000002s)]
*  if in fact we're moving forward. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=230.36s)]
*  And then the three more hostages released on Saturday. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=232.84s)]
*  The prime minister has said he has a plan for phase two [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=236.20000000000002s)]
*  but has yet to be forthcoming about that plan. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=238.8s)]
*  Those talks likely to resume this weekend [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  when the prime minister returns from the U.S., Jose. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=244.28s)]
*  And hey, Peter, yes, but I just want to, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=248.44s)]
*  because these are things that just, you know, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=250.64000000000001s)]
*  we see them and I was just, I want to go back to the, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=253.32000000000002s)]
*  if I could, the picture that what the prime minister [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=256.20000000000005s)]
*  of Israel gave the president Trump as a visiting president. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=260.08000000000004s)]
*  And you see there in the middle of that tree trunk, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=264.72s)]
*  press with both hands that golden pager. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=269.88000000000005s)]
*  This will remember these pagers, hundreds of them, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=274.72s)]
*  took out essentially the top and middle level [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  organizers of Hezbollah. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=286.40000000000003s)]
*  When these pagers went off, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=289.36s)]
*  many of these Hezbollah members were killed, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=291.08000000000004s)]
*  many were severely injured. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=294.16s)]
*  And then the next day, you know, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=297.44s)]
*  walkie talkies started blowing up. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=300.08000000000004s)]
*  But it's just want to, you know, see that picture again. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=301.88000000000005s)]
*  It's a really significant statement [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=305.16s)]
*  that the prime minister of Israel is making with this gift. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=310.48s)]
*  But Peter, you wrote, quote, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=316.64000000000004s)]
*  when it came to Gaza, Mr. Trump's thinking on Tuesday [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=319.20000000000005s)]
*  was so far outside the box that it was not even clear [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=323.12s)]
*  where he knew there was a box at all. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=327.52000000000004s)]
*  How much of a shift is this [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=330.72s)]
*  and how real of a shift is this? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=332.20000000000005s)]
*  Well, if you take it seriously, it's a dramatic shift. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=336.12s)]
*  It's something no president since the creation of Israel, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=340.32000000000005s)]
*  you know, would have embarked on. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=343.32000000000005s)]
*  Not just the idea of even forcibly, perhaps forcibly, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=345.52s)]
*  but certainly removing the entire [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=349.47999999999996s)]
*  Palestinian population of Gaza, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=351.24s)]
*  but the United States then taking it over as a territory. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=354.0s)]
*  That's what he's talking about here, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=357.03999999999996s)]
*  which is so remarkable because of course, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=358.47999999999996s)]
*  he ran in 2016 on getting us out of the Middle East, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=362.79999999999995s)]
*  of extracting United States from foreign entanglements [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=366.0s)]
*  and criticizing nation building and the Iraq war. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=369.4s)]
*  This would be the biggest, most extraordinary, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=372.12s)]
*  expansive commitment of American treasure and resources [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=374.08s)]
*  that we've seen in quite a few years. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=378.59999999999997s)]
*  Now, he said today in his social media post [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=380.71999999999997s)]
*  that it would not involve US troops. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=383.8s)]
*  That's hard to imagine. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=386.03999999999996s)]
*  How on earth could you hold on to Gaza [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=387.03999999999996s)]
*  where there has been Hamas terrorists for decades [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=391.68s)]
*  without US troops? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=397.68s)]
*  How would you defuse all of the unexploded ordinance [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=398.84s)]
*  that he talked about getting rid of [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=401.91999999999996s)]
*  without US troops? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=403.36s)]
*  You're gonna subcontract that out [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=404.71999999999997s)]
*  to Egyptian and Israeli troops? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=408.36s)]
*  I mean, it's all sort of fuzzy [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=409.71999999999997s)]
*  and not very well thought through, obviously. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=412.0s)]
*  There's been no Defense Department analysis, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=414.8s)]
*  no State Department analysis. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=416.84s)]
*  It's just him talking. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=418.2s)]
*  And we have very few details to actually judge it by. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=419.56s)]
*  And that's why I think people are having a hard time [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=422.76s)]
*  taking it seriously because it seems so fanciful, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=424.2s)]
*  so farcical even. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=426.52s)]
*  And I think that it may be, some people think, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=427.84s)]
*  just his way of getting the conversation going, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=430.92s)]
*  trying to provoke people, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=433.59999999999997s)]
*  because he's not wrong that Gaza is a demolition site. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=435.0s)]
*  He's not wrong that it is a horrific place [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=437.79999999999995s)]
*  for two million people to live right now. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=441.12s)]
*  But even so, many of those two million people [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=443.28s)]
*  don't want to be forced out of their home. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=445.56s)]
*  Yasemin and Sugihan, and Peter Baker, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=449.56s)]
*  thank you both so much. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=451.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiR7wLKRF_g&t=462.96s)]
