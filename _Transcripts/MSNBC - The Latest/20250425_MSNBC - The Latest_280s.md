# 'The Pope of many firsts': Archbishop Wenski reflects on Francis' lasting legacy
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0)
*  Turning now to a live picture at St. Peter's Basilica in the final hours of public viewing for the late Pope Francis. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=0.0s)]
*  In just a little over an hour at 2 p.m. Eastern, his coffin will be closed and sealed in liturgical rite in the presence of several cardinals. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=7.68s)]
*  More than 150,000 people have passed through the Basilica since Wednesday to pay their respects ahead of tomorrow's public funeral mass. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=17.04s)]
*  The Vatican and the city of Rome now preparing for the influx of mourners as the funeral is expected to draw hundreds of thousands. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=25.76s)]
*  One estimate even puts the number at a half million people. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=32.36s)]
*  That includes many foreign dignitaries like President Trump, who left Washington this morning. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=35.88s)]
*  Former President Biden, also a devout Catholic, will be in attendance with former First Lady Jill Biden. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=39.8s)]
*  Joining us now is Archbishop Thomas Wenske of the Archdiocese of Miami. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=46.8s)]
*  Archbishop, it's always a pleasure to see you. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=51.44s)]
*  I know that you were with Pope Francis a number of times. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=54.32s)]
*  What is your takeaway from the experience that you had being by him? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  Well, I remember the first time I met him was in Rome and I had told him that I was from Miami. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=66.6s)]
*  And I told him I was speaking in Spanish to him. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=72.6s)]
*  And I said, and you can see the picture there. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=74.32s)]
*  I said to him, you know, the best thing about Miami is that it is so close to the United States. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  And he laughed pretty well. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=81.80000000000001s)]
*  And of course, we met with him in Rome for the Alimina visit about five years ago. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=84.28s)]
*  I was in Philadelphia when he was for the World Meeting of Families in Washington. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=89.88000000000001s)]
*  I attended the joint session of Congress that he addressed during his visit to the United States at that time. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=95.48s)]
*  And you see a man that was certainly a very human person, a very man, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=103.92s)]
*  uncomfortable in his own skin, and who knew what he wanted. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=111.72s)]
*  And of course, he's the pope of many firsts. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=115.88s)]
*  He was the first Jesuit pope, the first pope from the Americas, the first pope to address a joint session of Congress, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=117.96s)]
*  the first pope that appointed women to high positions in the Vatican, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=124.64s)]
*  positions that had previously been held by cardinals or archbishops. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=128.4s)]
*  So he will be remembered for those firsts, those many firsts that he achieved in his pontificate. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=134.08s)]
*  Yeah, you know, of course, you know, you mentioned this, I mean, one of the first, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=144.08s)]
*  which is the first Latin American pope, you know, from from Argentina. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=148.16s)]
*  And I know that, you know, your diocese is so broad and and I love the Miami is as close to the United States as you can get, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=153.04s)]
*  because it is in many ways an amalgamation of so many rich cultures and people. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=164.16s)]
*  Just today, the president of Mexico released a video that she had by Pope Francis at the Senate tour [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=170.51999999999998s)]
*  with a message to the Mexican people saying how lucky they are that they are Guadalupe in Casa. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=178.8s)]
*  No, I don't get that reality of the Latino American pope gave him a different perspective. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=184.68s)]
*  Wouldn't you say? Oh, yeah. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=194.28s)]
*  But I must must say that for the Mexicans, John Paul II was considered the first Mexican pope. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=196.68s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=204.48s)]
*  That's to Mexico. And he was certainly very much loved by the Mexican people. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=205.6s)]
*  But yeah, having a Latin American pope was an American pope. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  It came from the Americas, from this hemisphere. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=215.56s)]
*  So all of us can kind of include ourselves under that mantle that he was one of us playing an important role on the world stage as a churchman from the South to the global south. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=217.48s)]
*  It's a recognition of the growth of the church and how the church is growing into the South, both Latin America and Africa, Asia. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=231.4s)]
*  And the center of gravity of the church is certainly shifting, shifting away from Europe, from Western Europe and into this hemisphere and to the global south. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=240.72000000000003s)]
*  Archbishop Tomlanswanski, it's always a pleasure. I thank you for your time. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=254.96s)]
*  Thank you. God bless. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=259.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5a877s-fv0&t=261.36s)]
