# Hegseth had unsecured internet line installed at his Pentagon office
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPo-ogAG7GY)
*  First, the defense secretary bypassing the Pentagon's own security protocols with this [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPo-ogAG7GY&t=0.0s)]
*  so-called dirty line. What does that mean exactly? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPo-ogAG7GY&t=5.28s)]
*  Right. It's a line. It's a term that wouldn't be familiar to most people, but it's the Secretary [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPo-ogAG7GY&t=7.68s)]
*  of Defense's office on the third deck, third floor of the Pentagon is a very secure area. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPo-ogAG7GY&t=14.08s)]
*  And for those of us who've covered the Pentagon a long time, we've visited that thing. You have to [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPo-ogAG7GY&t=21.6s)]
*  take your phones out. You can't go in there without phones or other devices. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPo-ogAG7GY&t=26.0s)]
*  This line essentially was installed at his behest to bypass the normal security protocols [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPo-ogAG7GY&t=31.04s)]
*  and the filters for all the other communications lines in this office, where obviously a lot of [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPo-ogAG7GY&t=38.88s)]
*  high-level conversations take place. And so this is in defiance of essential security rules [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPo-ogAG7GY&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  governing that office. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPo-ogAG7GY&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  Do we know why he wanted this line? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPo-ogAG7GY&t=54.64s)]
*  Yeah. As we've seen for the last several weeks, the secretary used his personal phone for [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPo-ogAG7GY&t=57.84s)]
*  the encrypted chat app Signal and relayed sensitive information about military operations on that. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPo-ogAG7GY&t=65.28s)]
*  And this was an ability to get a line into his office so he could use the same chat app [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPo-ogAG7GY&t=74.16s)]
*  on his personal computer. Otherwise, the systems in that office wouldn't allow [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPo-ogAG7GY&t=81.04s)]
*  apps such as Signal, a public app such as Signal, to be used. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPo-ogAG7GY&t=88.16s)]
