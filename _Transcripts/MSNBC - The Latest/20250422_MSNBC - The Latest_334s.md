# Musk eyes the exit after humiliating turn in politics: report
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0)
*  Amid the markets just rejecting everything Trump is doing and sloshing into the muddy [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=0.0s)]
*  depths again today, the automobile company that is owned by the president's top campaign [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=5.54s)]
*  donor, that's doing particularly poorly, even against a market that itself is doing [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=10.42s)]
*  very poorly. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=16.06s)]
*  Here's the journal again tonight. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=18.06s)]
*  Quote, the past few months have been particularly punishing for Tesla, which fell about 5.8 [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=20.18s)]
*  percent today. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=26.48s)]
*  Tesla's shares have plummeted 44 percent in 2025 so far. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=28.14s)]
*  Today Tesla dropped outside the largest 10 U.S. companies by market value for the first [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=32.58s)]
*  time since June 2024. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=37.38s)]
*  Tesla is grappling with slower sales and a damaged brand, with chief executive Elon Musk's [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=39.82s)]
*  prominent role in the Trump administration alienating some customers. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=46.66s)]
*  The company is set to report earnings tomorrow, Tuesday. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=50.74s)]
*  Businesses are expecting a year-over-year drop in Tesla profits. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=55.18s)]
*  The Washington Post reports that Elon Musk may be heading toward the end of his time [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=61.42s)]
*  in Washington. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=66.1s)]
*  That first-corner earnings report that his car company is due to give tomorrow, it does [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=67.9s)]
*  look like it's not going to be good, and that may give him a business excuse that he [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=72.78s)]
*  might be looking for to get out of Washington. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=76.98s)]
*  After all, his time in Washington kind of started bad and has just been scuttling worse [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=80.42s)]
*  and worse all the time. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=85.74s)]
*  His Department of Government Efficiency Doge thing is a mix of embarrassment for its errors [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=88.17999999999999s)]
*  and its palpable confusion, and horror and anger for how much damage it is doing to the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=93.32s)]
*  U.S. government, with really nothing positive to show for itself at all. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=100.02s)]
*  Even if the whole idea of Doge was cutting spending, the Trump administration is spending [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=104.16s)]
*  more on a daily basis than the Biden administration was. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=110.44s)]
*  So even if the whole good idea of Doge is less government spending, it has absolutely [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=113.88s)]
*  failed at that, with Trump spending more than Biden did. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  Musk's cocky assertions about 150-year-olds getting Social Security were immediately debunked [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  and showed him to just not understand the data he was looking at, which is very embarrassing [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=129.98s)]
*  for a man whose whole brand is, look how smart I am. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=134.54s)]
*  Musk's time in Washington has been marked by White House officials snarking anonymously [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=137.17999999999998s)]
*  to the press, like Rolling Stone magazine, about the perception by some in the White [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=141.73999999999998s)]
*  House that Mr. Musk appears to be high all the time, also that he's possibly the most [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=145.44s)]
*  annoying person on the planet. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=151.23999999999998s)]
*  I keep using the word annoying, but the word doesn't do the situation justice. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=152.94s)]
*  Musk apparently tried to get a top-secret briefing from the Pentagon on China war plans [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=158.82000000000002s)]
*  that was promptly reported in the New York Times, which led President Trump to show that [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=163.54000000000002s)]
*  he was both absolutely unaware that his top campaign donor had arranged this for himself. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=167.66000000000003s)]
*  Trump then very quickly made clear that he didn't think something like that should happen, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=173.62s)]
*  and so it was cancelled, and Elon had to eat that, too. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=178.42000000000002s)]
*  Musk then tried to get back into the money and politics game, where he'd done so well, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=182.0s)]
*  getting Trump into the White House in the first place. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=186.74s)]
*  He went very publicly all in with massive spending, ostentatious spending and personal [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=188.74s)]
*  appearances to try to sway the Wisconsin State Supreme Court election. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=195.70000000000002s)]
*  Elon Musk, then lost by double digits in an election that was universally branded as a [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=200.02s)]
*  referendum on Elon Musk. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=206.34s)]
*  Musk then installed his own choice as acting IRS commissioner. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=209.38s)]
*  Treasury Secretary Scott Besant then complained to Trump and uninstalled the guy two days [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=213.14s)]
*  later. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=217.29999999999998s)]
*  Musk then took a loud public stance against Donald Trump's tariffs. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=218.29999999999998s)]
*  Trump has ignored his loud public stance against them and kept the tariffs and all their disastrous [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=222.33999999999997s)]
*  implications, including for Musk's own car company. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=227.7s)]
*  Musk then started a loud public beef with Trump adviser Peter Navarro. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=230.61999999999998s)]
*  Trump decided, quite obviously, to keep Peter Navarro, and we haven't heard much from Elon [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=234.66s)]
*  Musk ever since. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=239.38s)]
*  Now the Washington Post reports this weekend that Elon Musk's signature move in Washington, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=241.46s)]
*  that whole tell me five things you did last week or you'll be fired government email, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=246.62s)]
*  that email goes out sometimes weekly now to government employees, but people just ignore [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=251.26000000000002s)]
*  it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=257.62s)]
*  It's being ignored by multiple, if not most, agencies in the government because Elon Musk [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=258.62s)]
*  no longer really seems to have the juice to do anything about it. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=262.74s)]
*  Musk no longer appears to be running stuff, let alone personally wielding some kind of [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=266.9s)]
*  axe over every government employee in every government agency. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=273.46s)]
*  All of that on top of the massive public revulsion at his role in Donald Trump's administration [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=279.38s)]
*  and in American politics. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=286.78s)]
*  The massive public revulsion for Elon Musk's role in Washington has made the Tesla brand [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=288.76s)]
*  toxic, not to mention his own personal brand. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=294.66s)]
*  So we'll see tomorrow how things go on that Tesla first quarter earnings call. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=300.62s)]
*  We'll see how it goes for Tesla. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=304.90000000000003s)]
*  We'll see how it goes in terms of telling us what's about to happen to Elon Musk and [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=306.86s)]
*  his sojourn in Washington. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgThyIiA8A0&t=310.90000000000003s)]
