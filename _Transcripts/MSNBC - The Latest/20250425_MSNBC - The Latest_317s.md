# Pope Francis leaves behind legacy of elevating women in the Catholic Church
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE)
*  It's a striking scene that captured hearts and headlines worldwide. An 81-year-old French [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=0.0s)]
*  Argentine nun, one of the Pope Francis's oldest friends, approaching his coffin, a restricted [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=6.0s)]
*  area reserved for Catholic cardinals, bishops, and priests. Only men. But no one interrupted her. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=11.92s)]
*  Her emotional moment of personal grief outweighing centuries of protocol. And perhaps an [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=19.04s)]
*  illustration of the historic shift that Francis pioneered to elevate the position of women in the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=25.04s)]
*  church. Joining me now, Elizabeth Love, a Vatican author, historian, and guide. When I saw that, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  I thought, you know, I don't know if anybody had a thought about going over to her, but it's almost [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=37.84s)]
*  like there was this voice saying, don't you dare. Well, it's been a long-standing rule, especially [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=42.72s)]
*  in the square. Never get between a nun and her Pope. They really did like 40 years or something [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=48.8s)]
*  like that. And he had nicknames for her and so on and so forth. But I think that, again, a lot [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=54.72s)]
*  of people are seeing this as an illustration of something that doesn't get talked about as much as [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=60.8s)]
*  other things that Pope Francis did. He elevated women to positions of power. He did. There were [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=66.72s)]
*  some really major changes. But I think it's kind of interesting that his whole pontificate started [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=73.68s)]
*  with the homilies that he would give and Casa Santa Marta always citing his grandmother. So he [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  had this idea of the wisdom of women that we saw was ingrained into his life. And then he began to [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=83.84s)]
*  express that wisdom of women on the world stage by appointing women to these incredibly important [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  positions, whether in art, culture, or really the life of the church. And let's talk about the press [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  because I think he elevated a woman to the number two position in the press office. And Molly Hunter [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=101.84s)]
*  spoke to her deputy director of the Holy See Press Office. Here's what she told us. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=107.84s)]
*  The honor of my life is at the beginning. He did baby steps regarding women, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=114.8s)]
*  top level positions, but there's no way back. Is there no way back? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=122.0s)]
*  Oh, I just, it's going to be great. This is a whole new moment. This is really, we'll see [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=131.36s)]
*  things changing and developing and growing over the course of even the next pontificate. What are [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=136.56s)]
*  we going to do? Say, oh no, no more director of the Vatican museums as a woman, no more governor [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=141.76s)]
*  Toronto as the, as the head of the governor Toronto woman. There's, there is no going back at this [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  point, but this is something that's been evolving anyway from St. John Paul the second, who already [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=151.44s)]
*  began to elevate women, who wrote letters to women. He began to think in terms of how can we make women [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=156.88s)]
*  more part of the life of the church? And Francis, our wonderfully practical hands-on get down, get to [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=163.2s)]
*  business pope, began to look at where can we put women so that they have critical positions [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=169.67999999999998s)]
*  and they share in the governance of this enormous church. But not as priests. There was a little bit [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=175.11999999999998s)]
*  of sort of talk at one point that Francis may be in some of the remote areas where they didn't have [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=181.67999999999998s)]
*  priests. He might consider it that never really happened. So when people say maybe the next pope [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=186.88s)]
*  will allow women to be priests, what do you say? I'm afraid that really would require a whole new [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=195.51999999999998s)]
*  look at how the church is structured and what it means to have Jesus Christ be a man, what it means [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=202.0s)]
*  to have the church be his spouse. So I'm not really, I'm not, I really don't think the church is going [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=208.56s)]
*  to be looking at how to fundamentally change its very internal organic concept of itself [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=214.72s)]
*  in order to change this image and create female priests. We only have a minute left but as I was [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=222.56s)]
*  walking this line and talking to a lot of the young people, the 70,000 who came into town essentially [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=227.28s)]
*  today, so many of them were young women. Do you think though that they will have a chance to [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=232.32s)]
*  change the way the church looks at women in those roles to take the next step beyond what [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=239.12s)]
*  Pope Francis did? I think that women have been changing the way that people look at them all [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=246.24s)]
*  over the world. I mean whether we're looking in secular society or in the church society, we see [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=252.64000000000001s)]
*  women blossoming. This has been a century where women have been able to vote and do extraordinary [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=257.28000000000003s)]
*  things. Those same young women who are feeling this strength, their education, their wisdom, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=261.44s)]
*  their voice, they will bring that into this church and as Catholic women they will find [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=266.88s)]
*  inventive ways to be able to be part of the church, to lead the church in their own individual ways. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=272.64s)]
*  What St. John Paul II called feminine genius and what Pope Francis put into motion by [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=278.56s)]
*  creating these great positions with these wonderful competent women. Well I can see I've walked [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=286.32s)]
*  through the Vatican with you and Ottomans stand up a little straighter when you walk by Elizabeth [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=291.04s)]
*  thank you [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNNkxiFiCrE&t=295.68s)]
