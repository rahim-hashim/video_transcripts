# ‘Hair on fire’: Walz says he’s ‘convinced’ Trump will ignore courts
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng)
*  Joining me now is the 2024 vice presidential candidate governor Tim Walz of Minnesota. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=0.0s)]
*  Governor, you've been out doing these town halls. We just played a clip of one in Lorain, Ohio. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=5.36s)]
*  I'm just curious what you've, what have you encountered there? Anything surprising to you [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=10.48s)]
*  about the vibe out there given that it's 85 days in the new administration, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  very far from campaign season in either direction? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=19.6s)]
*  Yeah, well good to be with you, Chris. Well, I think the biggest thing, I asked at one of these, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=24.0s)]
*  how many folks have never been to a political type of event? And even I was surprised the number of [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=28.0s)]
*  hands went up, nearly half the crowd. So look, the Democrats who are engaged like you're talking [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=33.28s)]
*  about, and I agree with you, a lot of people are going about their daily lives and there's just so [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=38.16s)]
*  much chaos and so many crisis. It doesn't feel like the shift that we know is happening is there. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  I think the thing was encouraging to me is people are picking up on it fast. This is not [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  performative resistance, if you will. This is people really concerned and they're telling their [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=52.88s)]
*  stories that are very personal, whether it's Parkinson's and depending on Medicaid or what's [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=58.160000000000004s)]
*  happening with them at the VA. They're telling those stories in front of their neighbors and [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  it's very raw. It's a lot of emotion, but they're very engaged. So I think the biggest thing, and [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=67.2s)]
*  this was like Martin's Ferry, you know, right across from Wheeling, West Virginia. This is an [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  area that used to be strongly democratic. It flipped the other way, but there were a lot of folks, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=76.56s)]
*  they're saying none of this is what we voted for. None of this is what they talked about. And so I [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=81.04s)]
*  think there is an awakening, if you will, of folks that are really engaging in a way that I quite [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=86.48s)]
*  honestly haven't seen. We've seen big crowds at rallies. This feels different to me. I mean, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=92.72s)]
*  these are Tuesday nights in Lorraine where they've never had one at a high school. They fill the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=97.04s)]
*  auditorium and then they fill the gym. They're not coming to see me. I'm coming to see them. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=101.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=106.56s)]
*  And I think that's what feels different. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=107.04s)]
*  Yeah. Let me follow up on that one thing you said. One of the things I think that's been difficult [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=109.2s)]
*  for a lot of us who sort of do this professionally to navigate, even with people in our lives who are [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=112.72s)]
*  people, educated people, people read the news, people who are, you know, plugged in is just when [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=118.4s)]
*  you're paying attention every moment, it's hard to convey how bad it is what they are trying to do. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=124.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=130.72s)]
*  And then there's this gap, this sort of alienating gap between what their aspirations are, which [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=131.76s)]
*  truly are like apocalyptically bad in my humble opinion. And then just like the fact that we're [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=136.16s)]
*  all, you know, you go get coffee, you pick up a kid, you're on big, like it's normal. And I'm [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=141.12s)]
*  wondering how you sort of are thinking about navigating that as someone who is, you know, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=145.6s)]
*  an elected representative of the people of Minnesota, someone who talks to people and [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=150.64s)]
*  tries to sort of, you know, communicate. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=155.04s)]
*  Yeah. Well, you want to be a calming presence. Look, I've done this through a global pandemic. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=160.24s)]
*  I did it through the unrest of George Floyd. And you want to convey factual information and [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=164.8s)]
*  you want to normalize. Your first segment couldn't have been more spot on. I've been using, and I [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  made this statement at one time, the road to authoritarianism is littered with people telling [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=175.28s)]
*  you you're overreacting. I have had hair on fire for a while, and I know those, you know, we can't [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=179.84s)]
*  swing at everything. He's just out there flooding the zone to distract you from the real stuff he's [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=184.4s)]
*  doing. I have come to understand what Donald Trump, what pops into his head and he says he's [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=189.36s)]
*  going to carry it out. I once again, he talked about the tariffs. He talked about, you know, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=194.96s)]
*  he's going to deport people. And this whole thing with Mr. Abreu Garcia, it's that old wisdom and [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=199.76000000000002s)]
*  terrifying is if you're not speaking up for this man, there will be no one left to speak up for [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=205.52s)]
*  you, whether it's Chris Krebs that they're going after for simply. I know Chris Krebs. He's a [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=210.56s)]
*  Republican. He was there to provide election security in 2020. He did it. And all he said was [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=215.76000000000002s)]
*  it was a fair election. They're coming. They're going to do this. So I think the biggest thing is [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=221.36s)]
*  I'm convinced now he's not going to listen to the courts. And I've been saying there is a finer [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=226.48000000000002s)]
*  firewall and it's the people. That's why these rallies, that's why these town halls, that's why [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=230.88s)]
*  this engagement, it's not meant to scare people. It's meant to empower people because I will tell [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=236.0s)]
*  you what, Republican members of Congress are not afraid of the people. They're afraid of Donald [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=241.04s)]
*  Trump. They are starting to become afraid of the people. That's why they're not doing these town [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=246.4s)]
*  halls. They need to be afraid and come forward. I was a member of Congress. You need to stand in [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=250.79999999999998s)]
*  front of them and say, why gutting the VA makes sense? Why did you allow an unelected official [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=255.51999999999998s)]
*  like Elon Musk be able to take away Social Security, to be able to get that data? So I think [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=260.48s)]
*  what's happening, Chris, is that it's not about terrifying people. It's about just simply and very [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=266.32s)]
*  calmly showing them they are headed towards this. Donald Trump has said it. He terrifies me as he [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=272.0s)]
*  has talked in the past about nuclear war being winnable. He thinks the tariffs, and you think [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=278.88s)]
*  that's terrifying? Look what he talks about. And if he says it, he plans on doing it. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=283.76s)]
*  Yeah, just to clarify, and I know you mean this because of the times we live in, you mean [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=288.64s)]
*  politically afraid of the people as opposed to physically afraid of the people, which is [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  an important distinction given the world we live in. I know you mean that. I just want to be very [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=296.24s)]
*  clear about that. Well, yeah, I appreciate you clarifying that because I will guarantee you that [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=302.0s)]
*  clip is already on Fox News to try and say the radicalness is coming from the Democrats. It's [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=307.04s)]
*  being afraid of the people speaking their mind to them. They're afraid of the voters voting them out [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=312.24s)]
*  because they voted for these bad things. But they are more terrified that Donald Trump will say [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=317.6s)]
*  something about them or primaring them. And I don't know what it is about these people clinging [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=322.88s)]
*  to these jobs. The job of a congressman is a privilege, but it ain't the greatest job in the [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=327.68s)]
*  world. And I don't know why you're giving up your dignity, the responsibility you have to hold that [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=332.0s)]
*  job. But you're right. They think that they can disrespect the voters. And that's the feeling I [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=337.04s)]
*  got in these town halls. Don't disrespect us. Come and ask questions. And just to be clear, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=342.32s)]
*  I did one in Texas and there was a gentleman there that was he was opposed to vaccines. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=347.12s)]
*  He stood up and asked his question and said that. And I responded that, you know, the research shows [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=352.64000000000004s)]
*  that you've got measles in Texas, we should be addressing them. But it's not these are folks that [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=357.68s)]
*  just want to be heard, even though their issues weren't agreeing with mine. So I don't know, this [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=362.64000000000004s)]
*  is the time to do this. I'm going to thank all the people who are out there, all the people. And you [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=367.44s)]
*  just had Senator Van Hollen, who there's nobody better. He has to speak up for his constituents [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=371.68s)]
*  because they do plan if they think they can get away with this, they will press it further. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=377.91999999999996s)]
*  You've given some interviews about the twenty twenty four campaign and I think all of us have a [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=384.0s)]
*  kind of things are so bad right now that allergy to like too much retroactive, you know, thinking. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=388.32s)]
*  But I did want to follow up on one thing where you talked about some of the mistakes you thought the [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=395.44s)]
*  campaign made. One of them was sort of failing in outreach to Latino voters, which I think is [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=399.03999999999996s)]
*  borne out by the data, not speaking enough, just being a little too cautious, which I think I agree [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=406.48s)]
*  with, too. You talked about the unpopular stance of the Biden administration on Gaza. And I wonder [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=412.32s)]
*  just I want to just ask about whether you think that that campaign, the Harris Wells campaign, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=418.16s)]
*  should have made a more decisive substantive policy break with the with the administration's [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=422.72s)]
*  policy on Gaza. Look, I think retroactively, Chris, you can you could put it into more of a context. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=427.6s)]
*  I think going back to July and watching when decisions were being made so quickly, the question [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=433.76s)]
*  was, would there be, you know, would there be a primary time? Didn't have it. The threat was real. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=438.15999999999997s)]
*  I think being able to clearly articulate, as I think the vice president was was doing wonderfully [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=443.92s)]
*  around things like home care for using Medicare or or making sure we're investing in homeownership, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=449.03999999999996s)]
*  we could have been clear that there was a different agenda going forward. I think the time [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=455.12s)]
*  crunch made it difficult. And I think in a change election, it was difficult to show that [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=459.12s)]
*  there was a differentiation. But what I know now is and again, that this is not all that surprising, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=463.84000000000003s)]
*  but this is the consequence of not winning an election. And I think your point about [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=471.2s)]
*  and I do agree with this. I think you have to flood the zone. I think the Republicans dominating [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=475.44s)]
*  the media environments that are, you know, adjacent to what we're normally used to, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=480.32s)]
*  we've got to be out there. And I think it's worth taking a risk to misspeak. I think it's worth it [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=485.36s)]
*  to take questions unscripted, on screen, standing in front of people because I think they're hungry [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=491.36s)]
*  for that. And I think Vice President Harris, her presence in those moments, I watched it, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=496.88s)]
*  she is winning folks over. Just do more of it. In that spirit very quickly here, but on the Gaza [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=501.68s)]
*  question, should there have been a more definitive break with with the administration on Gaza [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=507.28000000000003s)]
*  specifically? Well, I think we would have been clearer because the Harris administration wouldn't [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=511.6s)]
*  have us in the situation we are now. Nothing has gotten better. The situation with Donald Trump of [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=516.48s)]
*  stumping on that. We could have been in a different place. That wasn't believed by a large number of [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=521.52s)]
*  people. But I think it's clear now. And what I would say is we still need to have a two state [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=526.5600000000001s)]
*  solution. We still need to bring priests to Gaza. We still need self-determination for the [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=530.5600000000001s)]
*  Palestinians and Israel's needs to write for its security. Those processes haven't changed. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=534.64s)]
*  Donald Trump's doing none of that. Governor Tim Walz, thank you for making time with us. I appreciate it. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbT7NFAfng&t=539.52s)]
