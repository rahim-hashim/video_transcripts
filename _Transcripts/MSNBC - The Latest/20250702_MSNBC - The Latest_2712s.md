# See Bryan Kohberger plead GUILTY for murder of Idaho college students
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [July 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk)
*  All right, this is CR 012431 665. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=0.0s)]
*  Defendant is present in custody with counsel Miss Thompson, Miss Jennings, and pardon me, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=10.88s)]
*  Miss Taylor, Miss Massoff, and Miss Barlow. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=17.44s)]
*  The state's present with Mr. Thompson, Mr. Horowitz, Miss Jennings, and Mr. Nye is here as well. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=20.36s)]
*  Am I missing anybody? I'm sorry. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=36.36s)]
*  Miss Allen is here as well. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=39.16s)]
*  Miss Allen is here as well. Very well, thank you. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=40.36s)]
*  All right, we are here today to entertain a change of plea. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=43.16s)]
*  Before I start, I want to address some issues of concern and otherwise. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=48.6s)]
*  First, I appreciate everybody in attendance today being on their best behavior. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=58.36s)]
*  Please no outbursts or demonstrations. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=64.2s)]
*  Any such conduct will result in immediate removal and may result in an inability to attend further court proceedings in this case. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=67.08s)]
*  I want to point out that there have been calls by some for the public to contact me and my office in an attempt to influence my decision making in this case. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=79.0s)]
*  This has been extraordinarily disruptive for court staff and the ability for them to get work done, not only in this case, but in other cases where defendants are entitled to [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=91.16s)]
*  have their cases processed and frankly, as important, if not more so for victims to have their cases processed in those cases. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=107.32s)]
*  It's also highly inappropriate. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=118.11999999999999s)]
*  The court is not supposed to and this court will never take into account public sentiment in making an opinion regarding its judicial decisions in cases. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=121.24s)]
*  Courts should and I always will make decisions based on where the facts and the law lead me. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=137.72s)]
*  I have not read any of the numerous messages nor listened to any of the numerous voicemails that have been sent to me and my staff. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=145.4s)]
*  Those have all been forward to security and where appropriate to law enforcement. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=154.68s)]
*  I ask that you not continue to mount such campaigns or to send me information like this because again, it is not appropriate and frankly not something I would take into account [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=159.88s)]
*  when deciding a matter in a case like this. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=173.16s)]
*  I also want people to understand some very basic concepts about the ideas of separation of powers, what the court's duties are and what the duties and the rights of the executive or in this case, the prosecuting attorney is. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=179.96s)]
*  The executive, the elected prosecutor is the sole authority in deciding what charges to pursue, including whether as well as what penalties to ask for and what penalties to pursue, including the death penalty. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=195.16s)]
*  This court cannot require the prosecutor to seek the death penalty nor would it be appropriate for this court to attempt to do that. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=217.16s)]
*  This court in considering a plea agreement, if it were to reject this plea agreement, cannot force the state to seek the death penalty. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=227.0s)]
*  My role and power in considering a plea agreement is extremely limited. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=238.2s)]
*  My role is to ensure that the defendant's plea is given freely, voluntarily and intelligently. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=242.2s)]
*  If those things are met, I can only reject a plea such as the one in this case where I'm not being asked to agree to the sentence in advance. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=248.2s)]
*  If those things are met, I can only reject a plea such as the one in this case where I'm not being asked to agree to the sentence in advance. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=258.2s)]
*  If I can only reject it, for example, if the defendant does not meet or admit to all of the elements of the crime. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=268.2s)]
*  That is, I can ensure what is called a factual basis to the plea. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=280.2s)]
*  Finally, I want to offer my apologies to all the families, including the victim's families, the families of the defendant, for the short notice for today's hearing and I'm sure what must have been the hurried efforts to get here. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=288.2s)]
*  I, like most everyone else, learned of this plea agreement Monday afternoon and had no inkling of it beforehand. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=306.2s)]
*  Prior to that time, I was under the belief that this case was proceeding to trial as had been indicated and my staff and I were busy continuing to work on preparations to have potentially 10,000 citizens of Ada County come to jury duty starting in mid-July. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=318.2s)]
*  With the questionnaire process in mid-July. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=337.2s)]
*  It was, once I learned of the defendant's decision to change his plea in this case, it was important that I take the plea as soon as possible because of the extraordinary administrative efforts that were otherwise attendant to the process of this, getting this trial potentially underway on time. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=343.2s)]
*  And including the significant process of bringing, again, potentially up to 10,000 jurors to come in and fill out juror questionnaires prior to the beginning of the voir dire process. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=366.2s)]
*  And so it was important that we, if we're going to go down this road, do so expeditiously so that we can avoid those costs and expenses associated with that. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=378.2s)]
*  Otherwise, if it was not going to result in a plea or for some reason the plea were to fall through today that we could continue diligently towards trial at the time specified. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=398.2s)]
*  And so that obviously required that we act quickly and so some folks may have not had the amount of time that we would otherwise allow for for them to travel here. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=410.2s)]
*  And so again, I apologize for that. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=425.2s)]
*  I want to make people aware that during the hearing, if you are to leave the courtroom for any reason, you will not be readmitted during the hearing. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=428.2s)]
*  Also, when we finished the hearing this morning, I asked that the public and media wait in their seats until the victim's families and the defendant's families and others are escorted out of the courtroom before you start to leave. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=441.2s)]
*  Finally, I want to acknowledge the trial court administrator and her staff, the Ada County Sheriff and Ada County 4th District Marshal Service for the huge lift that they've accomplished in preparing for and orchestrating this hearing today, as well as to all the security attendent today that you see and some of whom you, many of whom you don't see, with less than 48 hours notice. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=458.2s)]
*  And so I appreciate the hard work that they've been doing. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=484.2s)]
*  Frankly, some of them, while they were on some vacation prior to the trial starting and had to call that short. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=488.2s)]
*  And so I appreciate very much their professionalism and dedication. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=494.2s)]
*  All right. That said, let's move to the business of today. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=500.2s)]
*  I understand the state and the defense have reached a plea agreement in this case. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=506.2s)]
*  For the record, I have a written plea agreement, which indicates in some. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=515.2s)]
*  The defendant will plead guilty to all five counts in the indictment, burglary, felony, and first degree murder, four counts. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=523.2s)]
*  The state and the defendant stipulate that is that the defense is not free to argue for a lesser sentence at sentencing to the following. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=535.2s)]
*  The defendant on the burglary charge will be sentenced to 10 years fixed. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=546.2s)]
*  And that the defendant on counts two through five, the four counts of first degree homicide on each count would receive a fixed life sentence. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=551.2s)]
*  All five of those counts to run consecutive to one another. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=559.2s)]
*  Defendant as part of the plea agreement waives his right to appeal. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=564.2s)]
*  As well as his right to appeal the sentence and his right to seek leniency or reconsideration of the sentence under Idaho Criminal Rule 35. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=570.2s)]
*  This is not a rule of an agreement, meaning the court is not bound by the plea agreement and could impose a different lawful sentence at sentencing. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=579.2s)]
*  The stipulated agreement between the parties is the maximum on each count. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=592.2s)]
*  So theoretically, the only thing the court could do would be a lesser sentence at sentencing. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=596.2s)]
*  But the defendant is not free to ask the court to do so under the plea agreement. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=601.2s)]
*  Are there any other material terms of the plea agreement that the parties would like to make? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=606.2s)]
*  Obviously the plea agreement, the written plea agreement will speak for itself, will be part of the court record. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=610.2s)]
*  Not from the state, Your Honor. Thank you. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=615.2s)]
*  No, Your Honor. Thank you. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=618.2s)]
*  All right. Very well. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=619.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=626.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=627.2s)]
*  Miss Taylor, have you had sufficient time to discuss this case and all of its ramifications with your client? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=630.2s)]
*  I have, Your Honor. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=641.2s)]
*  Have you discussed fully with him his rights, defenses, and possible consequences to him of the guilty plea? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=642.2s)]
*  Yes, Your Honor. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=648.2s)]
*  Have you been able to do all the discovery you feel necessary? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=649.2s)]
*  Yes, Your Honor. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=652.2s)]
*  And have you informed your client of the importance of providing the court truthful and accurate answers in taking this plea today? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=653.2s)]
*  I have. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=660.2s)]
*  Have you apprised your client of any and all offers and counter offers and answered his questions about those? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=662.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=667.2s)]
*  Do you consent to the entry of the plea today? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=668.2s)]
*  I do. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=669.2s)]
*  All right. Mr. Koberger, I need to ask you some questions this afternoon, or I guess it's this morning still. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=671.2s)]
*  I do this to ensure that you understand, so that I am assured that you understand the nature of the charges to which I understand you're going to plead guilty as well as the possible consequences to you of your guilty pleas. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=677.2s)]
*  I want to make sure your plea is given voluntarily, and I want to make sure that you actually committed the crimes to which you're pleading guilty, because I don't want you to plead guilty to a crime you didn't commit. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=689.2s)]
*  If you attempt to plead guilty today, but for some reason they don't accept your plea, then it is possible that your statements today could be used against you later at trial. Do you understand that? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=700.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=711.2s)]
*  All right. Thank you. And while you're standing, actually, why don't you take the oath from the clerk? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=712.2s)]
*  Questions today. Have you consumed substance? Questions. Let me ask you, have you consumed any alcohol, drug, or other intoxicating substance that would impair your ability to understand or exercise restraint? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=729.2s)]
*  No. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=757.2s)]
*  You feel like you are thinking clearly today? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=758.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=760.2s)]
*  All right. I want you to understand what the possible penalties are for each of the crimes to which I understand you're going to offer a guilty plea today. They include on count one, the burglary, a fine of up to $50,000, and a period of incarceration of up to 10 years in the state penitentiary. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=761.2s)]
*  You may be required to pay restitution to any victims of the crime. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=780.2s)]
*  Count two, three, four, and five for first degree murder. The consequences include a fine of up to $50,000, a period of incarceration of life imprisonment, which is a requirement of a sentence, that it be a life sentence with a mandatory minimum sentence of at least 10 years. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=785.2s)]
*  On each of those counts. In addition, you would be potentially responsible for a fine of up to $5,000 to each of the victims of your crime to be enforced in the form of a civil judgment, to operate as additional punishment. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=809.2s)]
*  This is in excess of any restitution or fines that the court could order. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=830.2s)]
*  And again, you may be required to pay restitution to the victims of the crime. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=836.2s)]
*  You would be required to provide as to counts one, two, three, four, and five, a DNA sample and a right thumbprint impression and potentially pay for analysis of those samples. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=841.2s)]
*  You would lose any right to possess purchase or carry a firearm, the right to serve on jury duty, the right to hold public office and the right to vote. Do you understand the charges and all those possible consequences? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=852.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=863.2s)]
*  You've heard the plea agreement that I talked about today. Do you agree with that plea agreement? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=874.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=879.2s)]
*  And do you understand the nature of the charges that you've been charged with that I understand you're going to plead guilty today too? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=880.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=890.2s)]
*  As I indicated, I'm not bound by the plea agreement, but the plea agreement is for the maximum on each count. Do you understand that I'm not bound by the plea agreement? [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=891.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=906.2s)]
*  Has anyone promised you that I would be lenient or easy on you if you plead guilty? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=907.2s)]
*  No. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=912.2s)]
*  Has anyone threatened you or anyone close to you to get you to plead guilty? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=913.2s)]
*  No. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=917.2s)]
*  Has anyone other than the state's agreements with respect to the plea agreement, has anyone promised you anything in exchange for your plea agreement? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=918.2s)]
*  No. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=927.2s)]
*  Has anyone told you to be untruthful in answering my questions today? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=929.2s)]
*  No. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=933.2s)]
*  Has anyone offered you a reward of any kind other than the plea agreement in order to get you to plead guilty today? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=937.2s)]

*  Yes. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1137.2s)]

*  Yes. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1145.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1147.2s)]
*  I want you to understand what the state would have had to have proven at trial had you, to the crimes that you're pleading guilty to, had you, if you didn't plead guilty. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1148.2s)]
*  Let me find the document. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1163.2s)]
*  Hang on a second here. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1164.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1165.2s)]
*  So as to count one, Burghley, the state would have to have proven that honor about November 13, 2022 in Laetah County, Idaho, you unlawfully entered a residence located at 1122 King Road in Moscow, Idaho, with the intent to commit the felony crime of murder. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1176.2s)]
*  As to count two, the state would have had to have proven that honor about that same date in Laetah County, Idaho, you did willfully, unlawfully, deliberately, with premeditation and malice of forethought, kill and murder Madison Mogan, a human being, by stabbing Madison Mogan from which she died. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1197.2s)]
*  As to count three, the state would have had to have proven that on that same date in Laetah County at that same address, you did willfully, unlawfully, deliberately, with premeditation and malice of forethought, kill and murder Kaylee Gonzalez, a human being, by stabbing her from which she died. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1219.2s)]
*  As to count four, the state would have had to have proven that honor about that same date in Laetah County, Idaho, you did willfully, unlawfully, deliberately, with premeditation and malice of forethought, kill and murder Zana Cronodal, a human being, by stabbing her from which she died. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1239.2s)]
*  And then as to count five, also murder in the first degree that honor about November 13th, 2022, pardon me, in Laetah County, Idaho, you did willfully, unlawfully, deliberately, with premeditation and malice of forethought, kill and murder Ethan Chapin, a human being, by stabbing him from which he died. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1256.2s)]
*  Do you understand those things the state would have had to have proven? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1277.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1280.2s)]
*  Do you understand that by pleading guilty the state no longer has to prove those things because you're admitting those things are true? [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1281.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1287.2s)]
*  I want to also make for the record, the defendant has provided with the guilty plea advisory form a document entitled Written Factual Basis that purports to have the defendant's signature on the record. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1289.2s)]
*  It purports to have the defendant's signature dated 1 July 2025. Did you sign that document? [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1317.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1323.2s)]
*  And did you agree with the Written Factual Basis that is included there? [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1324.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1327.2s)]
*  And then let me ask you, did you, on November 13th, 2022, enter the residence at 1122 King Road in Moscow, Idaho with the intent to commit the felony crime of murder? [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1336.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1350.2s)]
*  Did you, on November 13th, 2022, in Laetaw County, state of Idaho, kill and murder Madison Mogan, a human being? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1352.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1366.2s)]
*  And did you do that willfully, unlawfully, deliberately, and with premeditation and malice of forethought? [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1367.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1373.2s)]
*  Did you honor about that same date in Moscow, Idaho, kill and murder Kaylee Gonzalves, a human being? [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1375.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1383.2s)]
*  And did you do that willfully, unlawfully, deliberately, and with premeditation and malice of forethought? [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1384.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1390.2s)]
*  And did you, on that same date in Moscow, Idaho, kill and murder Zana Kernodle, a human being? [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1392.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1399.2s)]
*  And did you do that willfully, unlawfully, deliberately, with premeditation and malice of forethought? [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1400.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1405.2s)]
*  And then on, or about November 13th, 2022, again in Laetaw County, Idaho, did you kill and murder Ethan Chapin, a human being? [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1407.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1417.2s)]
*  Did you do that willfully, unlawfully, deliberately, with premeditation and malice of forethought? [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1418.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1423.2s)]
*  I would ask the state at this time to provide its recitation of its factual basis had this case gone to trial. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1425.2s)]
*  Thank you, Your Honor. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1433.2s)]
*  Your Honor, the organization of the recitation is different than what I think the court and the public may be familiar with from the probable cause affidavit and other documents. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1435.2s)]
*  The state's evidence as an overview would show that back in March of 2022, when the defendant was residing at his parents' residence or residing back in Pennsylvania, his home state, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1444.2s)]
*  he purchased online a K-Bar knife and sheath with an Amazon gift card that he had purchased shortly prior to the purchase of the knife, sheath, and sharpener. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1456.2s)]
*  Jumping ahead, the end of June of that year, the defendant, Mr. Coburger, moved from Pennsylvania to Pullman, Washington, which is right across the state line from Moscow, Idaho, for the purpose of pursuing a Ph.D. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1466.2s)]
*  in criminal justice at Washington State University. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1480.2s)]
*  The state's evidence would indicate that beginning July 9th of 2022, Mr. Coburger's phone began connecting to a cell tower that serves the area of the 1122 King Road residence in Moscow, Idaho. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1484.2s)]
*  Now, I will acknowledge for the court and all present that there are many residences in that area. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1499.2s)]
*  It's a dense population of mostly college-related occupants. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1504.2s)]
*  Between July 9th of 2022 and November 7th, the defendant's phone connected to that particular tower during late night, early morning hours, 10 p.m. to 4 a.m., on approximately 23 times. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1510.2s)]
*  Now, I will acknowledge also we do not have evidence that the defendant had direct contact with 1122 or with residents of 1122, but we can put his phone in that area on those times. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1526.2s)]
*  In the interim, on August 22nd of 2022, Laetaw County Sheriff's Deputy Darren Duke conducted a traffic stop in the early morning hour or late evening hours, about 11 p.m., on the west side of Moscow on the Moscow-Pullman Road. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1539.2s)]
*  This was the traffic stop of Mr. Coburger's car, which turned out to be a 2015 white Hyundai Elantra with Pennsylvania plates. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1556.2s)]
*  During the course of the traffic stop, Deputy Duke was able to obtain Mr. Coburger's name, Brian Coburger, his phone number and his address, which at that point was an apartment address in Pullman. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1566.2s)]
*  We then moved to the early morning hours of November 13th, 2022. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1580.2s)]
*  The state's evidence would show that early morning hours on that day, Mr. Coburger's phone left his Pullman residence, which is an apartment in kind of the north central northwest part of Pullman. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1588.2s)]
*  That phone was then subsequently turned off at approximately 2.54 a.m. and remained off until approximately 4.48 a.m. on Sunday, the 13th of November. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1601.2s)]
*  The state's evidence would include a trial, bitty surveillance of a business on the Moscow-Pullman Highway just across the state line from Moscow. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1615.2s)]
*  It would show a vehicle matching the description of the defendant's Hyundai Elantra entering Moscow at approximately 3.02 a.m. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1628.2s)]
*  Compiled surveillance that the investigators put together from businesses and residents then show the defendant's car, the white Elantra, as I've described, circling the 1122 King Road area, that neighborhood, starting around 3.30 or so in the morning. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1637.2s)]
*  Comes into the immediate area of the 1122 King Road, which is actually on a dead end, and then leaves several times. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1657.2s)]
*  The state's evidence would show that the defendant's car came back and parked behind and above the 1122 King Road residence. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1665.2s)]
*  The state believes that its evidence would then show that the defendant entered the residence of 1122 through the kitchen sliding door on the backside of the residence, which is the side of the residence that would face the area above where the defendant's car was parked. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1689.2s)]
*  The defendant entered the residence, went to the third floor, and with a knife killed Madison Mogan and Kayla Gitzalves. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1708.2s)]
*  The defendant, as he left that room, for whatever reason, ended up leaving or the sheath for a K-Bar knife was left on the bed next to Madison Mogan's body. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1720.2s)]
*  And I can jump ahead. That sheath was tested by the Idaho State Police Forensic Lab, and single source male DNA was found on the snap of that sheath, as well as blood from both Kaylee and Madison and other trace evidence. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1732.2s)]
*  But it's important to note single source male DNA was on the snap of that sheath. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1747.2s)]
*  The state's evidence would show that Zana Knodel was still awake at this time. In fact, had taken a door dash order not long before this started. Her room was not on the third floor. It was on the second floor on the west side. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1755.2s)]
*  As the defendant was either coming down the stairs or leaving, he encountered Zana and he ended up killing her also with a large knife. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1770.2s)]
*  Ethan Chapin, Zana's boyfriend, was asleep in their bedroom, in her bedroom, and the defendant killed him as well with a large fixed-bed knife. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1782.2s)]
*  Each victim suffered multiple wounds. I will state for the record that there is no evidence there was any sexual component or sexual assault on any of the victims. I want to make that clear so there's no speculation. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1792.2s)]
*  There were two other roommates in the house, and they were already asleep. During the course of this, one of those roommates awoke, looked out her door not knowing what was going on, and saw the defendant who was dressed in black with a black belt and a cove on, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1804.2s)]
*  holding some sort of container in his hand. And she saw him leave the house through the direction of the kitchen where that sliding door is that I mentioned before. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1821.2s)]
*  At approximately 420 that morning, so this would have been 15 minutes or so later, the defendant's car is seen on a surveillance camera for 1112 King Road, which is immediately next door to the west of 1122, leaving the area at a high rate of speed. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1831.2s)]
*  And if the court were to see that, or anybody in this courtroom would see that, you can see the car almost loses control as it makes the coroner heads north and then turns to go south on Walenta, which is one of the only ways to get out of that part of town. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1856.2s)]
*  The evidence would show that following that, the defendant in his Elantra drove south of Moscow. We know that he drove on the back roads because there are surveillance cameras on the main highways, Highway 95, that would have picked up the defendant's car if he'd gone that route, and they did not show the defendant's car on that route during the time. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1871.2s)]
*  So we know that he went through a variety of back roads, a very rural, isolated part of Latah County. About 448 that morning, the defendant's phone comes back on. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1894.2s)]
*  And the evidence will show that that phone was located south of Moscow, likely at a side road intersection with Highway 95. From there, the defendant's phone activity tracks heading back north towards Pullman, Washington, where the defendant lived. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1907.2s)]
*  About 526, starting approximately 526, various surveillance cameras in Pullman, Washington pick up the defendant's vehicle as he enters Pullman from the south and heads north and slightly west towards his apartment where he arrived approximately 530 in the morning. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1927.2s)]
*  Later that morning, still this Sunday, the 13th of November of 2022, Mr. Koberger's phone returned to the area of King Road. We don't know exactly what he did, but it returned to that area. It's about nine o'clock in the morning. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1948.2s)]
*  He was there for about 10 minutes and then returned to his Pullman residence. About 930, the state's evidence will show, evidence taken from the defendant's phone, that he took a selfie of himself on his phone in what appears to be the bathroom of his Pullman apartment with a thumbs up. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1963.2s)]
*  The defendant's phone then went to the Lewiston-Quarston Valley, approximately 30 miles south of Moscow in Pullman, and the defendant is actually seen with his car at various businesses down there. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1983.2s)]
*  This area is the confluence of the Clearwater River and the Snake River. Lewiston is Idaho's seaport, large bodies of moving water down there. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=1998.2s)]
*  In addition to tracing the defendant's activities, as I've just outlined on the 13th and leading up to the 13th, the state's evidence will show that following Sunday, November 13th, 2022, business records show that the defendant began searching for a K-bar knife and K-bar knife sheath, as the state believes, to replace the one that was left at the scene of the murders. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2010.2s)]
*  The evidence also will suggest that there were at least attempts by the defendant to delete or alter his purchase history on Amazon, where all these transactions had occurred. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2038.2s)]
*  Later that week, the state's evidence would show that Mr. Koberger went to what we would call DMV, motor vehicle licensing here in Idaho, in Pullman to change his car registration from Pennsylvania to Washington. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2049.2s)]
*  That's of note because Pennsylvania cars do not require a front license plate. The vehicle seen on the surveillance cameras of the defendant's car showed it didn't have a front license plate on it. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2066.2s)]
*  At the time of the traffic stop by Deputy Duke in August, Pennsylvania plate, no front license plate. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2078.2s)]
*  Mr. Koberger proceeded to finish his semester of studies at Washington State University and returned to Pennsylvania for the holidays. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2088.2s)]
*  Law enforcement at this point were aware of Mr. Koberger, had been accessing information about him, were trying to find him. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2098.2s)]
*  They located him in Pennsylvania and they conducted what's called a trash pull during the nighttime hours. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2106.2s)]
*  Agents of the FBI, who assisted immensely with this case, working with the sanitation department back in this neighborhood in Pennsylvania, took trash that had been set out on the street for collection, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2114.2s)]
*  sent the contents of that from the Pennsylvania residence of the defendant's parents to the Idaho State Forensic Laboratory, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2128.2s)]
*  where the lab experts there were able to identify DNA on a Q-tip as coming from the father of the person whose DNA was found on the knife sheath that was next to Madison Mogin's body in the bed. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2138.2s)]
*  Subsequently, an arrest warrant was issued here in Idaho and a search warrant was issued in the state of Pennsylvania with the assistance not only of the FBI, but the Pennsylvania State Police. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2156.2s)]
*  Mr. Koberger was arrested at his parents' home to return to Idaho. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2167.2s)]
*  Upon his return to Idaho, a DNA sample was taken from him and it matched the DNA found on the knife sheath next to Maddie's body at the crime scene. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2171.2s)]
*  I can tell the court and the public the weapon itself, the knife, has not yet been recovered. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2183.2s)]
*  I can tell the court that the defendant's apartment in Pullman was searched as well as his office. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2190.2s)]
*  Spartan would be a kind characterization. There was virtually nothing there. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2197.2s)]
*  Nothing of evidentiary value was found. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2201.2s)]
*  And of course, we are now talking six, eight weeks after the time of the killings. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2204.2s)]
*  In Pennsylvania, the defendant's car was seized and it was actually pretty much disassembled internally. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2210.2s)]
*  And it also had been cleaned. There was a bucket of cleaner right beside it. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2215.2s)]
*  I think we can all look to our own cars, you know, in those compartments in the doors. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2220.2s)]
*  You can try to keep them clean where you put stuff. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2226.2s)]
*  There's always some degree of crud in there. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2229.2s)]
*  They were spotless. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2231.2s)]
*  The defendant's car had been meticulously cleaned inside. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2232.2s)]
*  And the state would present to the jury that that was part of the defendant's plan in covering up this. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2236.2s)]
*  The defendant has studied crime. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2244.2s)]
*  In fact, he did a detailed paper on crime scene processing when he was working on his pre-doctorate degrees. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2246.2s)]
*  And he had that knowledge and skill. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2254.2s)]
*  So, Your Honor, at the end, the state submits the evidence that I've given just a quick overview of [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2256.2s)]
*  and that presenting court would consume weeks, which the state is prepared to do and has been prepared to do, [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2263.2s)]
*  would show that as the defendant has just admitted and pleaded guilty on November 13th, 2022. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2269.2s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2275.2s)]
*  Mr. Koberger entered the residence of 1122 King Road in Moscow, Idaho. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2281.2s)]
*  He did that with the intent to kill. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2286.2s)]
*  We will not represent that he intended to commit all of the murders that he did that night, [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2289.2s)]
*  but we know that that is what resulted and that he then killed intentionally, willfully, deliberately with premeditation and with malice or thought. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2294.2s)]
*  Maddie Mogen, Kayleigh Gonzales, Ethan Chapin, and Santa Cruz. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2306.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2314.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2315.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2319.2s)]
*  Based on the state's proffer and, importantly, based upon defendant's explicit admission to committing these crimes, [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2325.2s)]
*  the court finds there is a factual basis. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2334.2s)]
*  Therefore, with respect to Count 1 burglary felony, how do you plead, Mr. Koberger, guilty or not guilty? [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2336.2s)]
*  Guilty. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2343.2s)]
*  As to Count 2, murder in the first degree as it relates to the murder of Madison Mogen, how do you plead, guilty or not guilty? [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2344.2s)]
*  Guilty. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2353.2s)]
*  As to Count 3, as it relates to murder in the first degree for the murder of Kayleigh Gonzales, how do you plead, guilty or not guilty? [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2354.2s)]
*  Guilty. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2360.2s)]
*  As to Count 4, the first degree murder of Zana Cronodal, a human being, how do you plead, guilty or not guilty? [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2361.2s)]
*  Guilty. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2370.2s)]
*  As to Count 5, the first degree murder of Ethan Chapin, a human being, how do you plead, guilty or not guilty? [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2371.2s)]
*  Guilty. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2378.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2379.2s)]
*  The court will find that the defendant understands the nature of the charges and each offense and the possible consequences to him of his guilty plea. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2380.2s)]
*  The court finds that there is a factual basis for the plea and finds the defendant believes the plea to be in his best interest. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2392.2s)]
*  I find the plea was given freely, voluntarily and was intelligently made. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2398.2s)]
*  I accept the plea. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2402.2s)]
*  I direct that it be entered. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2403.2s)]
*  I'll continue the matter for sentencing in this case. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2405.2s)]
*  I think it was mentioned on the call Monday afternoon the defense wishes to waive a pretrial investigation. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2408.2s)]
*  Is that accurate? [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2416.2s)]
*  Yes, Your Honor. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2417.2s)]
*  State also? [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2418.2s)]
*  Yes, Your Honor. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2421.2s)]
*  The state does not believe a pre-sentence investigation is needed given the evidence that is available. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2422.2s)]
*  We want to, though, make sure that all of the victims have the opportunity to make statements to the court at sentencing. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2426.2s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2432.2s)]
*  And certainly both the state and the defense may present whatever sentencing memorandum and other documents you wish me to consider. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2433.2s)]
*  The victims will be given an opportunity to provide the statements that they wish to at sentencing. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2446.2s)]
*  Do we need more than one full day for sentencing? [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2453.2s)]
*  I do not believe so, Your Honor. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2456.2s)]
*  Obviously we have numerous victims and we have victims who share unique perspectives on this and we want to make sure that they all have time to express their feelings to the court. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2459.2s)]
*  But I believe that if we can start perhaps 830 or so in the morning that we should be able to complete it all in one day. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2472.2s)]
*  Defense agree with that in terms of the time frame? [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2480.2s)]
*  Yes, Your Honor. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2484.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2486.2s)]
*  So as it happens, we have some time reserved in this case in July and August. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2488.2s)]
*  The week of July 22nd is available. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2496.2s)]
*  I don't know if that's too soon for the parties or the next week, the week of August 4 is available. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2499.2s)]
*  Any preference? [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2507.2s)]
*  Your Honor, we're prepared as soon as the court wants to schedule it. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2509.2s)]
*  The state I believe would be prepared on the 22nd. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2513.2s)]
*  We've told the victims' families that we're looking at approximately those dates. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2515.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2519.2s)]
*  So because of the plan to bring in so many jurors to fill out questionnaires, I had ordered that no other trials could take place in this courthouse the week of July 22nd. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2520.2s)]
*  And so we will use that in terms of the sentencing date because of what I'm sure will be the significant interest of the media and the public and the logistics that will be required to make that happen. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2535.2s)]
*  Without trials going, it'll be a lot easier to do that. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2553.2s)]
*  So let's pick that week. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2555.2s)]
*  Why don't we pick July 23rd with the idea that if for some reason we don't finish, we could continue into the 24th. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2557.2s)]
*  We'll start at nine in the morning. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2566.2s)]
*  Does that give your team enough time, Sandra? Nine in the morning? [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2571.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2574.2s)]
*  Any concerns with that date? [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2576.2s)]
*  No, Your Honor, thank you. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2578.2s)]
*  No, sir. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2580.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2581.2s)]
*  Any reason why I should not rescind the non-dissemination order at this time? [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2586.2s)]
*  Your Honor, I think that given the history of this case, it would be best if that remained in place through sentencing. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2591.2s)]
*  So we have time to make sure there's the ability to completely answer questions. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2598.2s)]
*  That would be the state's preference and recommendation. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2606.2s)]
*  We'd have no objection for the order to remain in place. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2610.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2613.2s)]
*  I will at this point, the idea to keep it until sentencing, which time it would be withdrawn in order to give the parties the space and time to prepare to meet what I'm sure will be the deluge of media requests. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2614.2s)]
*  That's at least my preliminary decision at this point. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2637.2s)]
*  I can always revisit if it seems to be for some reason I should. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2641.2s)]
*  That said, obviously, I don't think the defendant, a bond was ever set for the defendant where it would be revoked. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2648.2s)]
*  The prior order allowing him to come in civilian clothes is revoked, given his plea and no longer the presumption of innocence. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2659.2s)]
*  And in fact, now the actual conviction for the crimes, he will continue to be held at the jail pending sentencing. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2666.2s)]
*  Is there anything else today? [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2674.2s)]
*  No, Your Honor. Thank you. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2676.2s)]
*  I assume the trial date will be vacated and the four jurors will be released. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2679.2s)]
*  The trial will be vacated and I'm sure that the jury commissioner will get word to those that receive their summons that they won't be required to attend. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrhnYp7LKk&t=2683.2s)]
