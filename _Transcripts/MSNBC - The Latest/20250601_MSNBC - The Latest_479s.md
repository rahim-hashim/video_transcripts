# Michael Cohen: I would 'selfishly' accept a pardon from President Trump
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ)
*  It's been one year since Donald Trump became the first former president in U.S. history [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=0.0s)]
*  to be convicted of a felony. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=6.08s)]
*  A jury of 12 New Yorkers convicted Trump for falsifying business records as part of an [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=8.18s)]
*  alleged hush money scheme to influence the 2016 election. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=13.34s)]
*  Several months later, he won the 2024 election, as we all know, and made history as the first [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=17.82s)]
*  convicted felon elected to the Oval Office. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=23.72s)]
*  And now he's taking steps to protect other allies convicted of their own white collar [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=26.82s)]
*  crimes. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=31.740000000000002s)]
*  This past week, Trump sent out a blitz of pardons and commutations, including to those [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=32.74s)]
*  who have expressed political support or echoed the president in claiming that they too had [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=37.620000000000005s)]
*  been unfairly targeted. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=42.58s)]
*  Michael Cohen is back with us now. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=45.1s)]
*  So Michael, you pled guilty to a charge related to your campaign finance violations that you [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=48.14s)]
*  say were at Trump's behest. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=56.94s)]
*  Here's what you told our colleague, Chris Hayes, back in January about asking for a [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=61.5s)]
*  pardon from Biden. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=65.58s)]
*  Let's take a listen. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=67.26s)]
*  My hope is that Joe Biden offers and presents me with the same pardon that he did for his [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=69.1s)]
*  own son. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=74.22s)]
*  I think there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=75.3s)]
*  Biden obviously, Biden obviously did not offer you a pardon. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=79.3s)]
*  If Trump were to have a change of heart, would you accept a pardon from him? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=84.14s)]
*  You know, selfishly, I would simply because it would make my life a little easier going [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=88.26s)]
*  back into real estate, dealing with banks and so on. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=95.56s)]
*  But it's not going to change my life. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=98.58s)]
*  My more concern, and coming out on Monday in The Hill, there's an op-ed on exactly [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=101.62s)]
*  this myself with Jesse Jackson Jr. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=106.54s)]
*  On making certain statements in regard to what we believe took place with this Biden [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=109.42s)]
*  administration. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=116.78s)]
*  I don't discount what Trump said about the group of individuals that were around him, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=117.94s)]
*  protecting him. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=122.62s)]
*  I don't believe that he even saw my application. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=123.62s)]
*  I had seven well-known individuals who wrote letters of support, two members of Congress, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=126.38s)]
*  two historical individuals, two of the most senior constitutional law professors and an [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=132.82s)]
*  ambassador ethics czar. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=141.14s)]
*  All wrote letters of support. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=143.34s)]
*  I didn't even get a response. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=145.54s)]
*  So I, yes, would like to have received from Joe Biden the same type of a document that [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=147.26s)]
*  they gave to Joe Biden's son, Hunter, and the rest of the Biden family. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=154.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=159.06s)]
*  And I also am concerned about the 70 million Americans, 70 million that are basically scarlet [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=160.06s)]
*  lettered for the rest of their life as felon. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=168.98000000000002s)]
*  Well, what if your sentence like mine was 36 months? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=171.98000000000002s)]
*  I did. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=176.5s)]
*  I did my time. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=177.5s)]
*  I paid all the restitution even before sentencing. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=178.78s)]
*  I owe no money. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=182.42000000000002s)]
*  It was nonviolent. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=183.82s)]
*  Why should I be a felon for life? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=185.05999999999997s)]
*  That's not the way the system should work. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=187.29999999999998s)]
*  Would you ask for a pardon from Trump? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=189.66s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=191.17999999999998s)]
*  Do you have his phone number? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=192.17999999999998s)]
*  I'll give him a call. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=193.17999999999998s)]
*  No, I mean, I don't think the old cell number that I have still works. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=194.17999999999998s)]
*  But you talk a lot about like people going to kiss the ring and he has that power over [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=195.94s)]
*  people. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=199.38s)]
*  And so he's able to exploit that power to his advantage, whether it be an individual [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=200.38s)]
*  who wants to get his life back on track or whether it is somebody, a billionaire who [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=203.38s)]
*  wants to get pardon. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=207.33999999999997s)]
*  So I think Trump uses his leverage. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=208.45999999999998s)]
*  Would you go to him or would you message him and say to him in one way or the other, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=212.34s)]
*  I would like a pardon? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=217.54s)]
*  Not just for me only. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=219.34s)]
*  I don't want it as an individual. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=221.18s)]
*  I want it on behalf of the 70 million Americans and their families that are all afflicted [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=223.42000000000002s)]
*  by the fact that they have felony convictions. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=228.98000000000002s)]
*  They can't get housing. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=231.98000000000002s)]
*  They can't get bank accounts. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=233.62s)]
*  You can't get credit cards and so on. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=235.14000000000001s)]
*  So I have, again, working with Jesse Jackson Jr., we've been working on a policy that we [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=237.3s)]
*  believe would be like from the hand of God, which is what the president's power that's [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=243.34s)]
*  granted to him in the Constitution. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=248.96s)]
*  So when you look at the list of people, though, who have received pardons and commutations [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=249.96s)]
*  in recent days and weeks, what do you make of the pattern that's emerging here, though? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=254.34s)]
*  Some of them are really bad individuals. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=260.5s)]
*  are also caught up in white collar, you know, tax issues. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=263.98s)]
*  And yeah, I agree with the tax issues, the nonviolent, but there are several who, let's [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=267.46s)]
*  just say, stole over a billion dollars, paid back $100 million and now received a pardon. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=273.46s)]
*  Many people would turn and say, yeah, it doesn't sound like the worst idea, right? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=283.62s)]
*  And what happened back in the first term to the goal of using pardons in large part for [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=286.42s)]
*  a form of criminal justice reform. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=292.1s)]
*  I mean, he was meeting with Van Jones and others and, you know, it was in part a way [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=294.5s)]
*  for him to actually reach out to black and Latino voters. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=300.02000000000004s)]
*  That does not seem to be his focus this time around. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=303.54s)]
*  Well, that's why when Eamonn asked me if I would accept the part under the circumstance [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=306.3s)]
*  that he invoked the policy that we have written, which again would be like the hand of God, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=311.66s)]
*  and it would then it would be bigger even than the Emancipation Proclamation. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=318.86s)]
*  And in that fact, that numbers wise, it would affect 70 million Americans. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=323.42s)]
*  That's a nice swath of this country. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=329.06s)]
*  I do want to clarify that Trump has not only reserved his largesse and mercy for white [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=331.38s)]
*  collar criminals. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=337.74s)]
*  He was also asked about pardoning the people involved, for example, in the 2020 kidnapping [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=338.86s)]
*  plot against Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=342.44s)]
*  I want to play what he said and how Gretchen Whitmer responded. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=345.86s)]
*  I'm going to look at it. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=348.86s)]
*  I will take a look at it. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=352.02000000000004s)]
*  It's been brought to my attention. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=353.74s)]
*  I did watch the trial. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=355.26s)]
*  It looked to me like somewhat of a railroad job. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=357.5s)]
*  I'll be honest with you. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=359.78000000000003s)]
*  It looked to me like some people said some stupid things, you know, they were drinking. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=360.78000000000003s)]
*  And I think they said stupid things. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=364.54s)]
*  Very disappointed that they're even considering it, frankly. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=366.38s)]
*  You know, when the president was shot out in Pennsylvania, I was one of the first people [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=369.3s)]
*  on either side of the aisle to condemn it. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=374.62s)]
*  We have to condemn political violence, no matter where it comes from, no matter who [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=378.34000000000003s)]
*  it's aimed at. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=381.58s)]
*  What message do you think this sends to Trump supporters? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=383.34000000000003s)]
*  It's a terrible message. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=385.94s)]
*  It's a terrible message to America. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=387.32s)]
*  You know, it's hard to get into the mind of MAGA. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=388.98s)]
*  I don't even want to try to go there. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=391.38s)]
*  It's a terrible message to send to America that you can actually plot to take out a governor, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=394.02s)]
*  take out a politician, to take out anybody. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=399.14s)]
*  The president of the United States is contemplating on issuing pardons. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=402.5s)]
*  The same thing should be as insulting as those people who he pardoned for January 6th, no [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=409.02s)]
*  longer calling them insurrectionists, now they're to be referred to only as defendants. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=416.46s)]
*  Let me ask you really quickly before we go, and we're almost out of time, because I did [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=422.06s)]
*  ask you about the pardon, but I want to ask you the other side of it. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=424.54s)]
*  Are you afraid that you might be targeted? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=426.78s)]
*  Donald Trump has made clear he wants to go after his enemies. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=428.34000000000003s)]
*  You've got Cash Patel, Don Ben Gino, both who have attacked you in the past for going after [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=430.74s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=435.38s)]
*  They are now in very powerful positions. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=436.38s)]
*  Are you afraid they may target you? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJm_85NFTOQ&t=437.7s)]
