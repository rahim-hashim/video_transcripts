# 'All dictators smash universities': Professor who left country over Trump policies
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI)
*  Let's talk more about President Trump's actions against universities and international students. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=0.0s)]
*  Jason Stanley is a fascism expert and professor at the University of Toronto. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=4.8s)]
*  He recently left his post at Yale in protest of the Trump administration's actions. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=10.08s)]
*  Good to have you with us. Professor Harvard has been the most vocal about opposing President [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  Trump's demands for universities, and so that school has also faced the most what appears to [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=19.68s)]
*  be retribution. Has Harvard's approach been effective in your view? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=24.32s)]
*  Well, it's not a matter of being effective. It's the only possible approach. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=30.4s)]
*  They're going to smash the universities. All dictators smash universities. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=34.56s)]
*  Well, the alternative is capitulation. It's agreeing to the terms that the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=39.2s)]
*  administration lays out, which we saw with universities like Columbia. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=43.04s)]
*  Yeah, Columbia's had three presidents in 12 months. Nothing like this has ever happened in [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=47.44s)]
*  U.S. history. So Columbia is barely—the last president, the president who capitulated, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=52.8s)]
*  Katrina Armstrong, was fired immediately as soon as she said that it wasn't going to be as extreme [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=60.4s)]
*  as the terms suggested. So universities can—I mean, you know, Russia has universities, I suppose. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=67.67999999999999s)]
*  Harvard could be a university in Russia. But, you know, I mean, they're going to try to stuff [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=76.64s)]
*  universities with Trump supporters, and the main thing is they want to show that they own [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=81.6s)]
*  the universities, that the main authority is the dictator. And when you have these great universities, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=86.8s)]
*  the United States had the greatest university system in the world, that's a threat to the authority [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  of the dictator, and that's a threat to the glory of the dictator, right? I mean, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=100.88s)]
*  when people around the world think of the United States, they think of Harvard. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=106.96s)]
*  Not Trump. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=111.6s)]
*  Well, and you talk about the attack on the university as a whole, but why do you think [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=113.19999999999999s)]
*  the administration has made such a big show of targeting international students? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  Well, everyone comes to the United—everyone in the world comes to the United States to study [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=124.16s)]
*  at our great universities. There's no other country like it. They're the crown jewel, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=131.6s)]
*  really, of this country. So if you want to crush that aspect of America, if you want to crush that [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=136.48s)]
*  aspect of our greatness, you target that. You say, you know, we're no longer a place where you can [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=143.51999999999998s)]
*  come for freedom. And people come to America for freedom. So my parents came from fascism [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=151.12s)]
*  in Europe to freedom. Think about what you're saying when you're saying that international [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=158.0s)]
*  students must bend their knees to American greatness. That's not freedom. So this attack, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=163.12s)]
*  the specificity of this attack that's saying international students cannot have freedom of [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=171.76s)]
*  speech, cannot have freedom of thought ever, and then taking away international students says [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=178.4s)]
*  Harvard is no longer or our universities are no longer internationally great. So you're literally [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=185.12s)]
*  telling the world these are no longer international institutions. They're like— [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=192.4s)]
*  It would seem like counterproductive for somebody who wants to be great, known as being great. What [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=199.12s)]
*  do you make of the extra social media screening plan by this administration? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=205.6s)]
*  Well, it's an attack on freedom, which any authoritarian government does. So, you know, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=210.8s)]
*  and as you said earlier in this program, you first say, oh, you're going after criminals, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=217.92s)]
*  but then now you're going after the freedom of thought, the freedom of speech of international [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=225.6s)]
*  students, students who come to our country to enjoy those freedoms. That's why they come to [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  our country rather than going to universities in their home countries. So when you attack [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=236.48s)]
*  their freedoms, you're attacking freedom itself. You're attacking the connection [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=244.08s)]
*  between America and freedom. And what we're supposed to replace it to with is saluting the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=249.20000000000002s)]
*  flag and Donald Trump. The public face of Trump's immigration agenda has been what he's dubbed the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  border czar, Tom Homan. And he was on Fox last night boasting about the lack of constraints on [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=261.04s)]
*  this White House. Listen. Well, remember just a couple of weeks ago, AOC went on social media [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=267.12s)]
*  saying if we put a finger on any of our coworkers, the Congress people that were at our Newark [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=274.4s)]
*  facility, there'd be consequences. Well, guess what? We did it. I'm waiting on the consequences. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=280.4s)]
*  In a way, he's right. The courts have only minimally stopped their immigration actions. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=287.12s)]
*  The Republican-led Congress has been subservient. So what is the backstop? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=291.04s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think there are if you understand how authoritarianism works and how dictatorships [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=294.72s)]
*  work, there are no backstops. We're heading into a situation where the Proust universities, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  the democratic institutions are in existential peril. The legal system is going to try to defend [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=312.56s)]
*  itself. It seems to be the last backstop here. They're targeting opposition politicians, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=318.8s)]
*  as dictatorships always do. So they've targeted a congresswoman who entered that ICE facility, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=324.64s)]
*  charging her with assault. This is all playbook stuff. And it's really difficult to see [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=330.64s)]
*  how the United States is going to roll back dictatorship, essentially. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=337.92s)]
*  Jason Stanley, conversation to be continued. Thank you very much for sharing your expertise [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=343.68s)]
*  and your perspective on all of this. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFX5FijCbI&t=348.88s)]
