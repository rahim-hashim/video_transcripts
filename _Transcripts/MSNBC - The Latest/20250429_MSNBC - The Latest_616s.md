# 'Uncertainty': One word to describe Trump's economic agenda after 100 days
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0)
*  And look at the clock. We are closing out on day 100 of the second Trump administration. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=0.0s)]
*  Thus far, we have seen the president test the limits of executive authority, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=5.68s)]
*  attack institutions, overhaul immigration, and upend the global economy, all in the span of 100 [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=9.6s)]
*  days. And I want to start with the economy. Wall Street largely backed Donald Trump because [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=16.88s)]
*  they were thinking more about what he did in his first term than what he promised to do in his [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=20.96s)]
*  second. Now that he's in office, of course, they are shocked to realize he meant what he said on [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=25.44s)]
*  the trail. Tariffs have become his top economic priority, sending markets into complete turmoil, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=29.84s)]
*  tumbling or skyrocketing off a single tweet of his. In just over three months, he's broken our [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=35.84s)]
*  oldest and closest trade alliances and put in jeopardy our unique position as the global [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=42.08s)]
*  economic superpower. The result could send the United States into a recession. None of this [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=47.92s)]
*  should be a surprise. Donald Trump has been praising tariffs for over 40 years, but the back [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=53.28s)]
*  and forth, on again, off again, back again nature of this trade war rollout has only led to confusion [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=58.4s)]
*  and paralysis for big businesses and small. What CEO would make a five-year investment to build a [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  massive new factory when it's unclear if the tariffs are even happening two months from now? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=70.64s)]
*  And while we are focused on Trump's first 100 days, we also need to devote at least some attention [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=75.52s)]
*  over to Congress. They passed a total of five laws, and with each passing day, they've allowed [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  the president to usurp their power and give unprecedented access and control to the world's [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=86.56s)]
*  richest man who has gained an unknown quantity of our personal and private information. This power [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=92.56s)]
*  was given to Elon Musk all in the name of DOGE, or Department of Government Efficiency, an acronym, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=99.2s)]
*  but it's also a joke, named after Musk's meme coin featuring a Shiba Inu dog. Thousands of jobs [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=104.72s)]
*  lost, programs canceled, and suspended aid for an effort named after a joke. But the stated goal of [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=111.52s)]
*  joke, that's a very serious business, to cut out government waste, fraud, and abuse. Musk promised [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=117.92s)]
*  to cut two trillion dollars from the budget, but then look what happened. I think we can do at least [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=124.08s)]
*  two trillion. I think we'll try for two trillion. I think that's like the best case outcome, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=130.8s)]
*  but I do think that you kind of have to have some overage. I think if we try for two trillion, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=138.32s)]
*  we've got a good shot at getting one. We can actually find a trillion dollars in savings. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=143.2s)]
*  That would be roughly 15 percent of the seven trillion dollar budget. I'm excited to announce [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=148.32s)]
*  that we anticipate savings in FY26 from reduction of waste and fraud by 150 billion dollars. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=153.28s)]
*  From two trillion down to 150 billion. Now I would not kick 150 billion bucks out of bed, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=160.4s)]
*  but here's the thing. We don't even know if it's real. There are no receipts, no accountability [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=168.24s)]
*  for 92 billion dollars of it. When it comes to numbers, the most concrete thing we've heard from [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=174.08s)]
*  Muskworld was his announcement to refocus his attention on Tesla and away from DOGE after his [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  car company's lousy, lousy earnings report. And keep in mind, DOGE might end up costing the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=186.0s)]
*  government about the same amount Musk claims he saved or cost us even more. Just one example, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=192.24s)]
*  the cuts at the IRS have led to more than 20,000 employees leaving and resulting in an eight and [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=198.64s)]
*  a half billion dollar loss in revenue. But there is great work to be done. I actually wish that [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=204.88s)]
*  DOGE was a collaboration between our greatest technology companies in the United States of [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=213.68s)]
*  America. We've got the best and the federal government to make the government actually [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=218.16s)]
*  more efficient and technologically advanced. Instead, it has been slash and burn, a mass [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=222.56s)]
*  restructuring without a new structure. That is why this 100-day milestone will be marked by my [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=228.72s)]
*  team doing an MSNBC town hall this Thursday night at 9 p.m. Eastern. Our audience will also be our [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  guests, federal workers forced out of their jobs. Many who are working to make the government more [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=243.04s)]
*  efficient and save taxpayers money have all been fired by DOGE. In the past 100 days, Donald Trump [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=248.4s)]
*  has accomplished a tremendous amount. Nobody would argue that, just not in the ways many, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=254.72s)]
*  many people expected. All right, let's get smarter with the help of our leadoff panel tonight. Jeff [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=260.71999999999997s)]
*  Mason joins us, White House correspondent for Reuters. Leanne Caldwell, chief Washington [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=265.36s)]
*  correspondent for PUC. And Peter Goodman, global economics correspondent for the New York Times. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=269.28s)]
*  Jeff, you had the high honor. You were with President Trump in Michigan today as he was [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=274.08s)]
*  marking his first 100 days back in office. The economy and tariffs have clearly been a top issue. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=278.32s)]
*  What was your takeaway from the president's remarks today? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=284.88s)]
*  Jeff, number one, he was doing a rally. It was the first rally that he's done since becoming [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=290.4s)]
*  president, since coming into office. And it's definitely his sweet spot. He did his greatest [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=295.28s)]
*  hits of things that he really cares about, both rhetorically and from a policy perspective. One [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=300.88s)]
*  thing that stood out to me at the rally, to your question, is he did pause in the middle of it to [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=307.2s)]
*  show a very sort of slickly produced video about migrants and alleged gang members that the [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=312.71999999999997s)]
*  Trump administration has removed from the country. And there was music in the background and the [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=322.0s)]
*  crowd cheered. That was definitely produced for a kind of victory lap of sorts that is what he was [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=326.88s)]
*  doing at this rally. I think broadly, though, your opening was spot on. This president has upended [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=335.76s)]
*  so many things in the first 100 days of his term. And as officials told us last week ahead of this [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=342.88s)]
*  anniversary, he's just getting started. Peter, the president, while in Michigan, did scale back [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=349.52s)]
*  tariffs on automakers today. It is the latest carve out, right? We have talked about this from [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=356.79999999999995s)]
*  the get go. This is why Donald Trump likes the tariffs. It makes him the kingmaker. You get a [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=361.76s)]
*  carve out. You don't get a carve out. What would it look like if these auto companies didn't get [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=366.96s)]
*  the carve out? I'm thinking back to what it was like for them in 2008, 2009, digging out of the [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=372.24s)]
*  financial crisis. And what about all the other industries that don't have the lobbying efforts [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=377.36s)]
*  the auto industry does who can't get to Trump and get the carve out? Well, even if you do get the [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=382.16s)]
*  carve out, I mean, to your point earlier, there's so much uncertainty around these tariffs going [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=386.56s)]
*  forward that to take out the checkbook and talk about spending, you know, tens, hundreds of millions [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=391.68s)]
*  of dollars to set up a factory, which is ostensibly what these tariffs are designed to do, you know, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=396.72s)]
*  to give you the sense that there's no safe harbor except here in the United States. Well, it's just [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=401.28000000000003s)]
*  not going to work if you've got this exemption game coupled with changes to tariff policy in [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=405.2s)]
*  reaction to, you know, who's up and who's down, who's got the loyalty of the president at any [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=412.0s)]
*  given moment. So, you know, this rollback, and we're not really sure what the details are. There's a [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=417.52s)]
*  lot of vague areas. It's an admission implicitly that we've gone too far and we've jeopardized [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=423.28s)]
*  jobs that are already here in the name of supposedly bringing jobs back. Leanne, take us [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=432.88s)]
*  to Republican-led Congress. When they look back on the last hundred days, where do they think, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=438.24s)]
*  how would they assess things? So, Steph, I spent most of today talking to Republican members of [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=444.24s)]
*  Congress asking them this question specifically, and you might be shocked to hear that they have [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=450.64s)]
*  nothing bad to say about Donald Trump, President Trump, in his first hundred days. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=458.72s)]
*  Yes, they are a little bit nervous with the markets. They're a little bit nervous of where [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=465.68s)]
*  this goes, but for the most part, they're saying, look, trust the process. This is going to be good [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=472.08000000000004s)]
*  in the long run. And so Republicans left a pep rally. They had a pep rally this morning, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=478.96000000000004s)]
*  political pep rally, talking about the House map, how they're going to do in the midterm elections, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=486.0s)]
*  the state of politics right now. And that was an attempt to unify the party and make sure that they [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=493.36s)]
*  are comfortable with where things are. And so they left that totally on message, on point. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=503.52s)]
*  Even privately, they were reluctant to say anything negative to the president. I was talking to a [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=509.68s)]
*  political operative today who said, of course, this is completely predictable. They've all decided [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=515.12s)]
*  that they are going to stick with Trump. They're either going to rise with him or they're going to [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=520.8s)]
*  go down on the ship with him. Jeff, one of the very first things that Donald Trump did [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=524.64s)]
*  in this second term was pardon the January 6th defendants. So shouldn't we be surprised, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=530.5600000000001s)]
*  but all that came after that, shouldn't that have been a new level set for all of us? Like [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=537.2s)]
*  this is a whole new ballgame? I was in the Oval Office that night and he signed a slew of executive [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=541.76s)]
*  orders, including the ones that you just mentioned, Steph, pardoning all of the January 6th defendants. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=551.68s)]
*  And that particular move was controversial within his own party and even amongst some of his own [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=559.6s)]
*  advisors. But you don't hear anybody talking about that now. I mean, that's ancient history in terms [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=566.4s)]
*  of the things that have been on the list that he has struck off during the first 100 days that he's [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=571.92s)]
*  been in office. But that's one that I think I'm kind of glad you brought it up because I think it's [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=579.68s)]
*  really, really notable one and a really important one that deserves to continue to be on people's [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=585.1999999999999s)]
*  minds because listen, that was very, very controversial. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBLldP5unO0&t=591.44s)]
