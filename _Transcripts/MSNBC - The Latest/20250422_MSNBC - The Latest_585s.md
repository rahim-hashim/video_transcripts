# 'Double standard' for Secretary of Defense to be 'a national security risk': Sykes
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw)
*  We're back with an exclusive about Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's handling of sensitive [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=0.0s)]
*  information concerning U.S. military operations in Yemen. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  Three U.S. officials with direct knowledge tell NBC News the leader of U.S. Central Command [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=8.96s)]
*  had transmitted the plan to Hegseth over a secure government system. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=14.52s)]
*  And then, within minutes, Hegseth was using his personal phone to send the information [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=19.76s)]
*  to two signal group chats. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=24.44s)]
*  One of them included his wife and brother. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=26.78s)]
*  Joining us now, NBC News senior national security correspondent Courtney Qubey, Charlie Sykes, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  MSNBC contributor and columnist, and Sabrina Singh, former deputy press secretary at the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=34.44s)]
*  Pentagon. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=39.68s)]
*  So, Courtney, what are we hearing from the defense secretary about all of this? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=40.68s)]
*  Well, we heard a little bit from him on Fox News this morning. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=44.839999999999996s)]
*  We have not spoken to him or seen him ourselves today, but he addressed this second story [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=48.72s)]
*  broken by the New York Times over the weekend and confirmed by NBC News that, in fact, as [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  you mentioned, Chris, he started a signal chat, added family members, including his [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=57.16s)]
*  wife and his brother and some of his friends, including his personal attorney, and then [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=62.04s)]
*  he chatted with them. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=66.52s)]
*  He added, he chatted with them, he texted them specific information about a U.S. military [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=67.8s)]
*  operation against the Houthis. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=73.8s)]
*  He addressed those allegations today, and as he did yesterday, he blamed both the media [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=75.52s)]
*  and people who were recently fired from here at the Pentagon for this information getting [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=80.4s)]
*  out. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=84.47999999999999s)]
*  Here's what he had to say. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=85.47999999999999s)]
*  What was shared over Signal then and now, however you characterize it, was informal, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=88.16s)]
*  unclassified coordinations for media coordination and other things. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=94.16s)]
*  That's what I've said from the beginning. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  We take the classification of information very important. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=99.6s)]
*  It's very significant to us that we safeguard it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=103.96s)]
*  And that's one of the similar talking points that we heard the first time that we had reporting [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=109.1s)]
*  from the Atlantic about a Signal group that was created by National Security Advisor Mike [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=112.36s)]
*  Waltz and included the Secretary of Defense where he also texted to these individuals. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=116.74s)]
*  In this case, it was senior administration officials about an imminent strike and action [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=121.82s)]
*  against the Houthi rebels in Yemen. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=127.14s)]
*  But what is clear here, according to our new reporting from our colleague Gordon Lubold [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=129.82s)]
*  and I, is that in fact the information that Secretary Hegseth was texting in these unclassified [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=133.78s)]
*  Signal chats came directly from the commanding general of U.S. Central Command, General Eric [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=140.7s)]
*  Carrillo. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=146.46s)]
*  General Carrillo sent that information over a classified system. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=147.46s)]
*  Secretary Hegseth turned around and within literally within minutes was sending it on [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=151.02s)]
*  an unclassified system, that Signal app, Chris. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=155.3s)]
*  Thank you so much for that Courtney. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=160.98000000000002s)]
*  So Sabrina, as someone who's worked inside the Pentagon, how closely guarded is this [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=162.46s)]
*  kind of information sent by the leader of CENTCOM? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=167.26000000000002s)]
*  I mean simply put, this is classified information and that's why the commander of Central Command [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=171.14000000000001s)]
*  sent it on a classified system of what's being reported and to have the Secretary of Defense, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=176.45999999999998s)]
*  you know, no less than 10 minutes later type up that classified information and put it [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=181.94s)]
*  into, you know, sending probably from his personal phone into both chats, it's incredibly [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=186.7s)]
*  concerning, it's incredibly dangerous because that is information that pertains to an operation [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=193.29999999999998s)]
*  that hadn't yet begun and what he did was he put at risk the lives of our fighter pilots [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=198.17999999999998s)]
*  that were in the air about to conduct that operation and our sailors of course that are [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=203.58s)]
*  in the Red Sea about to launch some of those missiles towards those Houthi controlled areas [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=207.5s)]
*  in Yemen. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=212.94s)]
*  So Sabrina, let me play for you what Hegseth said today about these comments and what he [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=215.58s)]
*  called leaks coming out of the Defense Department. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=219.82s)]
*  When we had leaks, which we have had here, we did a serious leak investigation and through [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=225.42000000000002s)]
*  that leak investigation, unfortunately, we found some folks that we believe were not [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=230.38s)]
*  holding to the protocols that we hold dear here at the Defense Department. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=235.94s)]
*  Through that investigation, they have been moved on. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=240.18s)]
*  Those folks who were leaking, who have been pushed out of the building are now attempting [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=242.74s)]
*  to leak and sabotage the President's agenda and what we're doing. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=246.82s)]
*  He's talking about pretty heavy turnover at the Defense Department this past week, including [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=251.66s)]
*  three of his own aides who were ousted in a leak investigation. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=255.57999999999998s)]
*  Is there a double standard here? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=259.74s)]
*  I think it's pretty clear that there's a double standard. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=262.34000000000003s)]
*  I mean, if in fact those aides that have been ousted by the Secretary of Defense did leak [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=263.98s)]
*  unclassified or unauthorized information out, you know, they absolutely should be held accountable. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=269.06s)]
*  The Secretary of Defense himself did the exact same thing that he's accusing his aides of [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=275.3s)]
*  doing. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=279.74s)]
*  I mean, he put classified information about an operation into two signal chats and yet [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=280.74s)]
*  there has been no accountability for the Secretary of Defense. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=285.06s)]
*  And just one more thing on this. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=288.02s)]
*  In that Fox interview, the Secretary went on to say that he's constantly being briefed [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=290.18s)]
*  on war plans and operational plans. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=294.26s)]
*  Well, it's then very concerning if he's constantly being briefed on the plans that we are conducting [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=296.18s)]
*  all around the world, that he doesn't understand how concerning and dangerous the information [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=301.14s)]
*  that he put in those signal chats is for our fighters overseas. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=306.06s)]
*  So, Charlie, Congressman Don Bacon has become the first Republican lawmaker to suggest that [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=310.21999999999997s)]
*  the president should fire Hegseth. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=316.3s)]
*  In fact, he told NBC News in a text message, and I'm quoting here, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=317.86s)]
*  If the reports were true regarding Secretary Hegseth, it is unacceptable and I wouldn't [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=321.86s)]
*  tolerate it if I was responsible. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=327.21999999999997s)]
*  I should say that that congressman is a former Air Force general who chairs an armed services [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=330.18s)]
*  subcommittee that focuses on cyber issues, so he comes at this with a bit of credibility. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=335.62s)]
*  Do you think his comments could have any ripple effect among Republicans? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=340.38s)]
*  Well, I imagine that there are also Republican senators who were pushed into voting to confirm [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=345.26s)]
*  Pete Hegseth, who are unhappy with the way that that has turned out. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=350.82s)]
*  But ultimately, what it comes down to is, does Donald Trump want to keep Pete Hegseth? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=356.1s)]
*  Look, in a normal, rational political universe, he never would have gotten this job, he never [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=360.7s)]
*  would have been confirmed, and he would not survive this. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=365.7s)]
*  The double standard is ridiculous. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=368.06s)]
*  To have the secretary of defense be a national security risk presiding over the kind of chaos [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=370.1s)]
*  that he is presiding over, he would be gone. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=375.82000000000005s)]
*  But we are not living in that universe, and it comes down to simply, does Donald Trump, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=379.26000000000005s)]
*  is he going to get, is he going to draw the line and say, no, I want to keep him? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=384.78000000000003s)]
*  Now, right now, it looks like MAGA is circling the wagons around Hegseth, but one gets a [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=388.22s)]
*  sense with this guy, there are always more shoes to drop, and the fact that so many of [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=394.06s)]
*  the calls are coming from within the House, the fact that his former spokesman has written [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=398.06s)]
*  that scathing article in Politico Magazine talking about just the absolute mess in the [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=402.38s)]
*  Pentagon, ought to be sending alarm bells all through the White House. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=410.1s)]
*  But again, it doesn't matter, this is Donald Trump's choice, and he's going to make the [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=413.78000000000003s)]
*  decision. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=418.1s)]
*  He has changed his mind in the past, though. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=420.34000000000003s)]
*  Do you think that there is something, there is some line that happens? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=423.34000000000003s)]
*  What will you be watching for that might possibly say, OK, in spite of him saying that he supports [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=427.21999999999997s)]
*  and maybe not so much? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=433.09999999999997s)]
*  Well, I think if you start to see some break in the MAGA media about Hegseth, people saying, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=435.18s)]
*  Mr. President, he is undermining you, he's making you look bad, and that's what it comes [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=441.41999999999996s)]
*  down to, not whether or not he's putting the Pentagon in danger, but whether he is embarrassing [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=445.62s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=450.65999999999997s)]
*  When Donald Trump decides he's a liability and an embarrassment, he'll get rid of him, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=451.65999999999997s)]
*  because as we know with Donald Trump, loyalty only goes one way. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=456.38s)]
*  We're not there yet, but this really does go cut against one of the major thrusts of [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=460.65999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump, which is that I will make America respected and strong and secure. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=468.3s)]
*  And clearly, with Pete Hegseth running the Pentagon, we are less secure and we are less [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=472.86s)]
*  respected. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=479.94s)]
*  So I don't know what the trigger is going to be, but somebody is going to sit down with [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=480.94s)]
*  the president and say, Mr. President, this guy is hurting you. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=484.78s)]
*  And that's when he'll move. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=488.65999999999997s)]
*  Meantime, Sabrina, Senator Schiff sent a letter to the National Archives and Records Administration. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=491.5s)]
*  He's asking them to open an investigation into whether the Trump administration and [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=495.85999999999996s)]
*  its officials are following the laws that require government officials to preserve communications. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=500.14s)]
*  What are the rules around that? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=506.26s)]
*  Yeah, and it's pretty clear that they're not. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=507.97999999999996s)]
*  The rules are that the Presidential Records Act dictates that anything relating to government [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=510.94s)]
*  responses, correspondence, whether it be emails, text messages, have to be done on government [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=516.42s)]
*  systems, government phones. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=521.14s)]
*  And so the fact that Pete Hegseth was using his personal phone to transmit very sensitive, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=523.54s)]
*  classified information to coordinate with the national security apparatus, which you [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=530.5s)]
*  saw with that first thread that was started by Mike Walz, the national security adviser, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=535.02s)]
*  and then, of course, the second thread that Pete Hegseth started, not only coordinating [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=539.2s)]
*  with aides in his office, but for some reason, including his wife, his brother, and his personal [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=543.6s)]
*  attorney. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=548.9200000000001s)]
*  None of this complies with the Presidential Records Act, which is why it's good to see [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=549.9200000000001s)]
*  that Senator Schiff sent that letter, because it is important to preserve these records [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=554.6800000000001s)]
*  because this is our history. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=558.6800000000001s)]
*  And at some point in the future, someone will want to look back at this time and certainly [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=560.6s)]
*  take lessons from it. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtNIZly2jNw&t=564.12s)]
