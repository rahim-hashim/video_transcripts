Video Description: MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell details how House Republicans are hiding debate on a massive tax cut bill that Donald Trump is urging them to vote for “because they know what a betrayal it is to their own campaign promises … apparently not realizing that if Republicans do pass this bill, they will lose the House of Representatives in the next election.”

# Lawrence: Trump's budget bill has created a 'legislative suicide pact' for House Republicans
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y)
*  Well, at this hour, the Republicans and the House of Representatives are desperately trying [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=0.0s)]
*  to figure out how to pass a bill that Donald Trump urged them to vote for today, apparently [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=3.72s)]
*  not realizing that if Republicans do pass this bill, they will lose the House of Representatives [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=8.86s)]
*  in the next election. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  And that would once again expose Donald Trump to the possibility of being impeached by the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=17.92s)]
*  House of Representatives when it is controlled by the Democrats. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=26.74s)]
*  Donald Trump will have two years of impeachment exposure there with Hakeem Jeffries as the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=30.259999999999998s)]
*  possible next speaker of the House of Representatives. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=37.019999999999996s)]
*  If the Republicans managed to do what they're trying to do tonight, that will be partly [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=40.42s)]
*  the result. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=47.26s)]
*  Donald Trump plays politics the way he does everything else, immediate gratification, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=48.62s)]
*  no long-term planning. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=54.8s)]
*  That is apparently how Donald Trump ended up alone in a hotel room with porn star Stormy [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=56.6s)]
*  Daniels, which eventually led to him being convicted 34 felonies in the aftermath of [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=60.04s)]
*  that particular pursuit of instant gratification with no long-term planning. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=66.8s)]
*  Most presidents actually throughout our history have never made a trip up to Congress to try [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=73.7s)]
*  to push a bill in trouble over the legislative finish line. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=79.74000000000001s)]
*  Most presidents never did that in their entire presidency. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=83.36s)]
*  It is not a sign of strength that Donald Trump had to go to the House of Representatives today [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=86.86s)]
*  and beg them in person to pass a giant tax cut bill that is filled with all sorts of [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=92.82s)]
*  other things that Donald Trump doesn't understand that violate Trump campaign promises like [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=102.26s)]
*  cuts to Medicaid and ending a provision of the Affordable Care Act that will rip health [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=108.52s)]
*  care coverage away between the Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, a total of 13 million [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=113.24s)]
*  people according to the expert projections of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=118.02s)]
*  As of now, right now, Republicans do not have the votes to pass that bill in the House of [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=124.5s)]
*  Representatives, but Politico is reporting tonight. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=131.57999999999998s)]
*  Senator Johnson's leadership circle believes they can lean on the final holdouts until [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=134.9s)]
*  they break, possibly with help from Trump. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=140.38s)]
*  Well, that has worked almost every time for Donald Trump. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=144.4s)]
*  It didn't work in 2017 when Senator John McCain, who knew he was dying then, suffering [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=149.18s)]
*  from a fatal cancer, cast the decisive vote at 1.29 a.m. to defeat Donald Trump's final [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=154.76s)]
*  attempt to repeal Obamacare. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=164.2s)]
*  It's always in the middle of the night because the congressional leadership trying to pass [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=169.34s)]
*  a difficult bill by one vote is always trying to rush it because the longer you let members [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=174.06s)]
*  think about it, maybe sleep on it, a difficult vote, the less likely you are to get that [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=181.96s)]
*  difficult vote from those members. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=189.66s)]
*  And in the end, leadership uses the physical fatigue of the middle of the night session [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=191.42000000000002s)]
*  as another way of crushing the strength of the holdouts. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=197.22s)]
*  And so in the middle of the night tonight, the weak Republican speaker of the House will [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=200.56s)]
*  try to get a vote through the Rules Committee beginning at 1 a.m. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=207.14s)]
*  The Rules Committee is the last stop for any bill being voted on by the House of Representatives [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=214.0s)]
*  before it goes to the House floor. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=218.54s)]
*  If the bill makes it through the Rules Committee, it could still fail on the House floor. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=220.38s)]
*  But in the past, the right-wing Republican holdouts, who always claim they won't vote [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=226.39999999999998s)]
*  that wildly increase the national debt and they won't vote for a multi-trillion dollar [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=233.38s)]
*  increase in the debt ceiling, those guys, they always cave every time they cave. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=239.06s)]
*  They're really reliable. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=245.38s)]
*  They are never telling the truth when they say they won't vote for a Trump bill. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=247.24s)]
*  Chip Roy of Texas every time, every time does the same grandstand performances, holds out [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=252.14s)]
*  for a few days about how outrageous it is that we have not brought the budget deficit [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=258.04s)]
*  to zero and eliminated the national debt and how dare we raise the debt ceiling again. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=263.26000000000005s)]
*  Chip Roy has voted to increase the national debt by greater amounts than the national [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=268.12s)]
*  debt increased during the entire Senate career of Joe Biden. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=273.68s)]
*  That's how much Republicans, through massive tax cuts and overspending, especially overspending [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=278.38s)]
*  on defense, have increased the national debt. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=286.41999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump has, knowingly or unknowingly, it's always impossible to tell with him, agreed [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=290.46s)]
*  to violate his campaign pledge to not cut Medicaid. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=296.62s)]
*  In this massive budget bill, there are the biggest cuts to Medicaid in the history of [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=302.44s)]
*  the program, cuts that will throw 8 million people out of the Medicaid system and leave [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=307.34s)]
*  them without health insurance of any kind and no chance of getting it. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=313.84s)]
*  Donald Trump promised he would never do that. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=318.9s)]
*  Today, he told the gathered news media at the Capitol that the lie that he's not in [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=322.38s)]
*  favor of cutting Medicaid, he just wants to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicaid. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=329.47999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump was unable to identify a single item of waste or fraud or abuse in the Medicaid [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=337.82s)]
*  system and no reporter who asked him a question even tried to press him on that point of what [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=344.8s)]
*  waste, fraud, and abuse is because the Washington news media plays by completely different rules [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=350.82s)]
*  with Donald Trump. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=355.84s)]
*  The number one rule is, generally speaking, and this doesn't apply to every one of them, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=357.12s)]
*  but it overwhelmingly applies to the group. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=362.8s)]
*  The number one determining factor in the way they treat Donald Trump is overwhelming fear. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=365.0s)]
*  That is what allows Donald Trump to simply talk over the reporters without ever being [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=373.56s)]
*  interrupted by a reporter. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=377.66s)]
*  They never scream at Donald Trump the way they screamed at Joe Biden because, among [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=379.52s)]
*  other things, they are very much afraid of Donald Trump, just like Republican members [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=382.66s)]
*  of Congress. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=389.66s)]
*  So, the right wingers who claim to be the so-called budget hawks, the Republicans who [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=390.66s)]
*  claim that they care about the national debt more than anything else, those Republicans [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=395.92s)]
*  will, as they always have, go along with Donald Trump and be willing to vote another huge [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=401.20000000000005s)]
*  increase in the national debt. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=406.62s)]
*  And this time, the bill is going to pass or be defeated with the votes of New York Republicans [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=408.78000000000003s)]
*  and California Republicans in the House who will have to betray their constituents and [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=418.0s)]
*  the promises that they made to their constituents in their last congressional campaign in order [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=423.71999999999997s)]
*  to vote for this bill. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=429.03999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump is not the only Republican who is violating his campaign pledges by supporting [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=430.84s)]
*  this bill. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=435.84s)]
*  You will hear the word salt thrown around about this legislation. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=437.02s)]
*  It is one of those completely indefensible and unnecessary shorthands that the political [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=442.53999999999996s)]
*  community uses, in this case for, state and local taxes. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=449.18s)]
*  See? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=454.21999999999997s)]
*  That's how easy it is to say. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=455.21999999999997s)]
*  State and local taxes. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=456.5s)]
*  For the lifetimes of everyone listening to my voice now on television or serious radio, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=458.02s)]
*  state income taxes and property taxes have always been fully deductible on your federal [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=464.34s)]
*  income tax return. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=472.28s)]
*  And that's how some people are able to afford their homes. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=473.76s)]
*  Because they can deduct the property taxes on their homes from their tax returns, that's [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=477.08s)]
*  the key that enables them to afford their homes. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=481.84s)]
*  And it took Republicans in the Trump presidency and Donald Trump to decide to virtually eliminate [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=487.0s)]
*  that deductibility. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=493.28s)]
*  They limited that deductibility, which used to be unlimited. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=494.4s)]
*  They limited it at $10,000, which is less than the property tax bill of many middle-class [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=498.24s)]
*  taxpayers on Long Island and in California and in Pennsylvania. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=508.7s)]
*  And in typical Trumpian fashion, having inflicted this pain on those taxpayers, which dramatically [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=513.1800000000001s)]
*  increased the tax burden on those taxpayers, the overall tax burden. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=521.62s)]
*  In Donald Trump's campaign for the presidency last year, he said he was going to eliminate [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=526.86s)]
*  the tax pain that he inflicted on them. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=531.6s)]
*  Donald Trump's tax cut during his first presidency was the first tax cut in history that actually [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=534.48s)]
*  raised taxes on some taxpayers. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=540.5s)]
*  And it did it by eliminating the deductibility of state and local taxes on a federal tax [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=543.04s)]
*  return. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=548.42s)]
*  Many, many, many people around the country saw their overall tax burden increase, their [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=549.6s)]
*  whole tax burden increased significantly after Donald Trump's so-called tax cut, which was [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=555.28s)]
*  not a tax cut for them. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=561.54s)]
*  It was a tax increase. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=564.24s)]
*  And it wasn't a tax cut for people around the country who ended up paying more in taxes [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=566.52s)]
*  because of the elimination of the deductibility of state and local taxes. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=572.76s)]
*  And so when Donald Trump was campaigning last year, he knew this was a problem. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=577.4s)]
*  And so he promised those taxpayers whose taxes he had raised that he would fix it. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=581.06s)]
*  The guy who caused the problem came to the voters of Long Island and said to them and [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=587.6199999999999s)]
*  elsewhere in the country, Pennsylvania, said to those voters, in effect, vote for me and [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=592.0999999999999s)]
*  I'll fix the problem that I caused you. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=596.52s)]
*  He forgot to mention at the time that he caused the problem. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=599.0799999999999s)]
*  Here he is on Long Island last September making that promise. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=601.8199999999999s)]
*  I will cut taxes for families, small businesses and workers, including restoring the salt [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=606.8s)]
*  deduction, saving thousands of dollars for residents of New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=612.8s)]
*  and other high cost states. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=619.8s)]
*  That audience knew what salt meant. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=623.52s)]
*  Did you hear that cheer go up? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=625.3199999999999s)]
*  That audience on Long Island knew exactly what he was talking about when he said the [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=627.3199999999999s)]
*  salt deduction because their tax burden went up because Donald Trump made state and local [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=632.32s)]
*  taxes no longer fully deductible. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=639.8000000000001s)]
*  To say that he was going to restore the salt deduction, meaning the salt deduction was [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=642.5600000000001s)]
*  going to be what it was before Donald Trump, and that means unlimited, just like the charitable [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=648.3000000000001s)]
*  deduction, almost every other deduction in the tax code. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=654.4000000000001s)]
*  Now Donald Trump is supporting a bill that will not restore the deductibility of all [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=657.24s)]
*  state and local taxes. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=663.04s)]
*  The bill will move the cap on that deduction from $10,000 to $40,000 as of this hour tonight. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=664.32s)]
*  That is not what Republican members of the House of Representatives from New York promised [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=673.4s)]
*  their constituents. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=677.48s)]
*  They promised to get them back to the good old times in taxation under President Obama [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=678.44s)]
*  when they could fully deduct their state and local taxes. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=686.8000000000001s)]
*  The senior senator from New York alerted New York voters today about what Donald Trump [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=690.96s)]
*  and New York Republican members of the House of Representatives are doing to them once [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=696.3800000000001s)]
*  again. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=701.86s)]
*  When Trump came to Long Island and talked a big game about restoring salt relief, I [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=704.8800000000001s)]
*  called it a farce. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=709.0400000000001s)]
*  It was actually a lie. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=711.12s)]
*  And today he has proved himself a liar and has seemingly played New York Republicans [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=713.6s)]
*  for fools. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=719.08s)]
*  And now the New York Republicans like Mike Waller and Elise Stefanik have their choice [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=721.22s)]
*  tonight at this very hour. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=726.0s)]
*  Vote like fools and lose their re-elections to the House of Representatives next year, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=729.8000000000001s)]
*  or defy Donald Trump. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=735.4s)]
*  If the bill passes, it will be reported as a Trump win. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=739.4s)]
*  If the bill passes, those House Republicans in New York, in Pennsylvania, in California [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=744.12s)]
*  will go from currently being the most vulnerable Republicans in next year's election campaign [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=753.84s)]
*  to Republicans who do not stand a chance in next year's congressional campaign. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=760.9599999999999s)]
*  And so in the politics of governing, the news media constantly makes the mistake of [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=766.36s)]
*  declaring a winner in the first inning of a nine-inning game. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=773.5600000000001s)]
*  If the Republicans pass this bill in the House of Representatives, they will lose those seats [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=778.88s)]
*  in New York. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=785.96s)]
*  They will lose the House of Representatives. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=786.96s)]
*  And if they don't pass this bill, then the Republican House of Representatives, because [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=790.4s)]
*  the Republican House of Chaos, and they will also lose the election for the House of Representatives [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=795.32s)]
*  next year after two years of being the Republican House of Chaos. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=801.82s)]
*  And so no matter what the outcome, the House Republicans, with Donald Trump's complete [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=807.88s)]
*  lack of comprehension, have constructed for themselves a legislative suicide pact that [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=813.64s)]
*  only the most incompetent haters of government could construct and only the kinds of politicians [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=821.64s)]
*  who absolutely don't mean anything they say could construct and vote for. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=827.64s)]
*  Chip Roy and the so-called hardcore budget hawks have never met what they say and they've [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=835.64s)]
*  proved that over and over again. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=842.16s)]
*  They have always voted when their votes were needed to increase the national debt. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=844.16s)]
*  And now, in Long Island and in Pennsylvania and in California, Republicans are going to [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=850.16s)]
*  find out if their House members lied to them about their tax burden. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=855.7199999999999s)]
*  It is not a sign of strength that the final key legislative committee process to move [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=863.88s)]
*  this bill is scheduled to occur at 1 a.m. in the middle of the night. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=869.48s)]
*  They don't want you to know. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=877.4s)]
*  They don't want you to watch. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=879.96s)]
*  They do not want you to know what they are doing. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=881.52s)]
*  They do not want their constituents to know. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=884.16s)]
*  They don't want their constituents to see what they are doing because they know what [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=886.6800000000001s)]
*  a betrayal it is to their own campaign promises, including Donald Trump's campaign promises. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=893.08s)]
*  The Democratic leader of the House of King Jeffries, who, with this bill, is now well [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=898.8000000000001s)]
*  on his way to being the next Speaker of the House after the next Congressional election, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=905.5200000000001s)]
*  said tonight, it is deeply troubling that you would attempt to jam this legislation [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=909.72s)]
*  down the throats of the American people. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=914.8800000000001s)]
*  What else are you hiding? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBfKckP1H0Y&t=918.12s)]
