# ‘No one is humiliating Donald Trump except for Donald Trump’: Nicolle on Wall Street mocking Trump
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8)
*  Before the break, we were talking about the downside of worrying about what it might do [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=0.0s)]
*  to Trump's ego to know that there is something called a taco trade. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  Trump always chickens out. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=11.0s)]
*  It is the story of his entire political rise. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=12.48s)]
*  I think that the risk that we were talking about before the break, which is, is there [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=16.6s)]
*  a danger in trying to goad or intentionally or unintentionally goading Trump, that's a [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=20.2s)]
*  real risk. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=25.64s)]
*  And we know that because of his political career. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=26.64s)]
*  So in 2011, Barack Obama gives this brilliant roast of Donald Trump at the White House [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=28.8s)]
*  Correspondents' Dinner after Trump had been going after him with the birther movement [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=33.36s)]
*  and so forth. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=37.2s)]
*  And Barack Obama, in his cool way, just eviscerates him. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=38.2s)]
*  And you see Donald Trump in the moment boiling over. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=41.88s)]
*  And the reporting on it is that that was a really pivotal moment that galvanized him [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=45.34s)]
*  then to run for president. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=49.08s)]
*  So he detests, he does detest being mocked, though he certainly likes mocking other people. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=50.28s)]
*  So that risk is real. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=55.84s)]
*  I think the fact that we are even having this conversation points to the bizarro world that [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=57.199999999999996s)]
*  we're in, in Trump 2 and in Trump 1, but particularly in Trump 2, where we're thinking about, you [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=61.64s)]
*  know, what if we make fun of Trump and then he'll respond in this way and the chaos that [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=68.75999999999999s)]
*  will be unleashed could be really damaging for America standing in the world and the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=72.44s)]
*  American economy. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=77.56s)]
*  You know, the fact that we are having that conversation points to this weird environment [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=78.56s)]
*  in which, you know, some people seem to be treating Trump like a senile uncle who needs [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=82.04s)]
*  to be appeased. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=87.08000000000001s)]
*  And it's under, you know, in the media, that's certainly not our job. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=89.16000000000001s)]
*  Our job is to tell the truth as we see it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=92.9s)]
*  You see in Congress and the people around Trump, people continuing to try to placate [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=95.80000000000001s)]
*  him, trying to play to his worst instincts, to all of his instincts in a way that's counterproductive, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=101.80000000000001s)]
*  I think. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=106.60000000000001s)]
*  The question is when they will grow a spine in Congress, when some people might stand [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=107.88000000000001s)]
*  up to him, what would be the set of events that would trigger Congress behaving like [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=113.4s)]
*  grownups and not trying to just pledge fealty to this president? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  Charlie, do you, on your bingo card, even play that game anymore? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=122.76s)]
*  I mean, is there a point where they respond to their constituents instead of Donald Trump's [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=128.8s)]
*  whims? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=133.28s)]
*  On the foreseeable future, because, I mean, you and I have been talking about this for [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=136.2s)]
*  ten years right now. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=139.88s)]
*  How many times have they had opportunities to do that? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=141.2s)]
*  The political costs are simply too high for them. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=144.48s)]
*  And frankly, look, waiting around for Republicans to show any sort of independence, I think, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=147.2s)]
*  is a fool's errand. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=153.2s)]
*  Now, on the edges, you know, perhaps they will push back, you know, here or there. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=154.2s)]
*  But the whole issue of tariffs has been so illustrative because it will have such a tremendous [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=159.07999999999998s)]
*  impact on the economy, on their own constituents. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=165.04000000000002s)]
*  They have the inherent power to block the tariffs. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  They are the Article One body in the Constitution. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=172.56s)]
*  And yet they have surrendered. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=176.04000000000002s)]
*  They have ceased functioning as a legislative body in many respects. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=177.52s)]
*  But you know, going back to your question about the dangers of humiliating Donald Trump, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=182.12s)]
*  you know how I feel about this. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=186.12s)]
*  I mean, I wish we could humiliate him on a daily basis. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=187.12s)]
*  I wish we could mock him. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  But Charlotte's absolutely right. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=191.52s)]
*  This is the bizarre world that we're living in, where everybody is walking around on eggshells, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=193.34s)]
*  you know, afraid to anger, or the senile uncle who has incredibly thin skin. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=198.66s)]
*  And the thing about Donald Trump is he is, of course, a complete narcissist, but he is [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=203.78s)]
*  he has a very, very thin skin. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=209.02s)]
*  And he is he's dangerous because he has the power and he has no restraint. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=210.86s)]
*  And I think that's just something that kind of the reality that we have to deal with. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=217.3s)]
*  There are some people who say that, you know, that that's a council of defeatism, that, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=221.29999999999998s)]
*  you know, resistance is futile, that we can't do anything about it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=225.45999999999998s)]
*  But it is the reality that we're living in right now. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=228.94s)]
*  And I think that to the extent that we can point out the absurdity of Donald Trump, the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=232.42s)]
*  fact that we can in fact show that the emperor does have no clothes. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=237.94s)]
*  And by the way, there's always a value to pointing out that the emperor is in fact buck [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=241.74s)]
*  naked when it is Donald Trump. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=246.74s)]
*  I think we ought to take that risk. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=249.46s)]
*  Well, Robert, I guess I would push back a little bit on the premise that anyone humiliated [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=251.74s)]
*  Donald Trump other than Donald Trump. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=257.66s)]
*  I mean, I mean, the truth of the number of times that he blinked is a data point that [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=260.02s)]
*  exists in public. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=266.26s)]
*  We know no investigative journalists dug up the number of times Trump balked because of [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=267.58s)]
*  the poor reception to his tariffs. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=272.7s)]
*  And they were announced. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=275.02s)]
*  They were paused. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=277.06s)]
*  They were raised. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=278.18s)]
*  They were dropped. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=279.06s)]
*  They were put back in. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=280.02s)]
*  They were pulled off. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=281.1s)]
*  A hundred deals in a hundred days. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=282.06s)]
*  There were none. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=283.62s)]
*  Now there's a framework for one with the UK and the beginning of talks in Switzerland with [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=284.38s)]
*  China. No framework, no deal. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=288.82s)]
*  So that's and I am no economist, but I could read a newspaper. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=290.82s)]
*  So no one's humiliating Donald Trump except Donald Trump. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=294.94s)]
*  Look, the reason the taco trade joke, which is kind of a dumb joke, stuck is because it [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=299.02s)]
*  has this huge element of truth in it. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=305.34000000000003s)]
*  And yes, a lot of times in the last 12 or 18 hours since that conversation in the White [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=308.1s)]
*  House, people either written me or mentioned me on social media saying this guy's dumb joke [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=313.5s)]
*  is going to cause a recession. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=319.14s)]
*  And I don't like that at all. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=320.94s)]
*  I meant to make a joke, not cause a recession. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=322.9s)]
*  But there is a serious question here about as Charlotte and Charlie have have just argued [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=325.94s)]
*  so well, there's a serious question about a world in which you're not allowed to make [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=332.34000000000003s)]
*  fun of the president. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=338.54s)]
*  He's the president. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=340.82s)]
*  I am an inky fingered hack making a dumb joke. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=342.26s)]
*  I'm the one who's supposed to behave carefully around the president of the United States. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=347.02000000000004s)]
*  How did we get here? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=352.18s)]
*  I mean, this situation, bizarre doesn't even begin to cover it as far as I'm concerned. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=353.98s)]
*  Well, Robert, I would argue if we enter into a recession, it will have nothing to do with [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=359.06s)]
*  you. It will be Donald Trump's policies that tip us toward a recession. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=363.7s)]
*  And if you look at how, you know, I mean, look, the study of body of fiction around [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=367.82s)]
*  dysfunctional families, it's the same story all the time. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=373.82s)]
*  An otherwise normal body bends and collapses around the mentally ill or addicted or most [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=377.1s)]
*  sick member of the family. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=382.94s)]
*  A country is the same. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=384.62s)]
*  So we had the Republican Party collapse onto itself around the dysfunctional leader. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=386.02000000000004s)]
*  And then you had all of the, you know, sort of partisan actors collapse. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=391.14000000000004s)]
*  And now you're saying Trump collapsed the economy around his dysfunction. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=396.26s)]
*  You know, it's not all together, unlike the inner circle of Biden collapsing around him. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=401.22s)]
*  He was frail. He was really unqualified to be president. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=408.74s)]
*  They knew it and they collapsed around him. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=412.5s)]
*  And that was no good. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=414.53999999999996s)]
*  And similarly, treating the current president with kid gloves by his advisors or by the [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=416.09999999999997s)]
*  press or by anybody else is a bad idea. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=422.21999999999997s)]
*  It was a bad idea with a Democrat. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=425.62s)]
*  It's a bad idea with a Republican. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=427.26s)]
*  We shouldn't do it. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtP7p0ZVk8&t=428.9s)]
