# ‘Classic example’ of admin ‘weaponizing government’: Ex-lawmaker reacts to Rep. McIver’s charges
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY)
*  I want to bring in NBC's Ken Delaney and following this from Washington Julie [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=0.0s)]
*  Serkin is on Capitol Hill. Former Maryland Democratic Congresswoman Donna [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=4.32s)]
*  Edwards is an MSNBC political analyst and MSNBC legal correspondent Lisa Rubin is [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=8.32s)]
*  here with me in studio. Julie the president weighed in on this just a [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=13.6s)]
*  short time ago he said MacGyver was out of control. Tell us more about what she's [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=17.76s)]
*  saying and what we're hearing from other members of her party. Well thanks to that [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=22.68s)]
*  great video from our own Brennan Leach who questioned Rep MacGyver when these [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=26.56s)]
*  charges of course came out the first opportunity to do so this morning. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=31.18s)]
*  Interestingly the Congresswoman from New Jersey the Democrats said she first [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=34.68s)]
*  heard of the charges found out about them when she saw them posted online. She [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=38.28s)]
*  didn't get a heads up she didn't get other notification according to her [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=43.2s)]
*  comments. This is a precarious moment though for Democrats who do not control [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=46.64s)]
*  any part of the government meaning all they can really do is pursue oversight [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=50.56s)]
*  of these matters. They can also I guess try to impeach the president again but we [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=55.24s)]
*  saw what leadership did when it came to a member offering that last week but [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=59.92s)]
*  they keep on hammering this point of due process. We saw that time and time and [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=64.28s)]
*  again when it came to the immigrants who were deported one of them of course to [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=68.36s)]
*  El Salvador them standing up in that way not for illegal immigration but for due [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  process and of course MacGyver here repeating that as it concerns her [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=77.48s)]
*  situation here take a listen to what Hakeem Jeffries the Democratic leader in [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=81.32s)]
*  the House had to say last week before these charges officially came out watch. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=85.47999999999999s)]
*  What happens if they were to go and arrest these members or if they would [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=90.55999999999999s)]
*  try to sanction them during the House of Representatives? They'll find out. What would you do though? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=94.88s)]
*  I mean of course I mean doesn't that broach a... They'll find out. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=98.52s)]
*  Doesn't that go across... That's a red line. What's the what's the red line though? I mean I know we have the speech... [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=102.52s)]
*  It's a red line. It's very clear. Democrats standing behind MacGyver the other Democrats in [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=106.76s)]
*  New Jersey who of course attended that protest at the ICE facility they talked [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=113.44s)]
*  about this I'm told in a closed-door meeting this morning with all Democrats [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=117.84s)]
*  and Democratic leadership so far though keeping their cards very close to their [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=121.68s)]
*  vests is what they plan to do next and that red line that Hakeem Jeffries [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=125.56s)]
*  describes. So Ken can you explain these charges put them into some context they [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=128.76s)]
*  involve among other things this story does the mayor of Newark so tell us what [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=133.8s)]
*  exactly was going on there? Yeah well first of all this is not typical to [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=140.72s)]
*  charge a member of Congress and neither is the way the Justice Department rolled [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=144.84s)]
*  it out. Chris announcing it before releasing the charging documents. Take a [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=147.76000000000002s)]
*  listen to our colleagues more from our colleagues hallway interview with [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=151.64000000000001s)]
*  the congressman this morning. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=154.12s)]
*  Were you made aware of these charges before it was put on Twitter? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=157.60000000000002s)]
*  That's how you found out? Correct. And do you receive any charging documents or anything like that? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=161.92s)]
*  As of this morning my attorneys have the charging documents. And is your plan to turn yourself in or do they have to come to do? What is the process? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=168.92s)]
*  That's the end of my question guys. Thank you. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=179.92s)]
*  So the criminal complaint against representative MacGyver finally was [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=181.92s)]
*  released today and it says she slammed her forearm into the body of a homeland [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=186.24s)]
*  security agent as she was trying to prevent the arrest of the Newark mayor. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=190.6s)]
*  The complaint says she yelled surround the mayor and it includes several photos [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=193.6s)]
*  of what looks like her forearm contacting agents back. We also saw that [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=197.79999999999998s)]
*  in the video. It says the photos illustrate her attempts to quote forcibly [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  assault, resist, oppose, impede and intimidate the officer as he tried to [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=205.24s)]
*  carry out his duties. Now this charge against her is a misdemeanor charge of [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=210.12s)]
*  simple assault that carries a penalty of up to one year in jail or a fine. US [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=213.72s)]
*  attorney Alina Habba suggested that she tried to resolve this case without [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=218.8s)]
*  charges. She said she gave the representative every opportunity to come [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=222.36s)]
*  to a resolution but she has unfortunately declined. MacGyver says she [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=226.32000000000002s)]
*  did nothing wrong and is accusing federal agents of escalating the [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=230.68s)]
*  situation by arresting the mayor of Newark without cause. Her lawyer said in [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=233.44s)]
*  the statement that quote ICE agents chose to escalate what should have been a [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=237.64000000000001s)]
*  peaceful situation into chaos and that this prosecution is an attempt to shift [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=241.08s)]
*  the blame for ICE's behavior to Congresswoman MacGyver. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=245.4s)]
*  Chris. Thank you so much for that. So Lisa, ICE itself, I should say back in [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=249.12s)]
*  February they released a notification. It says that when it comes to members of [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=253.36s)]
*  Congress quote ICE will comply with the law and accommodate members seeking to [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=257.48s)]
*  visit or tour an ICE detention facility for the purpose of conducting oversight. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=262.12s)]
*  And in fact the congressman says after this couple they were indeed allowed to [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=267.24s)]
*  go in there. So what do you see and how do you see this case unfolding? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=271.2s)]
*  Well first of all I want to go back to something that Ken said because if you [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=275.28000000000003s)]
*  read the criminal complaint really closely the statute at issue here can [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=278.16s)]
*  be used to charge either a misdemeanor or a felony. What converts it into a [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=282.28000000000003s)]
*  felony is where you have a physical assault or physical contact and indeed [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=286.64s)]
*  Congresswoman MacGyver has been charged with two felonies here in both cases of [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=292.28000000000003s)]
*  the alleged forcible assault. She is said to have had physical contact first [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=297.52s)]
*  with an agent from Homeland Security Investigations, secondarily with an ICE [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=303.32s)]
*  deportation officer. But Chris going back to the entitlement of members of [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=307.8s)]
*  Congress to conduct oversight. In one way that's not an issue here right? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=312.84s)]
*  Because what she's being charged with is an assault having to do with her [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=317.2s)]
*  efforts to preclude the officers from arresting Newark Mayor Roz Baraka. On [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=321.68s)]
*  the other hand it would have never gotten and to that point if there were [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=326.64s)]
*  not hours worth of efforts by Congresswoman MacGyver and her two [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=332.16s)]
*  congressional colleagues to get the tour to which they were entitled. They say [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=336.4s)]
*  that they spent hours inside the facility outside the facility being [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=341.12s)]
*  shuttled around being delayed by the folks inside when all they were trying [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=345.16s)]
*  to do is exercise the right to oversight which ICE itself as you just said has [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=349.8s)]
*  publicly acknowledged and indeed if they considered her a threat to public [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=355.04s)]
*  safety why then did they give her that tour in the aftermath of the scrum that [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=359.24s)]
*  is at the heart of these charges? So Congresswoman what kind of stress test [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=365.36s)]
*  does this place on? I guess separation of powers when you have the Trump [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=370.2s)]
*  administration charging a sitting member of Congress in a situation like this. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=373.36s)]
*  Well I mean for all the talk that the President Trump and the Trump [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=378.96s)]
*  administration have made about weaponizing the government this is a [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=383.0s)]
*  classic example of the administration the executive branch weaponizing [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=386.76000000000005s)]
*  government against members of Congress who were exercising their [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=392.64000000000004s)]
*  responsibilities as members of Congress. I mean the first wrong here happened [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=397.12s)]
*  when they were denied the opportunity at first to go in and do their [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=402.24s)]
*  congressional duty and so I just I think that it's not really clear frankly [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=407.76000000000005s)]
*  from the video there was a lot of pushing and shoving going on and it's [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=412.64000000000004s)]
*  not really clear that the Congresswoman frankly wasn't pushed into into these [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=416.44s)]
*  into these officers and so I don't think that the the video itself is evidence [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=422.12s)]
*  of any criminal action or intent but more than that politically for members [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=427.44s)]
*  of Congress that whether they're showing up at the border at a government [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=434.32s)]
*  facility they should not be kept from doing their jobs for acting there in [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=438.48s)]
*  their responsibility and I think it's going to be really important for both [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=444.08000000000004s)]
*  Democrats in the Congress and also for the Congresswoman to exercise her right [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=447.8s)]
*  to defend herself against these charges. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=452.16s)]
*  It's likely won't be the last time Democrats want to get a look at a [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=456.24s)]
*  detention facility like this. I mean the administration has made it very clear [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=459.84000000000003s)]
*  they want to continue to have deportations. Is there something Democrats [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=465.36s)]
*  should be doing differently moving forward. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=470.56s)]
*  Yeah well look I think that what Democrats have to do is really even what [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=474.04s)]
*  their Republican Republican colleagues I mean there were times under the the [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=479.88s)]
*  Biden administration where Republicans wanted to visit the border they were not [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=485.08000000000004s)]
*  impeded in doing that they wanted to visit detention facilities they were not [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=489.8s)]
*  impeded in exercising that responsibility and so you know Democrats [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=494.44s)]
*  really have to stand up for the you know for the Article 1 branch for the [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=500.44s)]
*  legislative branch and its ability to exercise oversight but without the you [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=505.96s)]
*  know cooperation of the majority defending the right of the of the [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=511.96s)]
*  legislature it's hard to say what it is that the Trump administration could or [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=519.12s)]
*  could not get away with and this we see I think a great overall effort by the [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=525.08s)]
*  overreach and overstep on the part of the administration. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=530.16s)]
*  And there's a bigger picture here too Lisa as well the Washington report of [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=534.4s)]
*  the last week that the DOJ wants to make it so prosecutors around the country [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=537.4s)]
*  don't have to check with them before charging lawmakers with crimes. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=541.88s)]
*  What could that mean. Well you know Chris I asked this question of the Department [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=545.5600000000001s)]
*  of Justice last night because I was curious to know whether they followed [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=549.28s)]
*  their own existing policy in charging Congresswoman MacGyver. Current policy [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IG0ax1LGjY&t=553.08s)]
