# ‘We’re going to continue to win’: Inside Democratic AGs’ fight against Donald Trump’s agenda
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc)
*  With the Republican controlled Congress giving President Donald Trump pretty much free reign to enact any policies he desires [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=0.0s)]
*  It has been left to the states in the courts to provide the necessary [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=6.96s)]
*  Checks and balances to the man who is grasping for more power more more power since Trump's inauguration [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=10.28s)]
*  Democratic attorneys general have filed 30 lawsuits combined against the administration [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  Focus on far-reaching issues including immigration and due process [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=22.36s)]
*  Tariffs federal worker layoffs and the dismantling of federal agencies and in many cases [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=25.96s)]
*  They're winning just on Thursday a federal judge ordered the reinstatement of the National Service Program [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=31.64s)]
*  AmeriCorps and its grants across 24 Democratic led states after Doge and the administration tried to dismantle it [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=38.24s)]
*  Joining us now three [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  Democratic attorneys general that were part of that lawsuit [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=48.96s)]
*  Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser and [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=52.24s)]
*  Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raul. Thank you all very much for coming to the weekend [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=57.56s)]
*  So some Democratic attorneys general have described entering the next phase of their legal battles against the Trump administration [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  Attorney General, I'll start with you. Do you agree that you've entered a new phase and if so [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=72.76s)]
*  What makes this phase different? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=78.52000000000001s)]
*  Well, I don't know. I mean, I think it's a continuous [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=82.0s)]
*  Experience for us because each and every day and quite frankly each and every portion of a day brings a new challenge to us [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=85.47999999999999s)]
*  certainly we we entered different phases of [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=93.8s)]
*  different litigation that we're engaged in where we start often with temporary restraining orders and [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=98.16s)]
*  then preliminary injunctions and sometimes there [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=105.67999999999999s)]
*  There are appeals on certain portions of our claims to [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=109.72s)]
*  courts of review [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=116.36s)]
*  and so [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=118.36s)]
*  Depending on which matter you're talking about. We're in a different phase, but right with each and every day. There's a new action [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=120.44s)]
*  AG Jennings, you know one of the things that we continue to see with this administration is emergency appeals on [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=126.96s)]
*  Friday Trump asked the Supreme Court to let him basically gut the Education Department [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=133.56s)]
*  In an emergency appeal it's happened over and over and over again [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=139.0s)]
*  Right that they kind of want to get thrown on this shadow docket [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=142.92s)]
*  And I'm curious what you think of that as a strategy [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=146.23999999999998s)]
*  It seems like at least contagi brown-jacks and the Supreme Court justice is getting a little exhausted by all of these emergencies [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=148.89999999999998s)]
*  that's exactly right good morning and [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=155.64s)]
*  Trump has had to appeal to the United States Supreme Court [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=159.12s)]
*  quite often because [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=163.67999999999998s)]
*  we're beating him and [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=165.92s)]
*  the courts below and [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=168.28s)]
*  right now this [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=170.04s)]
*  Democratic State Attorneys General are the strongest [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=172.35999999999999s)]
*  bulwark that [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=175.64s)]
*  This country has against Donald Trump's cruel and arbitrary [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=177.23999999999998s)]
*  decisions and [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=181.67999999999998s)]
*  So using the shadow docket isn't the right way to go [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=183.2s)]
*  Shadow means that it's not transparent and what I believe is that we're gonna prevail [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=187.76s)]
*  Whatever court we are in because we have the law and the United States Constitution on our side [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=194.92s)]
*  We're gonna continue to fight and we are going to continue to win [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=201.44s)]
*  and general wiser [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=206.35999999999999s)]
*  The Supreme Court did something that I find extremely troubling and that is they have allowed [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=208.56s)]
*  Doge to access [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=214.95999999999998s)]
*  Social security data that is the most personal and private of private informations of [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=217.44s)]
*  American people how concerned should we be that now people? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=224.32s)]
*  Who were brought in by someone who was not elected and not Senate confirmed? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=228.72s)]
*  Will now have these folks will now have access to our information [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=234.39999999999998s)]
*  I'm concerned about that and we brought our own case involves other private information [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=239.32s)]
*  Your tax returns your bank accounts all this held at the Department of Treasury and what we highlighted in that case [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=244.79999999999998s)]
*  And we want in that case like the others we're talking about is that people who are unsupervised? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=251.48s)]
*  People who are not trained people who didn't follow protocols had access to information that could end up on the dark web and other places [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=257.52s)]
*  There are protocols in government to protect people and to protect our information [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=265.59999999999997s)]
*  For good reasons the Supreme Court making this decision as AG Jennings said in a hasty way on the so-called [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=271.0s)]
*  Shadow docket it's not the right way for them to decide important issues [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=279.40000000000003s)]
*  There's too much room for error it should take its time as Justice Jackson said it should be careful and deliberate [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=283.92s)]
*  This administration is being reckless. They're acting hastily and the way Doge has gone about their work is very concerning [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=290.84000000000003s)]
*  That's why we brought this case against the Department Treasury [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=298.52000000000004s)]
*  That's why we won this other case is not one that we were involved with [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=300.8s)]
*  But it obviously concerns us and we're gonna keep protecting the American people [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=304.6s)]
*  Hey to your our well, you know, what as you said, what do you think is kind of the [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=308.96000000000004s)]
*  Most dangerous actions that the administration has done that have gone to court [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=315.12s)]
*  I know, you know for you guys is all probably the rule of law [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=319.24s)]
*  But that would do the side for a bit. So that's a huge one [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=322.84000000000003s)]
*  Are the things that have gone to court that you've seen workers wait to the courts was most concerning to you [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=325.44s)]
*  Well, first of all, you know, I think generally across the board. There's not a single action that we have filed [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=330.12s)]
*  Because we have a policy difference with the administration [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=337.96s)]
*  We do have that policy difference [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=341.84s)]
*  But we found each and every case because the Constitution has been thrown out the window [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=343.47999999999996s)]
*  The the laws enacted by Congress have been thrown out the window [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=348.03999999999996s)]
*  We filed these lawsuits because they've been pursued illegally and Donald Trump said [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=352.03999999999996s)]
*  Maybe a month or so ago when asked whether he has the obligation of following the Constitution. He says I don't know [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=357.24s)]
*  I'm not a lawyer. We cannot stand aside [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=363.36s)]
*  As attorneys general or as a public at large [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=366.59999999999997s)]
*  When we have a president of the United States who took an oath to uphold the Constitution [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=370.35999999999996s)]
*  Who's saying that he doesn't know whether he has to follow the Constitution? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=375.44s)]
*  certainly for me as a cancer survivor the NIH grants and NSF grants that allow a research institutions to [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=379.91999999999996s)]
*  research cures for cancer and other disease is a personal one to me birthright [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=388.76s)]
*  Citizenship is a personal one to me because I am a birthright citizen, but across the board. It's it's a methodology [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=394.36s)]
*  I'm a G Jennings [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=402.8s)]
*  Of all there's so many things you guys are fine. All of you are firing on all cylinders [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=405.12s)]
*  To push back against this administration [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=411.24s)]
*  Are there things coming down the road that you have your eye on that? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=413.96000000000004s)]
*  We we aren't paying attention to just yet [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=418.48s)]
*  Well, we're paying attention to everything he does and [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=421.4s)]
*  When he breaks the law and we have the legal to tools in our toolbox, which we tend to have pretty strongly [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=424.56s)]
*  We're going to fight him. He seems to be very focused right now on [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=432.15999999999997s)]
*  immigration and requiring [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=437.76s)]
*  people like [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=440.88s)]
*  Friends of mine who fight domestic violence to sign [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=443.68s)]
*  Certifications to get violence against women funds [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=447.59999999999997s)]
*  That require these organizations to agree that they are not going to do anything illegal in the immigration front [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=451.76s)]
*  They're not going to practice diversity. They are not going to do xyz [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=459.44s)]
*  And it just makes no sense to me. These are grants that historically been handed out to [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=467.2s)]
*  Victims of domestic violence. They've been a bulwark for our state and states across the country [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=473.2s)]
*  Fighting against domestic violence and now they're being asked to [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=481.12s)]
*  Certify to things that have nothing to do with their organization's mission. That's cruel. That's unnecessary [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=486.08s)]
*  And it's hurting victims directly [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=494.08s)]
*  That's cruel that's unnecessary and it's hurting victims directly [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=496.71999999999997s)]
*  Ady wiser one of the things that we know about this administration is they're not scared to go after their political opponents and the the retaliation [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=502.0s)]
*  Personally on folks who they see as their enemies comes almost every single day. Are you worried about political retaliation personally? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=511.12s)]
*  Well president trump's attacked me personally on true social [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=521.6s)]
*  And I have had death threats against me [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=524.9599999999999s)]
*  I'm putting myself out there to run for governor of my state to stay in elected public service because i'm not afraid [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=528.4s)]
*  And I believe that this republic is a republic where everybody has the rights [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=534.64s)]
*  Accorded under the constitution the 14th amendment says all persons have due process of law [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=541.42s)]
*  My family came here after surviving the holocaust [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=547.52s)]
*  My mom was actually born in a concentration camp and was liberated by the u.s army [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=550.72s)]
*  And so like my fellow ags protecting the constitution is personal to me [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=555.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm not afraid of standing up for what I believe in. I recognize that we're living in a very dark time and a time when [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=560.4s)]
*  People who are elected officials even judges are being targeted but we're fighting for something we believe in and we have work to do [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=568.3199999999999s)]
*  We have our own obligations the constitution it's worth mentioning and aj roel said this [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=575.12s)]
*  The president said he doesn't know if he's to follow the constitution and that's clear [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=580.08s)]
*  He doesn't know because the first day in office he tried to override the 14th amendment's protection of birthright citizenship [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=583.9200000000001s)]
*  And when that case went to the supreme court people weren't even defending the merits of what he did [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=589.84s)]
*  The question that was really on the table is whether or not everyone or every state has to bring their own case [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=594.48s)]
*  Or can you get a universal injunction to protect the constitution when the constitution's on the line? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=599.76s)]
*  I'll fight for it and i'm not going to be afraid [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=604.08s)]
*  Attorney's general kathy jennings [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=607.12s)]
*  Phil wiser and kwame raul. Thank you so much for the treat to have all three of you on to get today [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=609.36s)]
*  We'll have to do it again sometime [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcclsAAt7Uc&t=613.92s)]
