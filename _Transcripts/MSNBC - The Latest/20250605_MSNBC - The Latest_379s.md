# Russia 'giving the finger to the entire world': Zelenskyy slams Putin for delaying negotiations
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI)
*  Welcome back. A stark new warning from Russia's Vladimir Putin issued via President Trump in a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=0.0s)]
*  social media post. President Trump says he spoke with Putin for more than an hour yesterday [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=5.44s)]
*  and that Putin vowed strong retaliation for the stunning Ukrainian drone assault across multiple [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  locations deep inside Russia this week. New footage released by the Ukrainian security service [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=17.04s)]
*  shows more of that attack that devastated some aircraft of Russia's bomber fleet, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=23.36s)]
*  a surprise assault a whole year and a half in the making. Let's go to NBC's chief international [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=27.52s)]
*  correspondent, Keir Simmons, for the very latest. Keir, where does Putin's retaliation threats [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=32.56s)]
*  leave potential peace negotiations? Well, that's a great question and much of it depends on what's [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=38.0s)]
*  in the mind of not President Putin but President Trump. The political site, Axios, citing sources [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  who discussed it with him, say President Trump called those Ukrainian drone strikes badass [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=53.6s)]
*  and strong but is concerned that those strikes will make a ceasefire harder. So the war continues [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=59.36s)]
*  and so does a propaganda battle with Ukraine releasing more details of that attack on Russian [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=66.88s)]
*  bombers while Russia claiming clearly, falsely or from the images that all the planes can be repaired. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=72.16s)]
*  President Trump and President Putin offering their first public reaction as new video emerges of [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=78.24s)]
*  Ukraine's drone attack that devastated some of Russia's deadly long-range bomber fleet. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=87.28s)]
*  The more than four minutes of footage released by the Ukrainian security service shows additional [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=93.28s)]
*  Russian aircraft targeted, including what appears to be an A-50 spy plane. After an hour and 15-minute [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=98.8s)]
*  phone call between the two men, Trump's saying Putin told him, quote, very strongly Russia will [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=105.44s)]
*  have to respond. Moscow has launched an onslaught of air attacks in recent weeks. This latest video, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=110.88s)]
*  the aftermath of a Russian drone and missile attack on Kharkiv in just the last 24 hours, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=118.08s)]
*  Trump did not say whether he tried to persuade Putin against another deadly offensive. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=123.84s)]
*  Despite close to a million Russian military casualties, 400,000 Ukrainian soldiers, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=129.6s)]
*  according to a new report, and President Trump's long-standing conviction that Putin [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=135.84s)]
*  was ready to end the war. I believe Putin wants to do it. And if I thought that [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=140.72s)]
*  President Putin did not want to get this over with, I wouldn't even be talking about it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=145.76s)]
*  Trump said his call with the Russian leader was not a conversation that will immediately lead to [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=151.52s)]
*  peace. That impasse did not prevent them from discussing cooperation on other issues like Iran [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=157.04s)]
*  nuclear negotiations. Iran's close relations with Russia, along with China and North Korea, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=163.04s)]
*  has been dubbed an axis of resistance. President Zelensky warning Putin feels impunity and that [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  Russia is, quote, giving the finger to the entire world. We just have to pressure on him, and maybe [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=175.76s)]
*  we will get peace. President Zelensky handing out medals. His message, Ukraine can keep fighting. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=183.28s)]
*  And now back to that drone strike, top Ukrainian officials insisting that 41 Russian aircraft were [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=194.96s)]
*  destroyed or damaged. So far, vision evidence is not available to confirm that number. The Russian [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  spy plane that you saw there, for example, in the footage you don't actually see it on fire, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=206.24s)]
*  but there is other footage which shows Ukraine targeting Russian planes that at that moment [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=211.12s)]
*  are loaded with bombs. Anna? Right, Keir Simmons. Thank you. Joining us now is Igor Novikov. He's [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=217.52s)]
*  been key. He's the former adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Igor, it's good to [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=223.84s)]
*  have you with us. Ceasefire negotiations seem to be at a standstill right now. Russia's already [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=229.28s)]
*  stepped up its bombardment of Ukrainian cities, vowing further retaliation after that massive [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=235.04000000000002s)]
*  attack. What are the Ukrainian people bracing for to happen next? Well, I'm pretty sure nothing we [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=239.84s)]
*  haven't seen before on one hand. On the other hand, obviously, Putin is angry about what happens [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=246.24s)]
*  in the operation Spiderweb. But unfortunately, that's the only thing we can do. We need to [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=252.8s)]
*  make sure that the cost of this war for Putin is unbearable. And since we don't have as much [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=257.84000000000003s)]
*  support as we had from the West, we have to basically use the asymmetrical war tactics. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=262.32s)]
*  I mean, it was like something out of a spy thriller, that that operation Spiderweb. How big of a [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=269.36s)]
*  morale boost was that for Ukraine? And I guess conversely, are you worried about setbacks when [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=274.0s)]
*  it comes to reaching a ceasefire? Well, I don't believe in ceasefire until autumn, to be honest, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=279.92s)]
*  because Putin is not interested in that. In the conventional warfare, he does have advantage at [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=287.12s)]
*  the moment, hence our asymmetrical attacks. Plus, I don't think President Trump is really [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=291.76s)]
*  helping because if you analyze what he said, he basically said the operation was badass. So continue [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=297.04s)]
*  doing that. Putin's going to strike in retaliation. Well, nothing I can do about it. But guys, I want [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=302.72s)]
*  peace. I mean, that doesn't work like that. So we know President Trump and Putin spoke for more than [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=308.96000000000004s)]
*  an hour, but President Trump didn't say whether he tried to persuade Putin from retaliating. What [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=314.72s)]
*  do you make of the U.S. involvement at this point? Well, it's absolutely horrific. I mean, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=320.88s)]
*  that statement I saw from him on Truth Social, because basically what he's saying is, you know, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=326.32s)]
*  a dictator just said, I'm going to murder a bunch of civilians because if anyone's got any doubts, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=331.28s)]
*  he's going to attack civilians rather than the military targets. You just wait and see. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=335.6s)]
*  And the president of the United States, you know, the leader of the free world just said, well, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=340.96s)]
*  he just told me that. I didn't say anything in return. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=345.91999999999996s)]
*  Igor Novikov, thanks so much. Thank you for giving us this Pulse Check from Ukraine and [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=349.67999999999995s)]
*  for continuing to provide that insight. We appreciate you. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=355.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIof3QpnKI&t=375.28s)]
