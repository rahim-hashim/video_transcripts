# Trump calls L.A. protestors insurrectionists, pardoned January 6th insurrectionists
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI)
*  My friend and colleague Rachel Maddow periodically reminds us that we ought to watch what they [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=0.0s)]
*  do, not what they say. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=5.32s)]
*  In this instance, though, what they're saying is at least worth reporting, telling you about. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=7.2s)]
*  Because Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller is already calling what's happening in Los [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=12.4s)]
*  Angeles a, quote, insurrection. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=15.8s)]
*  J.D. Vance tweeted about insurrectionists. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=18.2s)]
*  And Donald Trump himself, after telling a journalist yesterday that what is happening in Los Angeles [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=21.6s)]
*  is not an insurrection, proceeded to post, quote, paid insurrectionists. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=26.4s)]
*  Then this afternoon he posted again about insurrectionists. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=32.6s)]
*  It is just a word, but it is an important one, not just because invoking the Insurrection [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=37.12s)]
*  Act would be an unprecedented escalation, but also because anyone older than four years [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=42.56s)]
*  old remembers an actual insurrection and the way Trump spent his first day in office the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  second time pardoning all the rioters involved in January 6th. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=53.44s)]
*  Joining our conversation is former Republican Congressman, former advisor to the January [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=58.2s)]
*  6th Select Committee, Denver Wigelman. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=63.16s)]
*  Denver, I know you're just back from Ukraine, and I promise we'll get to that in a second. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=64.56s)]
*  But your thoughts on this moment unfolding? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=70.12s)]
*  You know, you just said it when they said insurrectionists, what they are setting up [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=73.2s)]
*  is the Insurrection Act. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=76.28s)]
*  You know, right before the election, we were wargaming a lot of this with a lot of groups [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=77.44s)]
*  in the sort of let's protect democracy movement. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=82.44s)]
*  I remember I was doing one with Bill Kristol and we were talking about the Insurrection [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=85.32s)]
*  Act and how we thought there would be some type of motivation or some type of escalation, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=88.64s)]
*  maybe even artificial escalation to get to that point. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=93.6s)]
*  And what you're seeing, Nicole, is the use of the word insurrection to get to what they [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=95.84s)]
*  hope is the Insurrection Act, because that's something that it seemed that President Trump [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=100.08s)]
*  has been wanting to do since he took office the first time in 2016. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=103.92s)]
*  Also, when you look at insurrection, they're trying to take the language of what happened [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=107.47999999999999s)]
*  on January 6th. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=111.3s)]
*  I saw an insurrection and there are gradations, right? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=112.78s)]
*  There's common sense, Nicole, right? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=115.46s)]
*  If you're stealing something and you steal a Snickers bar or you steal a vehicle, those [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=117.34s)]
*  are two very different things. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=121.25999999999999s)]
*  And what they're trying to do is they're trying to apply the escalation of violence or the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=123.25999999999999s)]
*  deliberate, I would say the deliberate escalation, right, of activity with the National Guard [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=126.78s)]
*  to an insurrection when you have people that are actually going against the escalation [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=132.7s)]
*  of that violence from the government rather than the proactive measures of the January [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=136.57999999999998s)]
*  6th insurrectionists who planned it, whether they're Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, the other [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=140.86s)]
*  white nationalist groups, rally planners, all the people that were involved that we [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=143.86s)]
*  know of from text messages all the way to phone records. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=147.58s)]
*  So I think that's what you're seeing, Nicole, is exactly that, which was brilliant, right, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=151.14000000000001s)]
*  is they're trying to take the language of January 6th, but they're also trying to frame [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=154.9s)]
*  the need for the Insurrection Act with the escalation of violence that they hope happens [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=158.42000000000002s)]
*  based on the National Guard being in that area. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=162.78s)]
*  I don't say this a lot, so when I get to say it, I'm going to say it out loud and twice. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=165.78s)]
*  I agree with Cash Patel. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=170.26s)]
*  I agree with Cash Patel. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=171.66s)]
*  He tweeted this. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=173.1s)]
*  Hit a cop, you're going to jail. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=174.1s)]
*  Doesn't matter where you came from, how you got there, what movement speaks to you. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=176.06s)]
*  If the local police force won't back our men and women on the thin blue line, the FBI will. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=179.54s)]
*  It would be wonderful if Cash Patel said that to Harry Dunn's face or Michael Fanon's face [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=184.45999999999998s)]
*  or any of the other dozens of officers who defended the United States Capitol on January [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=189.85999999999999s)]
*  6th. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=195.06s)]
*  Do you think they think their own base is stupid? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=196.06s)]
*  Do you think they think we don't know what happened on January 6th? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=199.14s)]
*  How did they say those things without caring about the officers that were hit by Trump's [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=203.18s)]
*  supporters on January 6th? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=208.1s)]
*  It's the thing that really bothers me. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=211.98s)]
*  Harry was with me in Ukraine, Nicole. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=214.01999999999998s)]
*  I don't know if he knew that or not. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=215.38s)]
*  I don't know if anybody's been around Harry Dunn, but I don't think Cash Patel is going [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=218.1s)]
*  to tell Harry Dunn to his face that, based on what happened, right? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=220.98s)]
*  Or Fanon, Michael, for that matter. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=224.01999999999998s)]
*  The fact is he's just full of crap, right? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=227.3s)]
*  This is them trying to set up another narrative outside of what really happened on January [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=230.18s)]
*  6th, but it's lying. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=234.02s)]
*  You know, it's just sort of this pathological need for machismo that comes out of a lot [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=235.02s)]
*  of these individuals, right, who I don't think could make the JV baseball team. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=239.70000000000002s)]
*  That's really what we have here. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=243.92000000000002s)]
*  And what you're seeing with this type of chest thumping, again, is gearing up to what you're [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=245.42000000000002s)]
*  seeing in LA and what they hope to happen, which is them actually rolling in and some [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=250.16000000000003s)]
*  of the campaign promises that President Trump wanted to actually keep, but he's trying to [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=255.14s)]
*  make them happen based on the National Guard being deployed. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=259.34s)]
*  So yeah, Cash Patel's full of crap, and he shouldn't be there anyway. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=263.14s)]
*  But what you have is somebody who really has no sense of what he's saying or he absolutely [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=265.98s)]
*  doesn't. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=271.65999999999997s)]
*  It's the cynicism of what they did to the police officers on the Capitol steps on January [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=272.65999999999997s)]
*  6th. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=276.98s)]
*  And now he's saying this ridiculousness, like somehow there's some parallel where they've [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=277.98s)]
*  completely forgotten or trying to whitewash this. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=280.98s)]
*  So you're right, Nicole, they think we're stupid. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=283.74s)]
*  But you know, there's a whole huge portion of the population who just really doesn't [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=286.46000000000004s)]
*  care what's happening in LA. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=290.52s)]
*  They just don't care. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=291.82s)]
*  They are living their lives. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=293.26s)]
*  They voted for Trump over 77 million people. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=294.26s)]
*  And I think what they're saying to them is something that they say, I voted for this. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=296.22s)]
*  And that's what I'm seeing on social media is this sort of rah rah, I voted for this [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=299.42s)]
*  while showing pictures of people running from law enforcement. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=303.54s)]
*  And I got to tell you, that should bother every American if that's where we're going [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=307.14s)]
*  as a country. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=310.74s)]
*  What do we do about that? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=311.98s)]
*  You know, I was listening to the prior segment. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=314.98s)]
*  I know John was talking about the midterms and listen to Eddie. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=316.58s)]
*  But what we have to do about that, I told people that we're almost to the point of intellectual [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=319.14s)]
*  house to house fighting where you have to be confrontational with people. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursd88z0-KI&t=322.94s)]
