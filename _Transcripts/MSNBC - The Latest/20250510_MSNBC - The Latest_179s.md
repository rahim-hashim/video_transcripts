# India and Pakistan agree to ceasefire after days of fighting
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ELN_3QhCvk)
*  India and Pakistan have agreed to a ceasefire after days of conflict. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ELN_3QhCvk&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump announcing a short time ago the two nations have agreed to a quote [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ELN_3QhCvk&t=4.66s)]
*  full and immediate ceasefire following quote a long night of talks mediated by [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ELN_3QhCvk&t=8.52s)]
*  the United States. Now this de-escalation comes as both sides reported multiple [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ELN_3QhCvk&t=13.32s)]
*  casualties following an exchange of missile strikes overnight marking the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ELN_3QhCvk&t=17.84s)]
*  sharpest escalation since the confrontation ignited earlier this week. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ELN_3QhCvk&t=21.72s)]
*  NBC's Matt Bradley joins us now. Matt how is the ceasefire holding up at this [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ELN_3QhCvk&t=24.96s)]
*  hour and how did it come together because obviously the fear with any two [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ELN_3QhCvk&t=29.88s)]
*  nuclear powers is escalation. Yeah I mean Christina this is a really sensitive [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ELN_3QhCvk&t=33.92s)]
*  tenuous situation because the ceasefire isn't necessarily holding up all that [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ELN_3QhCvk&t=39.8s)]
*  well right now we just heard from Omar Abdullah he is the chief minister of [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ELN_3QhCvk&t=43.96s)]
*  Jammu and Kashmir and he just posted on X about an hour ago maybe a little more [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ELN_3QhCvk&t=48.76s)]
*  than an hour ago he said and he's the highest elected official in Indian [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ELN_3QhCvk&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  controlled Kashmir he wrote what the hell just happened to the ceasefire [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ELN_3QhCvk&t=58.38s)]
*  explosions heard across Srinagar that's the capital of Indian controlled [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ELN_3QhCvk&t=61.82s)]
*  Kashmir there is no this is no ceasefire he said the air defense units in the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ELN_3QhCvk&t=65.46000000000001s)]
*  middle of Srinagar just opened up so this is a very dangerous situation it's [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ELN_3QhCvk&t=70.10000000000001s)]
*  too early to say that the ceasefire is holding but Christina it's also too [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ELN_3QhCvk&t=74.02000000000001s)]
*  early to say that the ceasefire is not holding because when you see these [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ELN_3QhCvk&t=78.58s)]
*  situations when we've had them in the past there is always kind of a period [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ELN_3QhCvk&t=82.14s)]
*  where different units scattered across this large frontline called the line of [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ELN_3QhCvk&t=86.06s)]
*  control maybe didn't get the message maybe you're still fighting maybe you're [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ELN_3QhCvk&t=90.74000000000001s)]
*  getting misperceptions about incoming fire so we have to give it some time [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ELN_3QhCvk&t=95.06s)]
*  before we can see whether or not these aberrations are going to be forgiven or [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ELN_3QhCvk&t=98.94s)]
*  whether or not the ceasefire may indeed not hold but again you know as you're [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ELN_3QhCvk&t=103.54s)]
*  talking about this was some real whiplash all day today because we started [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ELN_3QhCvk&t=107.26s)]
*  off this Saturday hearing from the Indian side and the Pakistani side that [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ELN_3QhCvk&t=110.94s)]
*  the other side had been targeting their air bases their military bases with [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ELN_3QhCvk&t=115.14s)]
*  drones and with missiles it looked as though when we started the day that this [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ELN_3QhCvk&t=119.3s)]
*  was going to be a real escalation and all of South Asia really the entire [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ELN_3QhCvk&t=124.22s)]
*  world was was dreading seeing these two nuclear powers which are now have [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ELN_3QhCvk&t=128.06s)]
*  exchanged in the past two and a half weeks the most fire that they have in [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ELN_3QhCvk&t=133.04s)]
*  the past several decades that they could come to a real all-out war of the kind [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ELN_3QhCvk&t=136.82s)]
*  that we haven't seen for several years but it looks as though thanks to [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ELN_3QhCvk&t=141.38s)]
*  mediation by the Trump administration and by the Gulf countries the Arabian [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ELN_3QhCvk&t=145.42s)]
*  or Persian Gulf countries that this is now both sides have now stepped back [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ELN_3QhCvk&t=150.22s)]
*  from the brink but this was and remains a very dangerous situation Christina [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ELN_3QhCvk&t=154.29999999999998s)]
*  you [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ELN_3QhCvk&t=171.38s)]
