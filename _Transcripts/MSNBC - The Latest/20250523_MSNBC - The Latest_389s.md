# 'Complete and total corruption': Trump's dinner with crypto investors raising major ethics concerns
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c)
*  Meanwhile, President Trump is raising major ethics questions this morning after he hosted [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=0.0s)]
*  a private dinner last night with the highest paying customers of his cryptocurrency. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=4.8s)]
*  Attendees were among the top 220 holders of the Trump coin, that meme coin. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=10.0s)]
*  The average participant spent $1.8 million to be at this dinner, according to the blockchain [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=16.06s)]
*  analyst firm, Nansen. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=21.88s)]
*  Now, Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut called it, quote, the biggest corruption scandal [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=24.2s)]
*  in the history of the White House. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=28.439999999999998s)]
*  In response to all this, White House Press Secretary Caroline Levitt is denying any conflicts [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=30.56s)]
*  of interest, saying Trump attended this dinner in his personal capacity. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=34.84s)]
*  Joining us now, Democratic Congressman Robert Garcia of California. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=39.4s)]
*  Congressman Garcia, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  Your reaction to this crypto dinner at one of the president's golf properties last night. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=45.64s)]
*  I mean, complete and total corruption on the president's part and on the part of his family. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=52.16s)]
*  You know, it's a joke to say that it's in his personal capacity when the White House [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=57.24s)]
*  is owned by the American people and the public and the taxpayers. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=61.52s)]
*  That's who the White House actually represents. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=65.24000000000001s)]
*  And let's look at what just happened. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=67.84s)]
*  I mean, first, just early that morning, we had Donald Trump and his allies do the largest [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=69.36s)]
*  single wealth transfer from working class families and middle class families to the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=75.56s)]
*  top one percent and billionaires in this country in that massive tax plan that passed [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=80.08s)]
*  the House. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=86.48s)]
*  That very plan is going to cut Medicaid by 13 million for 13 million people across this [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=87.48s)]
*  country are going to lose their health care because of that tax plan. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=93.6s)]
*  Billionaires are going to get richer and working class families are going to have less. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=98.36s)]
*  And that very single night on the same day that they're actually cutting taxes for the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=101.56s)]
*  very ultra rich, he is hosting some of the richest people, not just in the country, but [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=105.92s)]
*  on Earth, foreign government dignitaries who we don't know who they are. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=111.12s)]
*  There's no list. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=116.04s)]
*  There's no transparency. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=117.12s)]
*  And all of these people we know are dumping in fortunes to support this cryptocurrency [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=118.12s)]
*  meme coin that Donald Trump and his family launched. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=124.4s)]
*  And at the same time, he's accepting for, you know, as we know, these enormous for these [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=127.12s)]
*  $400 billion airplanes to his own government, which he cannot do, not legally allowed to [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=131.6s)]
*  do by Qatar. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=138.6s)]
*  And so this is all complete corruption. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=139.6s)]
*  It must be stopped. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=141.6s)]
*  And I want to come back to where you went with this, which is this massive tax cut and [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=143.24s)]
*  spending bill in the House that was passed yesterday. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=147.0s)]
*  Let's talk about what your party plans to do about it. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=150.12s)]
*  Rahm Emanuel, former White House chief of staff to President Obama, writes this in The [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=152.2s)]
*  Washington Post, quote, We can't chase every shiny bobble. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=156.01999999999998s)]
*  We need to laser focus on points that will deliver strategic value. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=159.88s)]
*  This is our opportunity to define Trump and his congressional enablers. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=165.24s)]
*  In this situation, less is more. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=169.32s)]
*  Democrats don't need to produce a whole budget plan. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=172.24s)]
*  Do you agree? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=175.2s)]
*  Look, I think this is very clearly what this moment is about. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=176.2s)]
*  Our party is about families over billionaires, and the Republican Party is focused on everything [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=181.6s)]
*  they can do to transfer wealth from middle-class families to the billionaires and large corporations [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=186.8s)]
*  in this country. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=192.56s)]
*  And we're going to have over 13 million people lose their health care. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=193.56s)]
*  Millions more are going to lose food assistance because Republicans are more interested in [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=198.72s)]
*  enriching the very rich in this country than actually supporting working people. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=203.60000000000002s)]
*  And look at the promises already broken. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=208.26000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump came into office saying that he was going to lower the cost of goods and [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=210.20000000000002s)]
*  prices. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=214.52s)]
*  The opposite is true. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=215.64000000000001s)]
*  The cost of goods are going up. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=216.84s)]
*  His tariff policy is chaos, and we know prices will continue to go up. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=218.88000000000002s)]
*  And so I think us focusing on this is incredibly important because this is what actually the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=222.88000000000002s)]
*  American people are going to see. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  And it is cruel and inhumane that we are willing to take and rip away the health care of people [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=229.84s)]
*  in this country so that the billionaires can be richer and more wealthier. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=235.84s)]
*  And that is exactly what Donald Trump is doing. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=239.86s)]
*  I hear you sharpening the message there, Congressman. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=241.64000000000001s)]
*  The Congressional Budget Office, to your point, says this bill will cause 8 million [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=244.12s)]
*  people to lose their health insurance by 2034 because of those Medicaid changes. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=247.68s)]
*  So if your party regains power, though, don't you need a concrete plan to get their coverage [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=254.0s)]
*  back? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=259.2s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=260.2s)]
*  And by the way, and that number will only grow over time. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=261.2s)]
*  And it's not just by the way, just the Medicaid, as we all know. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=264.52s)]
*  They are systematically destroying the Affordable Care Act, which so many people in this country [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=268.0s)]
*  So it's much broader than that. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=273.44s)]
*  But what we have to have as Democrats is we've got to fight like hell every single day to [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=274.88s)]
*  hold Republicans accountable for their actions. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=280.52000000000004s)]
*  And we will. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=283.0s)]
*  We've got to make sure that we are doing the right kind of oversight over the Republican [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=284.0s)]
*  Party, but also Donald Trump and his family for the outrageous corruption that they're [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=287.32s)]
*  doing in the White House. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=291.20000000000005s)]
*  And the American public is starting to see that House Republicans are only interested [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=292.88s)]
*  in enriching Donald Trump, his family and billionaires. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=297.58000000000004s)]
*  We have to as a party focus on working class people, on middle class families and on the [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=301.02s)]
*  issues that they care about. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=305.46s)]
*  And that is, can they afford the cost of goods and groceries at the store? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=306.65999999999997s)]
*  Can they afford to pay the rent or buy their first home, which we know is so much more [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=310.85999999999996s)]
*  difficult now for people across this country? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=315.38s)]
*  Those are the issues that the American public care about. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=317.7s)]
*  And Donald Trump is doing nothing, nothing to help average families in this country. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=320.28s)]
*  You mentioned the important responsibility of oversight. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=324.59999999999997s)]
*  Sadly, we lost one of your colleagues this week, Jerry Connolly, who stepped down from [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=328.94s)]
*  his role as ranking member on the Oversight Committee earlier this year. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=333.14s)]
*  I know you serve on that committee. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=336.9s)]
*  Would you be interested in that leadership role? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=339.09999999999997s)]
*  Look, I think right now, obviously, I just want to say that Jerry Connolly was an incredible [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=341.42s)]
*  leader of our Oversight Committee. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=346.7s)]
*  And I think we actually just lost him, which is an incredible tragedy for our caucus. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=348.5s)]
*  And so I think right now all of our focus is on him and his family and our prayers go [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=352.42s)]
*  out to his family and the people that he represented, particularly his love of his state and his [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=356.9s)]
*  country was a mention. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=362.82s)]
*  So I think that's where our focus is right now. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=363.82s)]
*  Congressman Robert Garcia, thank you so much for your time. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=365.74s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaYKgWIZp2c&t=368.54s)]
