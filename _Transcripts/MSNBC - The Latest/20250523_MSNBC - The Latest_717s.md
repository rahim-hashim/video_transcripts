# ‘The world needs fixing’: College graduations see protests, acts of defiance
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw)
*  It is graduation season and the current crop of young people walking across that stage [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=0.0s)]
*  this spring have grown up with Donald Trump as the commander in chief or the campaigner [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=5.9s)]
*  denying his election loss for most of their lives. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=12.1s)]
*  And so there is no doubt that he will leave a mark on a generation of young adults who [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=16.6s)]
*  have watched a man voted twice into office, smash norms, stoke division, seek retribution, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=21.5s)]
*  and ignore the Constitution and the rule of law. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=28.12s)]
*  I've been freaking out a lot about this speech, honestly. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=32.42s)]
*  And as I search my heart today in addressing you all, my moral and political commitments [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=37.72s)]
*  guide me to say that the only thing that is appropriate to say in this time and to a group [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=48.0s)]
*  this large is a recognition of the atrocities currently happening in Palestine. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=54.76s)]
*  This world is yours now and this world needs fixing. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=62.96s)]
*  And I pray to the heavens that you are the fixers. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=67.18s)]
*  I call upon the class of 2025 to withhold donations and continue advocating for disclosure [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=71.76s)]
*  and divestment. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=76.4s)]
*  You've used disappointment to sharpen your convictions. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=78.12s)]
*  You now know with more certainty what you believe and what you refuse to accept. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=82.64s)]
*  We saw how policies that claim to optimize actually traumatize. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=89.48s)]
*  And we saw how those in charge abandoned their obligation to defend free expression and to [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=94.4s)]
*  protect the people they pledge to serve. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=99.14s)]
*  Young people are always watching adults for guidance about guardrails and decorum and [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=102.56s)]
*  what do they see under Donald Trump. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=108.4s)]
*  Adults cheered a man who made fun of people with disabilities. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=111.04s)]
*  Adults looked the other way when he talked about grabbing women by their private parts. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=114.64s)]
*  Adults continued to accept and exalt a man who was twice impeached and convicted of 34 [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=119.48s)]
*  felonies. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  Adults continued to support his agenda around immigration even though it smashed constitutional [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=126.30000000000001s)]
*  notions of due process. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=131.2s)]
*  Adults, even those who expressed reservations, supported his agenda to provide tax cuts to [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=134.56s)]
*  the rich and enact massive cuts in programs for the poor and the elderly. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=140.20000000000002s)]
*  Not all adults, of course, but enough of them went to the voting booth to say all of this [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=145.56s)]
*  is condoned and acceptable. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=150.16000000000003s)]
*  Even when the threats and the vows of retribution became more heated and more common, they returned [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=152.76000000000002s)]
*  him to office. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=158.16000000000003s)]
*  And then those same adults remained silent while the administration lectured the nation [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=159.60000000000002s)]
*  about the need for merit-based ideologies while appointing a litany of leaders who are [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=164.36s)]
*  manifestly un- or under-qualified for cabinet positions. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=169.24s)]
*  At the same time, this administration dismantled DEI programs because diversity, equity, and [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=173.96s)]
*  inclusion initiatives allegedly discriminate against white Americans, a claim made with [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=179.88000000000002s)]
*  no proof, all bombast, no facts. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=184.96s)]
*  The kids who have grown up under Trump's shadow have inherited a world that is undeniably [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=188.62s)]
*  diverse. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=193.16000000000003s)]
*  This young generation is the most diverse cohort America has ever produced, but they [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=194.96s)]
*  are walking into a world where the very word diversity has been demonized and weaponized [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=198.68s)]
*  to systematically cauterize the civil rights and human rights gains that should have been [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=204.96s)]
*  their true inheritance. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=209.88s)]
*  Instead, what will they inherit from more than a decade of Trump's ascendancy and takeover [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=211.68s)]
*  of the Republican Party? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=216.42s)]
*  Graduates marching across stages this spring are strutting into an uncertain job market [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=218.82s)]
*  in a tumultuous economy. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=223.88s)]
*  They and their children and their aging baby boomer and Gen X parents are less likely to [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=225.68s)]
*  have solid health care or benefit from research-based medical advancement. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=230.64s)]
*  Let's remember that 55% of higher education research is, or perhaps we should say was, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=235.56s)]
*  funded by the federal government. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=242.88s)]
*  This administration's slash and burn and flail around a chainsaw approach to federal programs [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=245.35999999999999s)]
*  was ostensibly to cut waste, fraud, and abuse. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=250.52s)]
*  The real goal, however, was really about providing more tax cuts for ultra-wealthy Americans. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  It has done little to gild the futures of everyday American kids. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=260.18s)]
*  And even with all of this, Donald Trump made significant inroads with Gen Z voters in the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=264.72s)]
*  last election. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=268.82s)]
*  There's been a lot of analysis on the Gen Z voters who gravitated toward Donald Trump [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=269.82s)]
*  in the November election, but less so on the impact that his leadership has had on their [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=274.64s)]
*  psychics or their outlook in life. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=279.46s)]
*  Now we wish the best for all graduates this year, from universities, from trade schools, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=282.73999999999995s)]
*  military academies, community colleges, and high schools. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=287.62s)]
*  The hills may be steeper for some of you, but sometimes it's easier to find your stride [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=290.85999999999996s)]
*  when you're charging uphill. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=295.14s)]
*  We hope you find your best selves. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=296.97999999999996s)]
*  And we hope that the adults who are now running things find a way to give the so-called Trump [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=299.09999999999997s)]
*  generation the opportunities in life that you all deserve. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=303.78s)]
*  Let me also say that we firmly believe that our international students have the same rights [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=310.06s)]
*  to freedom of speech as everyone else, and they should not be targeted by the government [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=318.02s)]
*  for exercising that right. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=325.53999999999996s)]
*  Students at Columbia University let their school's acting president know exactly how [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=329.34s)]
*  they felt during graduation proceedings earlier this week. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=333.38s)]
*  They expressed dissatisfaction with the school's capitulation to the Trump administration, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=336.66s)]
*  as well as the continued detention of student and lawful resident Mahmoud Khalil. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=340.94s)]
*  Contrast that with the scene at Morehouse College in Atlanta this week. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=346.42s)]
*  The school decided to empower its student body by giving graduates the opportunity to [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=350.04s)]
*  introduce themselves and share their own accomplishment as they take the next step into their futures. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=354.86s)]
*  Tressie McMillan-Cottam is a professor at UNC Chapel Hill and an opinion columnist for [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=362.02s)]
*  the New York Times. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=370.14s)]
*  She joins me now. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=371.14s)]
*  I'm such a big fan of your work. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=372.14s)]
*  I'm so glad you were with me for this conversation. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=373.14s)]
*  In your experience as a professor, how have the Trump years shaped the way young people [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=376.26s)]
*  see the world? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=382.38s)]
*  Pleasure to be here with you, by the way. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=384.38s)]
*  Michelle, you look wonderful in the chair, by the way. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=386.9s)]
*  Listen, it was heartbreaking to hear you call this the Trump generation, by the way. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=390.3s)]
*  I was of that moment where we were talking about the Obama generation and how we would [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=395.26s)]
*  have this generation of children who had never known an America without a black president [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=400.06s)]
*  and all the possibility that portended for our multiracial future. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=406.62s)]
*  To hear about or to consider what a Trump generation will learn from us and as an analog [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=413.7s)]
*  to what we had hoped they'd learned about us from the Obama years is a bit heartbreaking. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=421.74s)]
*  When I talk to young people in particular, keeping in mind that college students come [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=429.26s)]
*  in a wide range in varieties, but in young people in particular, there is this sense [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=433.53999999999996s)]
*  that we prepared them for an America that does not exist. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=439.22s)]
*  So when we talk about how they are much more accepting of sexual minorities, for example, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=444.02s)]
*  that didn't fall out of the sky. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=449.14s)]
*  They came through K through 12 where they learned these lessons about how you treat [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=451.22s)]
*  other people and to be accepting and how we were supposed to treat people that were different [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=455.22s)]
*  from us only to arrive in college and find out that not only was that not the reality, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=460.74s)]
*  but the very things they had been taught to value now makes them targets in their own [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=469.06s)]
*  country either because they are those people, they embody those identities and those lived [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=474.58s)]
*  experiences or because they sympathize or empathize with those people. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=479.22s)]
*  So there's a sense of loss of trust, not just between generations, but I think between young [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=484.65999999999997s)]
*  people and what they think is possible for them in the United States of America. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=490.9s)]
*  And frankly, that is heartbreaking. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=496.18s)]
*  Every news cycle we're talking about the shattering of norms of one kind or another. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=499.06s)]
*  And the word normal is always, it should be a laundry setting. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=504.47999999999996s)]
*  I mean, it's not, it's a word that you have to be careful when you use because norms are [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=507.86s)]
*  always changing, but they're usually not getting shattered in this way. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=512.22s)]
*  And so what may seem abnormal to people who remember a different standard and a different [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=514.94s)]
*  set of decorum, particularly from the oval officer from the White House is perhaps fairly [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=520.22s)]
*  normal to the young people who've grown up with. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=525.6600000000001s)]
*  And Donald Trump has been president running for office president again. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=529.34s)]
*  This has been the person that has held the highest office in the land or has been seeking [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=533.26s)]
*  that office for a very long time. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=538.0600000000001s)]
*  What does that mean in terms of the norms or the ideas that they might have around what [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=540.22s)]
*  is acceptable and what is not acceptable in terms of the way that they treat their fellow [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=546.0600000000001s)]
*  human beings in terms of the way they see the world in themselves? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=550.62s)]
*  We cannot overstate the importance that sort of like internet culture did to already sort [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=554.5400000000001s)]
*  of destabilizing the norms of what was acceptable discourse, who was an acceptable victim of [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=560.62s)]
*  targeted harassment, that kind of thing. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=567.82s)]
*  And that had just been allowed to sort of simmer beneath the surface of I think our [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=569.9000000000001s)]
*  cultural awareness in this country. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=574.38s)]
*  But in so many ways, Donald Trump embodies what for some of us was gamergate or if you [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=576.62s)]
*  spend any time in sort of online communities, the sort of culture of using humor to get away [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=582.5400000000001s)]
*  with transgressing those norms that you talk about. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=588.7s)]
*  Donald Trump takes that and he sort of levels this up to the legitimacy of the highest office [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=591.9000000000001s)]
*  in this country. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=598.1400000000001s)]
*  And I think for a lot of young people, what they see in that is that one, if you can get [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=599.34s)]
*  away with it, then it is normal, which I would point out is an absolute horrible way for [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=605.18s)]
*  social cohesion to work, right? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=610.78s)]
*  For us to cohere as a multiracial democracy, it takes a certain amount of risking failure [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=614.46s)]
*  in reaching out to one another. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=620.9399999999999s)]
*  And Donald Trump embodying that there are no bounds to your bad behavior if you have [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=623.0200000000001s)]
*  enough power, enough wealth, enough status, enough prestige to get away with it. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=629.74s)]
*  That is a lesson that runs counter, by the way, to our idea of meritocracy, runs counter [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=635.74s)]
*  to our idea of ourselves as a compassionate nation. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=640.86s)]
*  But it is hard to argue against the fact that he is winning with that type of behavior. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=644.46s)]
*  And we talk of, if anyone has ever raised children, you've heard that they don't hear [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=651.5s)]
*  what you say, they hear what you do. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=657.42s)]
*  They watch what you do. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=659.9s)]
*  That's right. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=662.06s)]
*  We can communicate these messages all day. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=662.78s)]
*  But if we reward the behavior that allows you to ascend to the top of the political, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=665.5s)]
*  economic, and cultural hierarchy of the United States of America, then that is what we are [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=671.26s)]
*  endorsing. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=675.98s)]
*  When those norms are gone, this is something that troubles me. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=677.26s)]
*  It is not easy to rebuild them. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=680.86s)]
*  And that is something I'm not sure that young people understand. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=684.7s)]
*  But then I'm not sure that the rest of us quite understand and appreciate that either. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=687.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to475PsE2kw&t=710.86s)]
