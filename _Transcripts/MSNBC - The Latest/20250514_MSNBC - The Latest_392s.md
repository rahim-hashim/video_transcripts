# 'Not a gift, it's pure, unshameful corruption': Ex-Dem lawmaker on Trump accepting Qatari jet
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY)
*  Let's discuss with Lindsey Drath, CEO of the Forward Party and former director of the National Finance Committee at the RNC and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=0.0s)]
*  former Democratic congressman from New York and senior adviser with Vote Vets, Max Rose. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  Congressman, I want to play what Senator Tupperville [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=13.72s)]
*  said in his objection to this resolution by Senator Schatz. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=17.68s)]
*  It is customary and totally normal for foreign countries to give our government gifts. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=22.88s)]
*  The DOJ has already said that this does not violate any law. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=29.88s)]
*  So why are my colleagues and the woke media having a full-blown meltdown over this situation? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=35.879999999999995s)]
*  Congressman, what do you make of that logic? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  Tell me something else. It's not a gift. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  Tell me something else. Look, it's not a gift. And that's been the principal issue with how Democrats are framing this. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=48.88s)]
*  It's not a goodwill gesture. It's pure, unshameful corruption. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=54.88s)]
*  It's transactional right in front of us. Whatever happened to draining the swamp here? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=60.88s)]
*  So there's absolutely no reason in God's green earth why Qatar or any other country for that matter [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=65.88s)]
*  would just give a $400 million item to the president of the United States. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=71.88s)]
*  Keep in mind, this is not a gift to the United States government. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=77.88s)]
*  Donald Trump gets to take this with him to his presidential library in 2029. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=80.88s)]
*  Even if it were going to stay in federal custody, would that make it OK? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=85.88s)]
*  No, not in any way, shape or form. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=90.88s)]
*  This is a direct transactional item solicited by Donald Trump for God knows what. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=93.88s)]
*  And even if we may never know what the other side of the transaction is, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=100.88s)]
*  it colors every single piece of interaction, every exchange that we have with this country going forward. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=104.88s)]
*  And that just doesn't hurt our diplomatic relations with that nation, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=111.88s)]
*  but it hurts building trust with voters throughout the country in government writ large. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=115.88s)]
*  That's how deep and shameful and problematic this issue is. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=122.88s)]
*  And shame on Tommy Tuberville for actually being able to stand up there in front of people and claim this is a gift. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=127.88s)]
*  Like I just accepted a coupon or a free slice of pizza. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=133.88s)]
*  It's ridiculous. Look, Tuberville is on one side of this. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=136.88s)]
*  Not everybody in his party agrees with him. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=140.88s)]
*  In fact, Lindsay, former governor Nikki Haley is among the Republican voices coming out against the plane proposal, saying, quote, If this were Biden, we would be furious. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=143.88s)]
*  Does she have a point there? And do you see anything stopping this plan going forward? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=153.88s)]
*  I think thanks, Anna. I think that what we're seeing in Secretary Haley's response here is this idea that, well, they did it so I can do it or I'll do it because they would do it anyway. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=158.88s)]
*  And the what the congressman referenced in the general erosion of trust in our institutions amongst the American voter is a real issue here. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=171.88s)]
*  And instances like this are further eroding that the trust the American voter has in institutions. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=181.88s)]
*  And Senator Tuberville is not wrong. There is a history of American presidents receiving gifts. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=187.88s)]
*  George W. Bush famously received a puppy from a Bulgarian state leader. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=193.88s)]
*  However, he did turn that puppy over to the National Archives. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=198.88s)]
*  There are bureaucratic processes for understanding where these gifts should stay. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=201.88s)]
*  But it's a really, really different than a four hundred million dollar luxury jet to become Air Force One. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=207.88s)]
*  But the murkiness here in the rules, I think, is part of the challenge here. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=216.88s)]
*  Now, Congressman, you know, you are very familiar with the Office of Congressional Ethics. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=220.88s)]
*  There are very specific rules that govern members of Congress in terms of how they can accept gifts. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=225.88s)]
*  My goodness, they can't sit and have a dinner with someone. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=230.88s)]
*  Actually, a seated dinner is considered a different rule than a large attended event. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=234.88s)]
*  You can't use a fork, but you can use a toothpick. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=238.88s)]
*  There's very specific rules that govern gifts for members of Congress. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=240.88s)]
*  But there's a lot of murkiness around the administration and the president specifically. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=244.88s)]
*  SCOTUS experienced similar murkiness when you looked at the gifts that we discovered that Clarence Thomas had received. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=248.88s)]
*  So what we need now is greater transparency on the part of our government. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=256.88s)]
*  Congress has an opportunity here to get in and insist on greater transparency and eliminate some of the murkiness in these rules. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=260.88s)]
*  What is the murkiness in the emoluments clause of the Constitution, though? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=266.88s)]
*  Which would apply to this situation, no? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=269.88s)]
*  Well, I think it's what the congressman was referencing, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=272.88s)]
*  which is the idea that this is actually not for personal use, but rather for the good of the American people, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=274.88s)]
*  that the American people can enjoy this. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=279.88s)]
*  And certainly if you look at other presidential libraries like the Reagan Library, there are many, many gifts. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=281.88s)]
*  The Bush Library as well, where presidents have received gifts. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=285.88s)]
*  These things are now on display. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=290.88s)]
*  But a plane is not a puppy. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=291.88s)]
*  And obviously this has incredible implications for national security and national affairs. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=293.88s)]
*  So this is a very different instance, but one that I think forces the conversation. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=299.88s)]
*  And I think Congress has an opportunity to act here. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=303.88s)]
*  And I'm grateful that people like Secretary Haley are joining a bipartisan caucus of voices and speaking out against this. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=306.88s)]
*  I'll give you the last word, Max. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=314.88s)]
*  You know, I would just say here, this is the issue Democrats should be talking about. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=317.88s)]
*  As we're talking about, you know, they throw so much at us each and every day, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=323.88s)]
*  and it starts to feel a little schizophrenic on the part of the Democrats because there's so many horrendous things happening. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=328.88s)]
*  This is an 80-20 issue. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=334.88s)]
*  Donald Trump prides himself and his acolytes pride themselves on taking the right side of 80-20 issues. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=336.88s)]
*  Well, in this instance, they're on the 20 percent issue. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=342.88s)]
*  Nobody supports taking a $400 million payoff bribe from a nation overseas at the same time that you're being on the side of billionaires and cutting Medicaid. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=345.88s)]
*  It's a clear story of corruption and being against hardworking Americans. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=356.88s)]
*  That's the narrative that's going to win back the House and the Senate in just a few short years. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=362.88s)]
*  Former Congressman Max Rose and Lindsey Drath, thank you both for the conversation. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=366.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCDQDQ8JvY&t=375.88s)]
