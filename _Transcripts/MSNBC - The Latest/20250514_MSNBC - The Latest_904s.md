# Lawrence: It takes 'Trump-level stupidity' to beg for a $400M jet while advocating Medicaid cuts
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA)
*  Well, since we last convened here 24 hours ago to examine Donald Trump's humiliation [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=0.0s)]
*  tour of Middle East dictatorships, Donald Trump has uncharacteristically for him observed [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=4.68s)]
*  a 24-hour period of strict silence about his attempt to grab the single largest corrupt [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=12.84s)]
*  gift in the history of gifts, corrupt or otherwise. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=23.34s)]
*  And by largest, I mean physically largest, because Donald Trump is taking much larger [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=28.76s)]
*  financial gifts through his new cryptocurrency scam that he pretends is a business. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=35.84s)]
*  The 13-year-old 747-800, which is the largest model of 747 that Donald Trump desperately [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=42.92s)]
*  wants to accept as a gift from the dictator of Qatar, is now only worth about $400 million [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=51.28s)]
*  as it sits at the San Antonio airport in Texas, abandoned by the dictator of Qatar because [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=60.92s)]
*  it's not good enough for him anymore, but it's good enough for Donald Trump. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=67.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is currently the only person in the Middle East too stupid to understand [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=73.36s)]
*  how humiliated he is now by that 13-year-old plane that's not good enough for a dictator, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=80.16s)]
*  but is more than good enough for Donald Trump. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=88.84s)]
*  As President, Donald Trump already has access to the two best, most sophisticated 747s in [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=91.94s)]
*  the world that serve as Air Force One. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=99.5s)]
*  Donald Trump wants to spend billions of dollars converting a 13-year-old 747-800 to serve [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=103.04s)]
*  as Air Force One maybe in the last year of his presidency, like around that time, that's [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=110.12s)]
*  how long it would take at least. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=115.48s)]
*  And then he just plans to take it with him to use any way he wants after he leaves the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=117.56s)]
*  White House. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=123.16000000000001s)]
*  He took classified documents the last time he left. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=124.16000000000001s)]
*  This time he wants to take a copy of Air Force One. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=126.2s)]
*  As I have said here before, it's not going to happen. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=130.2s)]
*  Donald's not going to get his toy, but he's too stupid to know that yet. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=136.0s)]
*  Donald Trump will be the last one to realize that the dictator's 747 is never going to [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=140.64s)]
*  be converted to Air Force One. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=146.6s)]
*  Donald Trump's desperate public attempt to take this biggest payoff in history is a perfect [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=148.35999999999999s)]
*  way of illuminating to voters who Donald Trump really is. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=154.51999999999998s)]
*  This is better than anything the Democrats could say. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=160.16s)]
*  So every day Donald Trump desperately campaigns to get the dictator's plane is another bad [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=163.24s)]
*  day for Donald Trump and the Republican Party. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=170.72s)]
*  The Republican opposition to the idea of turning a dictator's plane into Air Force One will [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=175.24s)]
*  be strong enough to stop it. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=182.48s)]
*  The Republican supporting New York Post, owned by billionaire Trump supporter, Rupert Murdoch, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=185.16s)]
*  headlined its editorial, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=191.8s)]
*  The first line of that editorial says, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=200.84s)]
*  that he'll eventually own personally. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=215.84s)]
*  Own personally is in italics because that's what the deal is really about. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=219.84s)]
*  A lobbyist for the country and the dictator of Qatar, now serving as Donald Trump's Attorney [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=226.51999999999998s)]
*  General, Pam Bondi, has said in writing that the scheme is legitimate because the dictator [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=231.16s)]
*  will actually just give the plane to the Defense Department and then the Air Force will spend [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=237.44s)]
*  billions of American taxpayer dollars with Boeing to try to convert that plane to be [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=242.48s)]
*  a usable Air Force One. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=248.4s)]
*  And then at the end of Donald Trump's presidency, the Defense Department will simply give the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=250.4s)]
*  plane to Donald Trump's presidential library, which means Donald Trump will decide just [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=256.24s)]
*  who gets to fly on that plane after he is president and we know who's going to fly on [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=261.58s)]
*  that plane. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=265.32s)]
*  The biggest budget item for all of the donations that come into the Trump presidential library [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=267.6s)]
*  will be paying for the jet fuel for the dictator's 747 to fly Donald Trump wherever he wants [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=274.20000000000005s)]
*  to go in retirement. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=282.24s)]
*  That is the scheme and that is why Rupert Murdoch and the New York Post today said that [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=284.06s)]
*  it is a deal for a 747, quote, from Qatar that in effect he'll eventually own personally, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=289.56s)]
*  end quote, Rupert Murdoch's words. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=298.44s)]
*  And Rupert Murdoch's New York Post is not buying Attorney General Pam Bondi's defense [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=301.92s)]
*  that it's not a bribe. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=306.8s)]
*  The Republican New York Post says, quote, sorry, this gift is far from free. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=309.0s)]
*  Qatar will surely expect something in return and the optics are beyond awful, especially [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=314.6s)]
*  as Congress mulls hundreds of billions in Medicaid cuts. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=319.52000000000004s)]
*  The Democrats in Congress exposing those Medicaid cuts and fighting those Medicaid cuts are [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=325.84000000000003s)]
*  the real beneficiaries of the gift the dictator of Qatar has decided to give because as Donald [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=331.24s)]
*  the Republican candidate for president who promised not to cut Medicaid is supporting [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=340.32s)]
*  cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act that will rob 13 million people of health [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=345.04s)]
*  coverage. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=349.56s)]
*  At that very same time, Donald Trump is publicly begging for a $400 million gift for him from [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=350.56s)]
*  a dictator who has already given much more than that to support the terrorist organization [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=357.96000000000004s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=366.16s)]
*  It takes Trump level stupidity to create a political dynamic like that. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=368.42s)]
*  One feature of Donald Trump's stupidity is that it apparently shields him from feeling [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=376.22s)]
*  humiliation no matter how much humiliation is heaped upon him. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=381.54s)]
*  There is an obsession of Donald Trump's at work here with this plane and it is his size [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=387.78000000000003s)]
*  obsession. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=395.54s)]
*  Donald Trump has been defensively and publicly obsessed with size ever since Kurt Anderson [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=397.74s)]
*  and Graydon Carter at Spy Magazine in 1986 coined the phrase short-fingered vulgarian [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=404.26s)]
*  to describe Donald Trump. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=411.48s)]
*  As a presidential candidate in 2016, Donald Trump became the first presidential candidate [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=415.1s)]
*  to defend the size of his fingers and try to describe for us the size of something we [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=422.26s)]
*  cannot and don't want to see. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=433.78s)]
*  He's really not that much of a lightweight and as far as and I have to say this, I have [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=438.58s)]
*  to say this, he hit my hands. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=443.09999999999997s)]
*  Nobody has ever hit my hands. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=446.21999999999997s)]
*  I've never heard of this one. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=447.21999999999997s)]
*  Look at those hands. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=448.53999999999996s)]
*  They're small hands. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=449.54s)]
*  And he referred to my hands if they're small, something else must be small. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=452.78000000000003s)]
*  I guarantee you there's no problem. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=457.1s)]
*  I guarantee you. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=458.98s)]
*  The lightweight who Donald Trump was hitting back at in that Republican primary debate [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=461.5s)]
*  is now Donald Trump's Secretary of State and this is what Marco Rubio said about Donald [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=465.3s)]
*  Trump when he was running against him. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=471.70000000000005s)]
*  Donald Trump is a con artist. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=475.98s)]
*  He's taller than me. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=480.06s)]
*  He's like 6'2", which is why I don't understand why his hands are the size of someone who's [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=481.06s)]
*  5'2". [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=484.94s)]
*  Have you seen his hands? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=485.94s)]
*  They're like this. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=487.7s)]
*  And you know what they say about men with small hands? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=490.02000000000004s)]
*  You can't trust them. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=496.54s)]
*  You can't trust them. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=497.8s)]
*  You can't trust them. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=498.8s)]
*  And so we may have Donald Trump's size obsession to thank for the latest insanity he has visited [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=500.8s)]
*  upon our politics and the Constitution with his desperate attempt to take exactly the [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=506.66s)]
*  kind of gift that the Constitution says a president is not allowed to take. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=513.26s)]
*  The founders of this country who knew that there were kings across the ocean who would [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=519.02s)]
*  want to buy an American president's favor with gifts wrote into the Constitution the [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=525.58s)]
*  first law of the land that a president is not allowed to accept any gifts from any kings, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=532.86s)]
*  kings specifically mentioned in the Constitution or governments. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=540.1s)]
*  They were all watching in 2016 when Donald Trump was defending the size of his fingers [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=545.98s)]
*  to Marco Rubio and whatever else he was defending in that debate. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=552.3000000000001s)]
*  They were all watching. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=558.74s)]
*  The dictators of the world were all watching that debate. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=561.46s)]
*  And imagine the joy among the Middle Eastern dictators, the richest dictators in history [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=568.3s)]
*  when they were watching that wildly insecure man on a debate stage gesture toward who knows [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=577.34s)]
*  what below his waist to assure the world there's no problem. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=585.62s)]
*  Imagine how happy they must have been when the biggest clown they had ever seen on an [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=590.34s)]
*  American presidential debate stage became president of the United States and was so [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=595.82s)]
*  obviously easily manipulatable with flattery and money pumped into his family and camels. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=601.98s)]
*  You look at this is so beautiful as a construction person I'm seeing perfect marble. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=615.9s)]
*  This is what they call perfecto and just a great job you've done and what a beautiful [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=622.26s)]
*  place and we appreciate those camels. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=628.54s)]
*  I haven't seen camels like that in a long time. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=630.74s)]
*  He's a child. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=636.18s)]
*  A child has arrived among the Middle Eastern dictators for them to manipulate in any way [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=638.02s)]
*  they want with the thing they have unlimited supplies of money and secondhand airplanes [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=643.54s)]
*  and camels. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=652.42s)]
*  Donald Trump's 24 hours of silence about the plane could be the end of it. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=653.42s)]
*  It might be over now. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=658.02s)]
*  He might already know that a corrupt deal for a Hamas supporting dictator to give a [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=659.02s)]
*  plane to the American military will never happen. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=666.38s)]
*  There is no way that deal could survive a vote in Congress even with a Republican controlled [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=670.8199999999999s)]
*  Senate. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=676.62s)]
*  Another day another Republican senator publicly opposes Donald Trump's palace in the sky. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=677.62s)]
*  On the jet though Mano I just say this. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=685.6999999999999s)]
*  I think we ought to have a big beautiful jet but I'd like it to be made in the United [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=687.68s)]
*  States of America. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=691.54s)]
*  We can build stuff in America. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=692.6999999999999s)]
*  President Trump has been very strong on that. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=694.26s)]
*  The U.S. government ought to be buying all of our stuff in the United States of America. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=695.9399999999999s)]

*  wants to be friends with America. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=708.18s)]
*  I can think of a lot of other things Qatar could do for us like for example quit harboring [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=709.76s)]
*  Islamic jihadist terrorists who are trying to kill Americans everywhere they can get [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=714.78s)]
*  their hands on them. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=718.1999999999999s)]
*  That would probably be at the top of my list. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=719.3199999999999s)]
*  Democrats don't have to say a word about this. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=722.68s)]

*  It's been a very loyal great beautiful friendship. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=759.62s)]
*  Why are his beautiful friendships only with dictators? [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnYNCjb6QA&t=764.14s)]
