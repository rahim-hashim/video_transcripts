Video Description: Increasingly more women have been facing pregnancy-related prosecutions in the wake of Roe being overturned and reproductive rights advocate Kaitlyn Kash says people should be alarmed. “Being pregnant can be a death sentence and now you can be criminalized, it’s horrific what’s happening here,” she said. Georgetown law professor Michele Goodwin agrees with her, noting that new fetal personhood laws are holding women to “unrealistic standards.”

# ‘Being pregnant can be a death sentence’: Reproductive rights advocate Kaitlyn Kash
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo)
*  Sounds like a chapter in the Handmaid's Tale. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=0.0s)]
*  As the journalist and author Jessica Valenti said this week, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=2.4s)]
*  quote, we don't need to imagine a dystopian future where women are being used as incubators [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=5.2s)]
*  and arrested for miscarriages because that future is already here, end quote. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=9.92s)]
*  The future is already here. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  It's post-Roe America, which is turning out to be so much worse than most of us imagined [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=16.28s)]
*  it could be, not just because of the inhumanity of denying women rights over their own bodies [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  and futures or the deadly danger of forced birth, but because of the criminalization [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=25.7s)]
*  of women's bodies. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=31.86s)]
*  It's not just that women are being arrested and jailed for their miscarriages, though [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=33.14s)]
*  they are. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=37.22s)]
*  It's the creatively cruel way that they're being pursued, which is directly related to [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=38.22s)]
*  the radical anti-abortion ideology of fetal personhood that underpins the abortion bans [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=42.099999999999994s)]
*  that have spread since the fall of Roe. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=47.78s)]
*  If a fetus is legally a person, then law enforcement is empowered to criminally investigate [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=50.42s)]
*  pregnancies. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=55.86s)]
*  So, just let that sink in for a moment. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=56.86s)]
*  If a fetus is a person in the eyes of the law, then any miscarriage, which by the way [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=59.1s)]
*  is not uncommon, 10 to 20% of known pregnancies end in miscarriages, hundreds of thousands [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=63.620000000000005s)]
*  of cases. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=71.54s)]
*  If you live in the wrong state, any one of those can be treated as a potential homicide. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=72.54s)]
*  This is not theoretical. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=77.88s)]
*  Let's look at the case of Mallory Patrice Strait. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=79.52s)]
*  She's a Texas woman who was released from jail earlier this week after spending nearly [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=81.52s)]
*  five months in custody for miscarrying in a public bathroom. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=85.6s)]
*  She was arrested for corpse abuse and accused of trying to flush fetal remains down the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=91.28s)]
*  toilet. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=95.84s)]
*  Ultimately, the medical examiner found that she had, in fact, miscarried, that her fetus [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=96.84s)]
*  died in utero. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=101.44s)]
*  Prosecutors found no direct evidence that she tried to flush anything, so they dropped [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=103.19999999999999s)]
*  the charges. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=106.72s)]
*  What she experienced cannot be undone. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=108.19999999999999s)]
*  The compounded trauma of being criminalized after suffering something as emotionally and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=111.08s)]
*  physically taxing as a miscarriage, being dealt punishment when in fact she needed care. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=116.63999999999999s)]
*  In Ohio, Brittany Watts was also arrested on corpse abuse charges after she too had [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=123.55999999999999s)]
*  a miscarriage in a toilet. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=128.72s)]
*  Her charges were also subsequently dropped. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=131.18s)]
*  In Georgia, Selena Maria Chandler Scott had a miscarriage and was arrested for disposing [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=133.32s)]
*  of the fetal tissue. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=138.68s)]
*  Law enforcement accused her of concealing a death and abandoning a dead body, but just [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=140.48s)]
*  like the other cases, her charges were eventually dropped. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=144.04s)]
*  According to the advocacy group Pregnancy Justice, there were at least 210 pregnancy-related [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=148.51999999999998s)]
*  prosecutions in the year after Roe was overturned, the highest number ever to be documented in [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=154.24s)]
*  a single year. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=159.68s)]
*  It's important to note that low-income women and women of color were disproportionately [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=160.68s)]
*  targeted. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=164.72s)]
*  And this is only expected to get worse as more states are passing fetal personhood laws, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=166.20000000000002s)]
*  declaring that fertilized eggs have the same legal rights as people, even when they cannot [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=170.8s)]
*  survive outside the womb. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=175.12s)]
*  At least 24 states now include some form of personhood language in their anti-abortion [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=177.20000000000002s)]
*  laws. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=182.72s)]
*  Seventeen already have personhood laws on the books, and several other states are considering [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=183.72s)]
*  extreme expansions, including Florida, where at the University of Florida newspaper points [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=187.72s)]
*  out, quote, if state lawmakers have their way, a simple sip of wine or a single cigarette [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=192.32s)]
*  taken before a woman even knows she's pregnant could become a criminal offense. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=198.04s)]
*  Anything that a woman does that could potentially injure a fetus, whether that be accidental [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=202.4s)]
*  or intentional, could be deemed as child abuse and neglect according to the proposed fetal [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=206.28s)]
*  personhood bill, end quote. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=211.12s)]
*  Meanwhile, as the push to police and criminalize pregnant women intensifies, the Trump administration [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=213.92s)]
*  has been working to decriminalize activists who target abortion providers and their patients. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=219.92s)]
*  One of Trump's first presidential actions was to pardon nearly two dozen people who [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=226.32s)]
*  had been convicted of violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, known as [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=230.72s)]
*  FACE, the federal law that protects patients from violence, threats, and obstruction when [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=235.92s)]
*  seeking reproductive care. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=241.39999999999998s)]
*  Then the Justice Department announced that moving forward it would limit enforcement [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=243.44s)]
*  of the FACE Act, and MAGA Republicans are pushing legislation to repeal it altogether. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=246.76s)]
*  The FACE Act was passed 30 years ago with bipartisan support amid a wave of extremist [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=252.2s)]
*  violence against abortion providers, and today, according to the National Abortion Federation, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=256.48s)]
*  over the past two years there have been more than 700 incidents of obstruction, over 600 [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=261.8s)]
*  trespassing attempts, nearly 300 violent threats, and over 128,000 protests aimed at abortion [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=267.24s)]
*  providers across the country. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=273.24s)]
*  Those are just the cases we know about. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=275.64s)]
*  Joining me now, Michelle Goodwin, Professor of Constitutional Law and Global Health Policy [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=278.32s)]
*  at Georgetown Law. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=282.08s)]
*  She's the award-winning author of Policing the Womb, Invisible Women, and the Criminalization [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=283.2s)]
*  of Motherhood. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=287.36s)]
*  Also joining me is Caitlin Cash, a reproductive rights advocate and a plaintiff in Zyrowski [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=288.36s)]
*  v. State of Texas, which was filed in 2023 on behalf of women who were denied abortion [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=292.44s)]
*  care in the state of Texas. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=297.32s)]
*  Cash was also denied routine postpartum care because of Texas's abortion ban. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=298.92s)]
*  Welcome to both of you. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=304.0s)]
*  Thank you for being with us this morning. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=305.0s)]
*  Caitlin, Brittany Watts' pregnancy was deemed non-viable before she miscarried, but she [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=307.88s)]
*  couldn't get the care she needed because of Ohio's abortion laws, which led her to miscarry [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=313.84000000000003s)]
*  at home, which then led her to be arrested. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=318.56s)]
*  So it seems like many women now in a situation where they're being denied medical care are [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=321.84000000000003s)]
*  then criminalized when something goes wrong with the pregnancy, which is very common outside [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=326.4s)]
*  of the hospital. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=330.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=331.24s)]
*  I mean, you can't win. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=332.24s)]
*  In some of these states with these very restrictive bans, you can't win. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=336.0s)]
*  You are trying to take care of your miscarriage. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=340.15999999999997s)]
*  You're trying to go to your OB. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=342.68s)]
*  When I miscarried, I bled for five days at home. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=344.12s)]
*  I finally went to the OB, and we did a sonogram, found out that my baby no longer had a heartbeat. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=347.4s)]
*  She prescribed me medication. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=353.32s)]
*  I left, and I went to the pharmacy, and they wouldn't fill it. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=354.68s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=357.68s)]
*  They said they needed more information. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=358.68s)]
*  So I went home, and I mean, what if I had gone to a water burger? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=359.91999999999996s)]
*  You just can't win in these states, and it's horrific and terrifying, and people need to [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=364.76s)]
*  know what's happening in Texas because it is the blueprint for what is going to happen [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=369.88s)]
*  across the country. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=373.68s)]
*  And unfortunately, Michelle, you and I have talked about this before, but nearly half [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=375.12s)]
*  of the women who face charges associated with pregnancy loss were in Alabama. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=378.56s)]
*  Alabama is just one of several states with a fetal personhood law in place. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=383.6s)]
*  Tell me what's going on there. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=387.72s)]
*  It was the first place we went after the fall of Roe, because as Caitlin says, there are [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=388.72s)]
*  some states that are blueprints in what they're doing, and we were very worried that what [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=392.84s)]
*  goes on in Texas and Alabama was going to start to happen across the country. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=396.44s)]
*  That's right. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=400.04s)]
*  And even before Alabama actually had its personhood amendment made into law, there were prosecutors [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=401.92s)]
*  there. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=408.6s)]
*  The state's attorney general now, when he was a local prosecutor, was making efforts [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=409.6s)]
*  to criminally punish women who were perceived to have acted in a way that was contrary to [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=414.20000000000005s)]
*  perfection. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=421.0s)]
*  And that's one of the problems with these types of laws. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=422.20000000000005s)]
*  It holds women to a standard that is absolutely unrealistic. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=425.24s)]
*  What you mentioned early on is that miscarriage is natural. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=429.04s)]
*  Stillbirth is natural. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=432.8s)]
*  That's absolutely right. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=433.92s)]
*  That's not new. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=435.12s)]
*  That's not since Dobs. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=441.2s)]
*  That's not immediately post-Dobs. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=442.32s)]
*  That's millennia old. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=443.76s)]
*  And that's one of the problems here, is that there's a real divorce between health and [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=445.8s)]
*  science such that what's being criminally prosecuted right now is part of a natural [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=449.92s)]
*  life cycle, as natural as girls and women having menstrual cycles. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=454.76s)]
*  That's how natural miscarriage and stillbirth happen to be. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=459.76s)]
*  But in this era that seeks to weaponize all sorts of matters with regard to reproductive [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=462.76s)]
*  health, it means that anybody who becomes pregnant needs to look over her shoulder if [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=468.24s)]
*  she happens to travel into an anti-abortion state. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=474.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=478.03999999999996s)]
*  Caitlin, I see you nodding your head because that's exactly what's happening here. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=479.03999999999996s)]
*  It seems the concept of the idea, the word fetal personhood, does not convey the fact [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=481.56s)]
*  that you are now endangering all women. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=486.28s)]
*  Who potentially becomes pregnant now is a potential criminal in America. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=490.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=494.74s)]
*  I mean, being pregnant can be a death sentence, and now it can be a path to being criminalized. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=496.14s)]
*  It's horrific what's happening here. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=504.32s)]
*  And just yesterday, Texas, the legislative session ends in a week, on June 1st, and just [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=506.1s)]
*  yesterday they passed SB 2880 out of the House Committee. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=511.66s)]
*  This bill seeks to further that criminalization of women by increasing the bounty hunter law [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=515.02s)]
*  that we saw in SB 8, allowing that to happen with fees up to $100,000 for turning in your [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=520.04s)]
*  neighbor. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=526.18s)]
*  I mean, can you imagine being pregnant and you miscarry and something horrific happens [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=527.18s)]
*  and somebody says, oh, well, this is my chance to make a quick buck to prove my morality? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=531.78s)]
*  And they can win $100,000 for your pain and suffering. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=536.9399999999999s)]
*  And this bill just passed out of a House Committee yesterday. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=540.66s)]
*  It's going to be still a few days to try to fight it back in Texas. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=542.82s)]
*  I mean, this is happening, and the threats and attacks are just nonstop. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=545.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=548.9000000000001s)]
*  And the bounty hunting that Texas pioneered on this thing is only getting worse. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGU6MivPXQo&t=549.9000000000001s)]
