# The UK needed to ‘stroke Trump’s ego’ to get the best deal possible: Fmr. Trump official
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4)
*  Dimitri, you were talking about how much of a done deal this really is, this announcement [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=0.0s)]
*  of a trade deal with the U.K. The president acknowledging the details still have to be [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=4.24s)]
*  written up. And I would assume that Congress would have to sort of seal the deal, no? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=9.68s)]
*  That is the case. But Republicans in Congress have made it very clear that they are trying to [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=17.04s)]
*  really march to the music of President Trump and that they're going to follow his lead here. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=21.28s)]
*  I want to just touch on the Fed chair and what the president was just saying there, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=25.12s)]
*  because we know that the president has said that he's very frustrated with Fed chair Jerome Powell. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=28.48s)]
*  But he has also said to Kristen Welker in that exclusive, wide-ranging interview, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=32.96s)]
*  that he does not plan to fire Jerome Powell. And Jerome Powell has also said that he does not [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=37.04s)]
*  believe the president can fire him. And the courts have sort of backed that up, the idea that this [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=41.68s)]
*  is really an independent chair. So, yes, the president is complaining about him. But from our [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=46.08s)]
*  understanding, as of now, Fed chair Jerome Powell is going to continue to have his term until next [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=50.08s)]
*  year in 2026. And then he will likely, of course, be replaced. That being said, going back to the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=55.52s)]
*  trade deal that we're talking about right now, the president has been touting this as a big win. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=60.24s)]
*  It's interesting because this is the first, of course, big trade deal that he is announcing [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  since Liberation Day when he rolled out those unilateral letterals. I want to put up for people [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=68.88s)]
*  a bit of what the president said online. He said, together with our strong ally, the United Kingdom, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=73.36s)]
*  we have reached the first historic trade deal since Liberation Day. As part of this deal, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=77.60000000000001s)]
*  America will raise $6 billion in external revenue from 10 percent tariffs, $5 billion in new export [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=81.52s)]
*  opportunities for our great ranchers, farmers and producers, and enhance the national security [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=88.0s)]
*  of both the U.S. and U.K. through the creation of an aluminum steel trading zone and a secure [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=92.56s)]
*  pharmaceutical supply chain. This deal, he said, shows that if you respect America and bring serious [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=98.08s)]
*  proposals to the table, America is open for business. And he also posted this graphic showing [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=102.64s)]
*  $5 billion going up, $6 billion going up, also putting out what those trade tariffs are. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=107.92s)]
*  I also want to just note that the U.K. is also touting this. The U.K. prime minister put out a [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  press release calling this a quote landmark deal on the phone there in the Oval Office. The U.K. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=117.36s)]
*  prime minister was saying that this is going to create jobs, that there's going to be all sorts [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=122.48s)]
*  of benefits for the U.K. Brian walked us through sort of some of the different trade deals and [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=126.0s)]
*  details on the U.K. side. But I think what's interesting here is that we're now waiting to [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=131.04s)]
*  see what other deals come, especially when it comes to China with that meeting happening [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=134.88s)]
*  in Switzerland between the U.S. and Chinese officials. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=138.4s)]
*  And so, Gene, let me get your reaction here. You've been listening in this whole time, this [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=140.56s)]
*  announcement. Does it live up to the hype we just heard from the president, from [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=146.56s)]
*  Luttonic, even Starmer and the U.K. ambassador? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=151.44s)]
*  Well, you know, the answer to that is obviously not at all. I might have thought it was a trade [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=155.68s)]
*  deal on fertilizer because there was a bit of that in the press conference. But let's step back [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=163.36s)]
*  and just for a moment think about how much this stresses the incoherence of the Trump [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=170.4s)]
*  trade policy. What was the great global emergency? He said it was that we have trade [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=179.84s)]
*  deficits in goods with other countries. So his first deal is with the U.K. where we have a 12 [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=187.76000000000002s)]
*  to $14 billion trade surplus with them. So his first deal is with a country we have a trade [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=195.68s)]
*  surplus with. Also, it's a day after the U.K. just announced a deal with India, making very clear [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=205.04000000000002s)]
*  that you did not have to threaten the entire global economy to get this very marginal [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=213.92s)]
*  trade agreement. And I can't really let's focus on that. You have an economy that was a consensus [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=223.11999999999998s)]
*  soft landing, consensus, strong, steady growth and lower inflation. Now you have an economy [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=231.04s)]
*  where there is consensus, fears of recession and stagflation, all due completely to Trump's [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=238.16s)]
*  trade proposals. And so what do we get? We get something where he's telling us, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=245.76s)]
*  and I know this is comforting to hundreds of millions of American families, that you can be [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=251.76s)]
*  assured that Bentleys and Rolls Royces will come in at a lower tariff rate if you can buy one of [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=257.52s)]
*  the first 100,000. And he says, well, he gets that they have to be made in the U.K. So he doesn't [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=265.2s)]
*  want to raise prices on those luxury cars. But the clothes, the back to school clothes, the coffee, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=272.47999999999996s)]
*  the avocados, the things that American consumers are relying on that you depend on other countries [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=279.52s)]
*  to provide, he is more than happy to keep a tariff on them. So truly the incoherence of him [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=286.64s)]
*  really destroying the path of the U.S. economy over a goods trade deficit, doing [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=294.16s)]
*  a first agreement with a country we have a surplus with, and then making his headline deal about [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=300.32s)]
*  we're going to lower tariff on Bentleys and Rolls Royces. I mean, I think the only reason markets [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=307.76s)]
*  are up a little is not because this is a significant deal, but they think that if Trump will take this, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=314.56s)]
*  maybe this is how he does his off ramp. He just takes a lot of shallow PR deals. And so if people [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=321.28s)]
*  are happy about this, it's because they're hoping it shows that Trump will have a low bar for [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=329.03999999999996s)]
*  de-escalation, not that it's a significance. And remember today, last thing I'll say is you at the [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=335.03999999999996s)]
*  same time seeing the EU just offer the potential of 100 billion euros, it's great sanctions on us. So [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=341.11999999999995s)]
*  it's not to me a very reassuring day. Right. The EU threatening additional tariffs that would be [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=349.76s)]
*  retaliatory against the U.S. if they can't come to some kind of a deal. Sarah, let me get your [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=356.56s)]
*  reaction. You've been inside these rooms, your thoughts, or what was going through your mind as [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=361.28000000000003s)]
*  you heard all these officials around the president just lathering on the praise for him as the [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=366.72s)]
*  ultimate deal maker, including officials from the UK? Yeah. I mean, it sounds like this is a [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=372.8s)]
*  marginal deal and that it's not that big of a deal when we look at. I'm curious to see the [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=378.64s)]
*  details of how much there will be in change compared to what we previously had with the UK, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=384.08s)]
*  compared to what this deal will shape up to look like, since it sounds like they're still ironing [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=389.36s)]
*  out the details. But it didn't surprise me to hear the cabinet officials and some of the UK officials [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=393.52s)]
*  kind of praising Trump and boosting his ego a bit and stroking his ego, because that's what they know [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=399.91999999999996s)]
*  they need to do. For the cabinet officials, that's what they do to keep their jobs and keep him [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=405.28s)]
*  happy. And then the UK officials also know that in order to negotiate the best deal for their [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=410.32s)]
*  country, that they need to stroke his ego. And so that's kind of, I think, what we saw take place [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=415.2s)]
*  there. I will point out, too, that this is the first deal that we've seen the Trump administration [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=419.59999999999997s)]
*  negotiate. But it's ironic because in Trump's recent Time magazine interview, he said that he [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=424.88s)]
*  had already negotiated 200 deals with 200 countries. And obviously, we have yet to see the [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=430.56s)]
*  details of any of those trade deals. And then most importantly, we're waiting on what a deal with [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=436.0s)]
*  China will look like. And Trump says that he's talking with the Chinese. But I think that [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=440.88s)]
*  Americans are really upset with his handling of the economy right now. And as we get further into [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=445.36s)]
*  summer and empty shelves and skyrocketing prices continue, then Americans are only going to continue [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=450.08s)]
*  to be upset with him and his handling of the economy. And you're going to see him continue to [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=456.24s)]
*  shift the blame to folks like Jerome Powell because he doesn't want to take on that [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=460.24s)]
*  responsibility, even though it's his incoherence and his policies that he's putting forward that [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=464.96000000000004s)]
*  are responsible for it. He did answer some questions about China specifically. He said he [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=470.96000000000004s)]
*  wants to see China opened up. We know the Treasury secretary is going to be headed there along with [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=475.44s)]
*  the U.S. Trade Representative James Sinclair, who was also in that room and part of this announcement [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=480.08s)]
*  today. Everybody, thank you so much for joining us and being there to catch what came of this big [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=485.6s)]
*  announcement in the Oval Office, which is still ongoing. We'll continue to monitor that Q&A. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=491.36s)]
*  Appreciate you all. Thank you. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=496.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj_8DHw4y4&t=515.6s)]
