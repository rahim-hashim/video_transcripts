# ‘May be on track to be a 21st century Herbert Hoover’: Nicolle Wallace on risks of Trump's trade war
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo)
*  Today, when many of the stories we lead this program with on a daily basis are colliding [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=0.0s)]
*  in dramatic fashion today, thanks of course to Donald Trump and the wrecking ball. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=4.88s)]
*  He has taken to the United States reputation as a pillar of both the global economy and [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=11.52s)]
*  global security. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=16.8s)]
*  A crush of alarming economic headlines today. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=17.8s)]
*  The International Monetary Fund is warning of a global slowdown thanks to uncertainty [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=21.04s)]
*  Donald Trump's on again off again tariff regime. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=26.82s)]
*  Washington Post reports this quote, Trump's double barreled tariff plan, a 10% tax on [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=29.82s)]
*  nearly everything the US imports each year, plus significantly higher levies on goods [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=34.980000000000004s)]
*  from dozens of nations will hurt the United States and its trading partners, the fund [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=40.5s)]
*  said. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=45.54s)]
*  As we have reported in recent days and weeks, Trump fueled uncertainty has led to enormous [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=46.54s)]
*  volatility in the markets. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=51.620000000000005s)]
*  It is today that Treasury Secretary Scott Besson told investors that a trade war with [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=53.86s)]
*  China was unsustainable since stock soaring. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=58.34s)]
*  The Dow Jones up about 1000 points after markets plunged yesterday. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=62.42s)]
*  The overall picture for the markets remains cloudy though. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=67.02s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal is reporting today that the Dow Jones is on track for its worst [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=70.22s)]
*  April since the Great Depression. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=74.5s)]
*  Let that sink in since 1932. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=77.62s)]
*  As for Donald Trump, he may be on track to be more than just a 21st century Herbert Hoover. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=80.46s)]
*  Investors are worried that what Trump has set in motion is bigger than trade barriers. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=86.02s)]
*  They're worried that he is unraveling an economic order that has for decades taken American [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=90.82s)]
*  stability for granted. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=95.6s)]
*  The IMF's chief economist saying today quote, the global economic system that has operated [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=97.58s)]
*  for the past 80 years is being reset. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=102.82s)]
*  The US effective tariff rate has now surged past levels reached at the turn of the 20th [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=106.26s)]
*  century. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=111.34s)]
*  Beyond the tariffs themselves, the surge in policy uncertainty related to trade policy, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=112.34s)]
*  but also more broadly is a major driver of the economic outlook. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=117.58000000000001s)]
*  Behind that quote, surge in policy uncertainty, a phrase I'm going to steal, a Trump administration [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=122.18s)]
*  defined by its manmade instability. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=129.06s)]
*  New York Times reporter Luke Broadwater writes in The Times today that quote, the veneer [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=132.42s)]
*  of a more disciplined White House has begun to crack. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=136.58s)]
*  It's not just the uncertainty around Trump's imposing and then lifting tariffs that makes [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=140.5s)]
*  the Trump administration and by extension, our entire country look and feel unstable. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=145.26s)]
*  It's not just Defense Secretary Pete Hague says recklessness with military attack plans. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=151.06s)]
*  It's not just the war with the country's oldest and richest university, which reportedly [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=156.7s)]
*  began with a letter from the Trump administration that was sent by mistake. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=161.7s)]
*  It's not just Elon Musk's slashing and burning indiscriminately of government agencies or [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=165.98s)]
*  Donald Trump taking to social media to target the head of the Federal Reserve. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=171.82s)]
*  It's all of it. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=176.98s)]
*  All these developments that paint the picture of a country, of a United States that is increasingly [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=178.22s)]
*  in the eyes of investors, a bad bet. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=184.76s)]
*  Former Trump aide and investor Anthony Scaramucci told New York magazine this quote, I submit [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=188.95999999999998s)]
*  that irreparable damage has been done to the United States. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=193.39999999999998s)]
*  If you are a Western ally, you're looking at the United States and saying the body politic [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=197.44s)]
*  is damaged. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=202.39999999999998s)]
*  Now, it marks a dramatic change from even the first Trump administration. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=203.39999999999998s)]
*  Bulwark writes it this way, quote, during Trump's first term, his defenders frequently [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=208.67999999999998s)]
*  pretended that his tweets and ad hoc political approach simply did not matter in the real [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=212.78s)]
*  world. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=218.1s)]
*  It was a convenient fiction that markets largely indulged. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=219.1s)]
*  Trump's griping about Powell didn't crash markets then. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=223.33999999999997s)]
*  Now, however, Trump has cured investors of that cheerful nonchalance for his momentary [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=226.78s)]
*  grievance filled whims. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=232.17999999999998s)]
*  When he posts, the damage now appears in real time. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=234.22s)]
*  Trump is Trump. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=237.22s)]
*  It's too much to expect he'll ever learn his lesson about this or quench his desire to [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=238.42s)]
*  accumulate power. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=243.05999999999997s)]
*  But for the rest of us, it's a bracing reminder. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=244.98s)]
*  On the other side of all this, we do well to build the guardrails a little stronger [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=247.79999999999998s)]
*  and higher. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=251.94s)]
*  The U.S. economy in danger of becoming a victim of Donald Trump's autocratic and erratic ambitions [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=252.94s)]
*  is where we start today with CNBC senior economics reporter Steve Leifman, also joining us, staff [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=258.52s)]
*  writer for The Atlantic and co-author of the New York Times bestseller Abundance. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=264.14s)]
*  Derek Thompson is back also with us for the hour. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=268.9s)]
*  Former Congressman MSNBC political analyst David Jolly is here. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=271.74s)]
*  So Steve, as you're so expert at doing, widen the lens for us on today's headlines about [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=276.18s)]
*  what is increasingly the intersection between our economy and the world's economy and the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=284.34000000000003s)]
*  current administration. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=289.18s)]
*  Oh, you sighed. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=290.18s)]
*  Well, you only give me small tests. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=292.3s)]
*  But I do want to personally and publicly thank you for having me on on a day when the market [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=297.90000000000003s)]
*  was up so that viewers did not think that I was only this terrible harbinger of doom [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=302.74s)]
*  that only comes on when the market is down a thousand points. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=308.7s)]
*  Because it's always news. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=311.46000000000004s)]
*  Once in a while, anyway. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=312.46000000000004s)]
*  It's always a story, right? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=314.26s)]
*  It's a driver. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=318.14s)]
*  Let me tell you what would happen. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=319.97999999999996s)]
*  And I wish I had more expertise in this. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=321.34s)]
*  I've only read the transcript of what Scott Bessent told privately to a JP Morgan meeting [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=323.53999999999996s)]
*  three times to try to understand it. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=329.14s)]
*  But the market was up a little bit after that big sell off yesterday over that concern over [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=331.09999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump possibly or thinking about replacing the Fed chair, Jay Powell, even though most [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=337.58s)]
*  think he doesn't have the legal right to do that. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=343.14s)]
*  So it was up a little bit. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=346.06s)]
*  But then it really got a charge when Scott Bessent, the Treasury Secretary, said that [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=347.1s)]
*  this relationship as it is now is unsustainable. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=351.58s)]
*  That gave the market hope that there could be or would be some form of near term or closer [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=355.82s)]
*  progress in these negotiations. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=361.78000000000003s)]
*  And if you remember, that's what everybody is looking for is at least some progress. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=364.06s)]
*  Now, it's important what you said earlier, that progress means we only go back to these [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=368.86s)]
*  terrible 10 percent tariffs that are the source of the IMF marking down the U.S. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=374.06s)]
*  economy. It's why everybody thinks the Fed has to come in and cut interest rates. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=379.26s)]
*  And there's also a reason why we're going to have people think there's going to be a [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=383.06s)]
*  recession in the United States. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=386.34000000000003s)]
*  So it doesn't get a whole lot better, even if it gets better off of this terrible place [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=387.74s)]
*  we're in right now. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=392.9s)]
*  But there was this interesting line I want to point out, Nicole, because I've read it [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=394.06s)]
*  a bunch of times. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=397.58s)]
*  He said, now with China, we find there's this balance between economic and military that [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=398.7s)]
*  we've never seen before, which I raised my eyebrows about through the roof, because I [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=404.14s)]
*  remember you were still in the Bush administration just, I think, as you were leaving when Hank [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=409.82s)]
*  Paulson, the Treasury Secretary and the first president, launched the strategic and economic [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=416.09999999999997s)]
*  dialogue when they realized back in 2006 that the China relationship was much more [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=421.26s)]
*  complicated than just trade, that we had a whole bunch of things to deal with with them. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=427.7s)]
*  And it was not just a trade relationship. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=433.02s)]
*  Well, it may be a good thing, but it does appear as if the second Trump administration, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=435.06s)]
*  I don't know how many years later, is realizing that it's a very complicated relationship [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=440.46s)]
*  with China. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=444.38s)]
*  And it does not pay for the U.S. to focus only on trade. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=445.38s)]
*  When the two biggest economies, two major military powers in the world face off against [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=449.7s)]
*  each other, we should be talking on a whole lot of levels and not do what we've done right [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=454.86s)]
*  now, which is effectively an embargo on China. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=459.5s)]
*  What is the, and you'll always be here, whether the markets go up or down, because I think [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=463.7s)]
*  that what our politics have turned on is separate from the markets, right? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=468.86s)]
*  And our politics have turned on American families feeling like things are too expensive, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=472.98s)]
*  right? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=477.34000000000003s)]
*  And it's got a local layer. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=478.34000000000003s)]
*  Remember, someone ran for mayor of this great city on a the rent is too damn high message. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=479.34000000000003s)]
*  And Americans in large numbers voted for Donald Trump because of things like the price of [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=484.38s)]
*  eggs and housing. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=488.92s)]
*  What does the constant instability do for the economy and the decisions that business [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=490.98s)]
*  owners on main streets all across our country have to make? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=498.3s)]
*  It shuts it down. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=503.62s)]
*  I mean, look, one of the things that's so great about the U.S. economy is its dynamism, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=504.62s)]
*  this feeling you can invest in something, you can take a gamble, take a risk on something. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=510.18s)]
*  And the other, the foundation of that is the stability of economic regimes, of economic [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=515.14s)]
*  policy. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=521.58s)]
*  It can change. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=522.58s)]
*  I have argued, Nicole, for 20 something years that we give presidents too much credit and [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=523.58s)]
*  too much blame for the economy because I don't think they're that consequential. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=530.26s)]
*  That was until January 20th, 2025, when you could really draw direct lines in ways that [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=535.4200000000001s)]
*  have been very difficult to draw between the president's policies and stock market and [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=542.7s)]
*  economic outcomes. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=547.0600000000001s)]
*  So in general, they don't have that big of an influence. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=549.3s)]
*  But here the president has come along and really changed global trade flows, done a [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=552.9399999999999s)]
*  whole bunch of things to really cause investors and entrepreneurs to say, wait a second, we [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=557.9799999999999s)]
*  need to take a break here and see what the story is before I commit money. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=564.9s)]
*  Let me give you an example. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=568.6999999999999s)]
*  I talked to a manufacturer who said, hey, I benefit from these tariffs, but I am not [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=569.6999999999999s)]
*  going to sink a single pile of concrete in the ground because I cannot be sure that the [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=575.4599999999999s)]
*  benefit I think I'm going to get down the road is going to come back to me and I can [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=581.3399999999999s)]
*  rely upon it over time to make a long-term investment. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=585.54s)]
*  These things take years to pay back. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=589.5s)]
*  The other thing I think that's interesting, Nicole, is this whole trade issue began with [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=591.42s)]
*  several devastated communities economically from trade. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=596.6999999999999s)]
*  But when you think about what's happening with these tariffs, there is no guarantee [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=602.36s)]
*  that the factories, if they are ever constructed, go back to these communities. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=606.92s)]
*  So to the extent that they're trying to address this political economic question, which you're [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=611.64s)]
*  so interested in, I am not sure that a tariff of $300 or $600 billion on the entire American [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=616.48s)]
*  public is the most—in fact, I'm sure it is not the most efficient way to address that [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=624.42s)]
*  problem. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOsuIxyxlo&t=629.04s)]
