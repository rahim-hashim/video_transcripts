# ‘Simply going after people because of the way they look’: CA Rep. reacts to ICE raids
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k)
*  LA Mayor Karen Bass is blaming the president's ICE raids for the unrest happening in her [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=0.0s)]
*  city, telling MSNBC's Anna Cabrera until the raids stop, she'll be concerned about fear [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=4.88s)]
*  and tension in Los Angeles. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=10.64s)]
*  The White House instigated this by having ICE raids in our city. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=13.42s)]
*  They are telling us that they're going to have raids for the next 30 days. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=17.76s)]
*  So you know that that has a whole sector of the population on pins and needles. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  You are talking about someone doing childcare, a nanny in an individual's home, or your landscaper, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=26.28s)]
*  your gardener, you know, people who are small business owners, people who contribute to [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=32.32s)]
*  our economy in multiple ways. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=36.760000000000005s)]
*  And so to disrupt that hurts the economy of Los Angeles and is the opposite of what we [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=39.68s)]
*  need to be doing. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=45.16s)]
*  Joining us now is California Democratic Congresswoman Norma Torres. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=47.36s)]
*  Congresswoman, you just heard Mayor Bass say there are going to be raids for the next 30 [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=51.24s)]
*  days after that. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=55.36s)]
*  She said there were at least five conducted across LA on Monday. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=56.36s)]
*  Is there anything you can tell us about the tempo of ICE activity you're hearing about [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=59.92s)]
*  in and around your district? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=64.04s)]
*  And what's the reaction from constituents? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=65.68s)]
*  The reaction, Christina, from my constituents is one of complete scare. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  These are scare tactics. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  They are panicked. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  They are worried about their families. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=79.64s)]
*  They're worried about the children going to school. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=81.88s)]
*  They're worried about their spouses not coming home. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=85.68s)]
*  In many cases, people aren't reporting crimes that are occurring to them, whether they are [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=88.68s)]
*  witnesses or victims, because they are too afraid to engage with any law enforcement [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=94.52s)]
*  agency. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=101.08s)]
*  And this is the chaos that the president created when he sent an unchecked group of ICE officers, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=102.08s)]
*  to a community to profile and do these raids that they have not had a warrant. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=112.12s)]
*  They are not asking for specific names. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=123.28s)]
*  They are simply going after people because of the way they look. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  And this must stop. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=132.0s)]
*  The president must call back these ICE agents. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=133.32s)]
*  They must retreat in order for the locals to be given the opportunity to restore order [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=138.72s)]
*  because that is what we are demanding right now. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=145.32s)]
*  Congresswoman, I want to ask you, I'm just curious, as a lawmaker, as somebody who represents [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=148.23999999999998s)]
*  these areas, are you given any kind of warning before these raids? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=152.35999999999999s)]
*  After them, is there a database that you can go into to see how many have taken place? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=156.16s)]
*  Or are you trying to come up with this data just based on what people are seeing and hearing [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=159.67999999999998s)]
*  and reporting to you? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=164.2s)]
*  Yes, there is no forewarning to anyone. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=165.8s)]
*  And in some cases, in many cases, I should say, there hasn't even been a warning to the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=168.8s)]
*  local police departments. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=174.0s)]
*  And yet they are having to deploy backup officers in order to assist agents when they get into [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=176.4s)]
*  trouble. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=183.24s)]
*  You know, I want to be very clear about the fact that when they take people into custody, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=184.24s)]
*  they are supposed to put their names into a registry, a searchable database where family [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=192.16s)]
*  members can find their loved ones. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=199.32s)]
*  But what we are finding out is that they are not updating that database, and it is impossible [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=201.8s)]
*  to find people. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=209.24s)]
*  I'll give you an example of two of my constituents that were arrested in Anaheim. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=210.24s)]
*  They were taken to Santa Ana, and from there, we couldn't find them. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=216.72s)]
*  They were transferred out of there to downtown Los Angeles. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=223.72s)]
*  When the attorneys found them in downtown Los Angeles, they were transferred back to [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=228.88s)]
*  Santa Ana. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=233.16s)]
*  The only reason why I found out that they were there in Santa Ana again was because [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=234.16s)]
*  one of our colleagues was able to get access to that detention facility. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=238.92s)]
*  And we were talking and just matched the description that they were two painters that [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=245.64000000000001s)]
*  happened to be there when this colleague was doing a walk through through the facility. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=249.88s)]
*  This is unfortunate. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=257.12s)]
*  This should not be happening. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=258.12s)]
*  We demand a due process. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=260.12s)]
*  We demand ICE to come in with specific warrants. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=261.96000000000004s)]
*  They need to target specific people. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=265.32s)]
*  That is one thing. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=267.1s)]
*  But indiscriminately catching and going after people simply because of the color of their [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=268.2s)]
*  skin is not something that we can tolerate as a community. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=273.64s)]
*  I also want to get your reaction. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=277.8s)]
*  Speaker Mike Johnson is saying Democrats are on the wrong side of this issue. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=279.24s)]
*  If you can take a listen. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=282.59999999999997s)]
*  The Democrats are making a terrible political calculation. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=284.91999999999996s)]
*  They are on the side of lawbreakers. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=288.03999999999996s)]
*  They are on the side of illegal aliens. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=290.03999999999996s)]
*  They are on the side of, in some cases, MS-13 members and people who have abused their spouses. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=291.71999999999997s)]
*  I mean, they're on the wrong side of this. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=298.59999999999997s)]
*  The American people do not want violent criminals from other countries illegally in the U.S. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=300.44s)]
*  I mean, this is a very common sense position that we've taken. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=305.64s)]
*  Congresswoman, how do you respond to that? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=309.48s)]
*  This is the political theater in the picture that Republicans and the president are trying [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=313.76s)]
*  to paint. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=318.28s)]
*  We absolutely stand against having criminals here. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=319.4s)]
*  We absolutely support the deportation of violent criminals. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=323.52s)]
*  That was the promise of Donald Trump. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=328.26s)]
*  But that isn't what is happening. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=330.18s)]
*  They are storming school graduations. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=332.3s)]
*  They are trying to force their way into elementary schools to arrest children. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=335.42s)]
*  The fact that they are utilizing our military, the Marines should never be put on a political [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=342.65999999999997s)]
*  theater stage simply to score a point. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=350.38s)]
*  These are human beings that we're talking about, and law and order doesn't come at [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=355.14s)]
*  their discretion. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=361.58s)]
*  We either support law and order or we don't. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=363.38s)]
*  And we cannot be taking any side here except the side of humanity. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=366.62s)]
*  Congresswoman Nora Torres, thank you so much for being with us. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=371.18s)]
*  Thank you, Christina. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=375.34s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZRpweE87k&t=385.14s)]
