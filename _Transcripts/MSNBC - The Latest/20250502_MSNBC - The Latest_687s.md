# SCOTUS justice shreds Trump’s attacks on judges in stunning rebuke
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y)
*  We begin today with bracing warnings about Donald Trump's assault on constitutional limits [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=0.0s)]
*  and a sitting Supreme Court justice making a rare public statement about the impact on [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=5.5s)]
*  the judiciary. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=10.620000000000001s)]
*  Without directly naming Trump, Justice Katanji Brown Jackson appeared to denounce the administration's [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=12.5s)]
*  repeated attacks on judges. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=17.38s)]
*  As she put it to an audience of sitting federal judges and lawyers last night, Jackson said, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=19.900000000000002s)]
*  The attacks are not random. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=25.22s)]
*  They seem designed to intimidate those of us who serve in this critical capacity, and [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=27.66s)]
*  they ultimately risk undermining our Constitution and the rule of law. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=32.28s)]
*  I can report that I was at that event last night and the crowd was keenly focused on [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=37.84s)]
*  the justice's words. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=43.8s)]
*  Jackson had been slated to give brief remarks before settling into a longer conversation [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  with a sitting judge about her recent memoir. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=50.44s)]
*  She wound up speaking for a little over a quarter of an hour about the attacks on the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=53.18s)]
*  judiciary before pivoting to that conversation about her memoir. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=57.4s)]
*  At the end of the evening, the crowd gave Jackson a standing ovation. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=61.72s)]
*  On the same night that Justice Jackson made those comments, Donald Trump was in Alabama [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=66.76s)]
*  and he had this to say. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=71.36s)]
*  The courts are trying to stop me from doing the job that I was elected to do, but they [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=74.32s)]
*  have to let us do the job that the voters want us to do. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=78.6s)]
*  The judges are interfering, supposedly based on due process. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=82.52s)]
*  Meanwhile, this morning, Trump opened a new front on a different perceived enemy with [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=87.14s)]
*  a legally dubious threat to enlist the IRS in his crusade against Harvard University. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=93.34s)]
*  Trump vowed he will be, quote, taking away Harvard's tax-exempt status. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=99.66s)]
*  As the Times reports, quote, federal law prohibits the president from directing the IRS to conduct [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=104.72s)]
*  tax investigations. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=110.22s)]
*  At this hour, it is unclear if the IRS will follow Trump's directive. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=111.98s)]
*  Today, Harvard called that move, quote, unlawful. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=117.12s)]
*  But let's step back and think about the bigger picture. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=121.5s)]
*  This week, the New York Times reporting declared Donald Trump's, quote, assault on legal constraints [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=124.80000000000001s)]
*  as unlike anything the United States has experienced. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=130.78s)]
*  And legal experts from across the ideological spectrum denounced the president's increasingly [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=134.54s)]
*  authoritarian tactics, including using the power of the presidency to attack perceived [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=139.52s)]
*  enemies. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=144.74s)]
*  To discuss all of this, joining me now is Professor Deborah Archer, a CLU president [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=146.24s)]
*  and a law professor at New York University. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=150.76000000000002s)]
*  Deborah is also the author of a brand new book, Dividing Lines, How Transportation Infrastructure [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=153.56s)]
*  Reinforces Racial Inequality. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=158.68s)]
*  Also at the table with us is Molly Jongfast, special correspondent with Vanity Fair and [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=161.44s)]
*  an MSNBC political contributor. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=166.28s)]
*  Deborah, let's start off with Justice Jackson's remarks last night. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=168.92s)]
*  How unusual is it to have a sitting member of the court speak so frankly about the state [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=174.04s)]
*  of the judiciary and the interaction between the administration and the judiciary? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=179.8s)]
*  It is unusual. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=184.8s)]
*  We've seen it a couple of times recently with this administration. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=185.8s)]
*  What I think she did was really important to use her platform to speak to something [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=189.78s)]
*  that we've been seeing and documenting. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=194.72s)]
*  And that is this administration taking steps to bring the legal system underneath the president's [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=197.32s)]
*  thumb. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=203.27999999999997s)]
*  And that undermines the ability to hold him to account, to protect the rule of law. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=204.64s)]
*  And we're seeing him do that by challenging the integrity of folks on both sides of the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=209.04s)]
*  bench. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=214.56s)]
*  So he has challenged law firms who have brought cases that he doesn't agree with, nonprofits. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=215.56s)]
*  And he has called out justices and judges by name. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=220.95999999999998s)]
*  So Deborah recently alluded to the idea that other judges have talked about this, Molly. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=224.32s)]
*  We know that Chief Justice John Roberts issued a very brief statement a few weeks ago. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=230.12s)]
*  This I think was a little bit more elaborate in terms of the statement. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=234.32s)]
*  She referenced Alexander Hamilton's quote that if we lose an independent judiciary, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=238.32s)]
*  then we've lost the Constitution. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=242.88s)]
*  How important, Molly, was it for her to say this? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=245.28s)]
*  And does it resonate more than the Chief Justice's very brief statement from a few weeks ago? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=248.44s)]
*  Well, I think all of what the Supreme Court is doing is resonating. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=253.12s)]
*  And we see this because Donald Trump talked about due process, right? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=257.8s)]
*  And that due process decision was a 9-0. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=261.32s)]
*  And I think that there have been a couple decisions around this, but there was one that [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=264.12s)]
*  was a—actually, I think there were two that were 9-0. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=268.03999999999996s)]
*  So that has clearly—he's sort of seen that. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=270.71999999999997s)]
*  He understands that. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=274.68s)]
*  And I think it's important to remember he sees polling. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=275.68s)]
*  He knows what's happening. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=278.44s)]
*  He knows what he's doing is not popular. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=279.68s)]
*  And I think the people who we've seen stand up, we've seen Jackson stand up, and we've [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=282.12s)]
*  also seen Harris, too, both say that these are the guardrails. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=286.47999999999996s)]
*  We need them. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=291.35999999999996s)]
*  Yet again, we're seeing black women stand up and say what no one else is sort of brave [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=292.35999999999996s)]
*  enough to say, which is that we are at a very perilous moment in American democracy. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=298.12s)]
*  And I think that is what she's saying. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=303.46s)]
*  And she's saying it because she sees how perilous this is. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=305.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=308.08s)]
*  So in addition to Katanji Brown Jackson, the chief justice, and Kamala Harris, we also [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=309.08s)]
*  heard something from retired Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, who said, quote, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=312.91999999999996s)]
*  It's quite possible that high-ranking officials in the Trump administration, including Marco [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=317.71999999999997s)]
*  Rubio, Kristi Noem, and Pam Bondi, might be held in criminal contempt because of their [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=322.52s)]
*  refusal to comply with court orders on the deportation issue. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=327.52s)]
*  Deborah, is this likely—what are the different constraints here in terms of having the court [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=332.24s)]
*  hold the administration accountable through contempt proceedings? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=338.08000000000004s)]
*  There are lots of ways to hold the administrative accountable, and that is one of them. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=341.16s)]
*  It's something that normally would be done by the Department of Justice, but under this [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=345.24s)]
*  administration— [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=348.84000000000003s)]
*  Unlikely. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=349.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, where the president has exercised complete control to direct the Department of Justice. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=350.84000000000003s)]
*  It's unlikely that's going to happen. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=355.44s)]
*  But a court could appoint an independent attorney to act in that role. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=357.20000000000005s)]
*  But still, the president has powers that might allow him to get around that as well. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=361.32000000000005s)]
*  He could pardon the members of his administration. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=365.52s)]
*  But it is important to remember that there still are checks and balances on folks within [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=369.0s)]
*  his administration. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=373.15999999999997s)]
*  So, Deborah raises a good point. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=374.15999999999997s)]
*  This can obviously be checked by the administration in various ways. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=376.47999999999996s)]
*  The DOJ can refuse to go forward with any efforts on criminal contempt proceedings. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=379.96s)]
*  The president might be able to pardon someone who is criminally convicted of contempt. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=385.08s)]
*  What about other kinds of constraints, whether it is the court of public opinion, maybe Congress [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=389.52s)]
*  gets off the couch at some point? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=395.32s)]
*  Molly, what are the other avenues here to hold this administration accountable, especially [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=397.2s)]
*  in light of what we've seen over the last week in terms of the president's dismal polling [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=401.48s)]
*  numbers? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=405.56s)]
*  So, what we historically thought was from Trump 1.0 was that in Trump's first administration, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=406.56s)]
*  when he crashed the markets, which he did, there was a pushback, and he was like, I don't [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=411.32s)]
*  want to lose my friend's money. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=416.6s)]
*  Right? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=418.0s)]
*  He had this immediate sort of reaction. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=419.0s)]
*  This time, he has not had the same kind of reaction. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=422.40000000000003s)]
*  But with the bond markets, when he saw the bond markets were really freaking out, when [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=424.72s)]
*  he saw that he was enacting something that could end up being a dollar flight, which [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=428.88s)]
*  would make all of our debt more expensive and would change really the way we live in [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=434.28000000000003s)]
*  many meaningful ways, I think when he saw that, he understood it, and that was a guardrail. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=439.18s)]
*  So I would say there are maybe three, right? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=444.8s)]
*  The judiciary, the bond market, and what is left of the free press. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=447.56s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=452.4s)]
*  So, money talks seems to be a theme here. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=453.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=455.4s)]
*  Molly, let's pivot to the story about Harvard. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=456.4s)]
*  I want to run some tape from a debate that broke out last night on—actually, today [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=459.48s)]
*  on CNBC. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=464.64s)]
*  So, take a listen. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=465.64s)]
*  Why are we doing this? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=466.64s)]
*  Because maybe it could put enough leverage to get him to vol—so many other universities [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=467.64s)]
*  voluntarily complied. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=472.9s)]
*  Harvard's fighting— Voluntarily? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=474.9s)]
*  I mean, this is a shakedown. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=475.9s)]
*  Whatever you want to call it. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=477.92s)]
*  Let's not say it's—nothing has been voluntary. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=478.92s)]
*  It's like the whole thing is a shakedown. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=481.08s)]
*  Could be. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=483.76s)]
*  The ends justify the means. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=484.76s)]
*  The ends justify the means. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=486.52s)]
*  No, the tolerance on universities. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=487.52s)]
*  The ends do not justify the means. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=488.52s)]
*  It is impossible. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=490.36s)]
*  At some level, you have to believe democracy is about a process. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=491.36s)]
*  It is. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=495.64s)]
*  Molly, that was Aaron Ross Sorkin saying democracy is about a process. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=496.64s)]
*  In what way can we extrapolate this from Harvard? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=504.0s)]
*  Is this really about a single university, or is there something larger here? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=506.64s)]
*  Is Aaron Ross Sorkin right that democracy itself is on the line? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=510.5s)]
*  Oh, 100 percent. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=513.84s)]
*  First of all, this administration is using anti-Semitism as a cloak, right? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=514.84s)]
*  This is not about anti-Semitism. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=520.16s)]
*  If they want to fight anti-Semitism, there are a lot of things they can do, and that [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=521.16s)]
*  would be great. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=526.1999999999999s)]
*  And nobody wants anti-Semitism. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=527.1999999999999s)]
*  It's bad. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=528.1999999999999s)]
*  I'm Jewish. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=529.1999999999999s)]
*  We don't like it. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=530.1999999999999s)]
*  It's terrible. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=531.2s)]
*  That said, that's not what this is about. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=532.2s)]
*  And we all know. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=534.2s)]
*  This is about Harvard bending the knee. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=535.24s)]
*  This is about Harvard becoming a captured institution the way Columbia has. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=537.08s)]
*  And what Harvard has smartly realized is that the courts will protect them in a way that [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=541.48s)]
*  Trump won't. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=547.28s)]
*  When you're a captured institution the way Columbia is, you are at the mercy of Donald [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=548.44s)]
*  Trump. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=552.84s)]
*  And we see this with the law firms that have given up. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=553.84s)]
*  Trump can change his mind at any time. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=556.88s)]
*  In many ways, Harvard is better off because they have the law. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=559.44s)]
*  And I think that's a really important point. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=564.06s)]
*  And 100 percent, this is not about anti-Semitism. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=565.78s)]
*  This is about capturing institutions. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=568.3399999999999s)]
*  It's about making sure that they don't express, do the science, do the things that Donald [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=570.8599999999999s)]
*  Trump doesn't like. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=576.54s)]
*  What's your take on this, Deborah, as someone within a university, the threat to revoke [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=577.54s)]
*  Harvard's tax-exempt status? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=582.8599999999999s)]
*  Why Harvard? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=585.0999999999999s)]
*  Why this moment? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=586.0999999999999s)]
*  I agree with what Molly has said. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=587.0999999999999s)]
*  This is about democracy. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=588.38s)]
*  It is about an attack on all of the institutions that form a free society. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=589.82s)]
*  It is because he disagrees with things that Harvard's teaching. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=594.46s)]
*  These are engines of dissent. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=598.3s)]
*  And he's trying to shut them down. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=599.3s)]
*  And trying to shut them down, trying to shut down education that he doesn't agree with, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=600.98s)]
*  that he may find distasteful. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=605.02s)]
*  And it violates the First Amendment. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=606.7s)]
*  Harvard has First Amendment rights. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=608.54s)]
*  The students there have First Amendment rights. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=609.86s)]
*  And it's a violation of those rights. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=611.42s)]
*  So Molly, the Supreme Court rebukes are rare. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=613.54s)]
*  The stronger resistance from the university may be rarer still. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=617.86s)]
*  What do you see going forward? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=620.7s)]
*  Are more people going to stand up to this administration? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=621.98s)]
*  Yes, I think they absolutely are. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=624.3000000000001s)]
*  And I think Harvard, it was so important that they did it. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=626.0600000000001s)]
*  And the way they did it was perfect. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=628.98s)]
*  And you know they were advised by Steven Levitsky, who is an expert in authoritarianism. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=630.5s)]
*  I mean, they just did this exactly right. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=635.74s)]
*  And we've seen other universities join them. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=637.9000000000001s)]
*  We've seen Michael Roth from Wesleyan, who has been just a leader at this. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=639.86s)]
*  And look, this is a moment when we have to be brave. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=645.5s)]
*  But the good news is the law is on our side, and the public polling is on our side, right? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=647.58s)]
*  You know, there were polls last week. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=653.38s)]
*  Donald Trump, the word that people used was chaotic, and that he had taken too much power. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HrApU9QB_Y&t=655.62s)]
