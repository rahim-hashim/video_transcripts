# ‘Test of the power of the judiciary’: Supreme Court hears arguments on birthright citizenship case
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk)
*  An enormously consequential question was before the nation's highest court today, whether [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=0.0s)]
*  the judiciary has the power to halt in its tracks broad and sweeping Trump administration [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=6.12s)]
*  policies. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=11.8s)]
*  The Supreme Court today hearing arguments on Donald Trump's efforts to end birthright [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=12.8s)]
*  citizenship, which is currently blocked by a nationwide injunction from a judge. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=16.6s)]
*  But what was at stake today was not the merits of the executive order overturning birthright [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=22.2s)]
*  citizenship, which goes against more than 100 years of legal precedent. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=27.040000000000003s)]
*  But instead, it was about whether individual judges have the power to block policies from [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=31.360000000000003s)]
*  going into effect nationwide. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=36.68s)]
*  On behalf of the Trump administration, Solicitor General John Sauer, who famously argued last [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=38.800000000000004s)]
*  year that a president could order SEAL Team Six to assassinate a rival, faced skeptical [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=44.2s)]
*  questioning from even some of the justices on the conservative majority. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=49.52s)]
*  But here's how Justice Sonia Sotomayor describes what Team Trump is asking for. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=54.36s)]
*  So when a new president orders that because there's so much gun violence going on in the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  country and he comes in and he says, I have the right to take away the guns from [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=67.12s)]
*  everyone. Then people and he sends out the military to seize everyone's guns. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=73.96s)]
*  We and the courts have to sit back and wait until every named plaintiff gets or every [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=82.44s)]
*  plaintiff whose gun is taken comes into court. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=91.52000000000001s)]
*  So as far as I see it, this order violates four Supreme Court precedents. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=94.48s)]
*  And you are and you are claiming that not just the Supreme Court, that both the Supreme [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=101.92s)]
*  Court and no lower court can stop an executive from universally. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=110.48s)]
*  From violating that holding, those holdings by this court. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=119.16s)]
*  The Supreme Court here has the power to rule on one of the most powerful tools that has [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  been deployed by the opposition to Donald Trump and his agenda. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=130.28s)]
*  And they found that in the courts, according to the Washington Post, there are at least [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=134.16s)]
*  thirty nine nationwide injunctions against the Trump administration policies right now, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=137.28s)]
*  including on federal funding for states, cuts to medical research and refugee admissions. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=141.96s)]
*  There was an injunction against Trump's transgender military ban, but that was lifted by [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=147.52s)]
*  the Supreme Court. And it's worth noting during the last administration, current Trump [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=152.56s)]
*  officials like Stephen Miller pushed for and in some cases, one nationwide injunctions [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=157.08s)]
*  against Biden policies, including on covid-19 vaccine mandates. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=162.36s)]
*  Trump even celebrated some of these rulings today during arguments. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=166.52s)]
*  Justice Jackson accused the Trump administration of trying to make it incredibly difficult [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=171.0s)]
*  to be challenged in court. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=176.16s)]
*  Your argument seems to turn our justice system, in my view, at least, into a catch me if [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=179.04s)]
*  you can kind of regime regime from the standpoint of the executive, where everybody has [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=185.04s)]
*  to have a lawyer and file a lawsuit in order for the government to stop violating people's [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=190.92000000000002s)]
*  rights. Justice Kagan says, let's assume for the purpose of this, that you're wrong [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=196.12s)]
*  about the merits, that the government is not allowed to do this under the Constitution. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=201.68s)]
*  And yet it seems to me that your argument says we get to keep on doing it until everyone [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=206.32s)]
*  who is potentially harmed by it figures out how to file a lawsuit, hire a lawyer, etc. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=211.56s)]
*  And I don't understand how that is remotely consistent with the rule of law. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=219.6s)]
*  The merits of the case at hand, the issue of Trump's order seeking to end birthright [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=226.88s)]
*  citizenship did come up at times today. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=231.0s)]
*  One of the plaintiffs, New Jersey Solicitor General Jeremy Feiglbaum, warned that without [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=233.68s)]
*  a nationwide injunction, a person's citizenship status would change depending on the state [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=238.56s)]
*  they were in. Listen to that. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=244.04000000000002s)]
*  And that's our submission here, that to accept what the United States wants as against our [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=246.84s)]
*  injunction and to say that it turns on or off when you cross state lines doesn't just harm [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=250.68s)]
*  the administration of our benefits, doesn't just even harm enrollment in our benefits, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=254.72s)]
*  also puts chaos on the ground where people's citizenship turns on and off when you cross [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=258.56s)]
*  state lines. If ICE has initiated a removal proceeding when you live in Philly and you [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=262.84s)]
*  move to Camden, I suppose the ICE removal is supposed to turn off at that point, potentially, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=267.04s)]
*  because your citizenship status has changed. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=271.8s)]
*  A case about a constitutionally guaranteed right turning into an even broader test about [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=274.96s)]
*  the power of the judiciary in America today is where we start. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=279.44s)]
*  With me at the table, former top official to the Department of Justice, MSNBC legal [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  analyst Andrew Weissman is here, plus NYU law professor, MSNBC legal analyst Melissa [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=287.48s)]
*  Murray is here. She clerks for Justice Sonia Sotomayor while serving at the U.S. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=292.48s)]
*  Court of Appeals. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=296.92s)]
*  Melissa, I start with you and Justice Sonia Sotomayor's really powerful example there [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=298.08s)]
*  about guns, something that you don't have to be a lawyer to understand and you don't have to be [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=305.68s)]
*  a Democrat or Republican to understand, but certainly not what the Trump administration [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=310.84000000000003s)]
*  thinks it wants. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=315.24s)]
*  This is a really important point. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=316.84000000000003s)]
*  It was one that was echoed by Kelsey Corcoran, who argued for the individual plaintiffs, and [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=317.96000000000004s)]
*  they kept bringing up the fact that the Chamber of Commerce does this. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=321.56s)]
*  What if the NRA does this? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=324.56s)]
*  Like, there are going to be times when you are going to have the shoe on the other foot and [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=325.76000000000005s)]
*  you're going to want a nationwide injunction to stop a policy that you find abhorrent Trump [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=330.04s)]
*  administration. And this is a problem on both sides. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=333.84000000000003s)]
*  And they made that clear. But it is often the most efficient way of addressing an [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=337.4s)]
*  unconstitutional or invalid law in a way that is expeditious, that makes sure that [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=342.12s)]
*  everyone's rights are protected without having to litigate those things in each individual [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=347.56s)]
*  jurisdiction across the country. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=352.15999999999997s)]
*  And I thought it was really meaningful that Justice Sotomayor and Justice Jackson, both of [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=353.96s)]
*  whom are the only members of the court to have served as district court judges, the judges who [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=358.23999999999995s)]
*  are issuing these nationwide injunctions are saying that we know what it's like on the [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=362.16s)]
*  front lines. No one's playing fast and loose here. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=366.92s)]
*  We're simply trying to do our level best to ensure justice for everyone. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=369.44s)]
*  And without this nationwide injunction, the administration basically gets to play whack-a-mole. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=374.68s)]
*  And we're just following you all across the country, trying to enjoy your patently [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=379.20000000000005s)]
*  unconstitutional policy. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=383.8s)]
*  What do you sort of say to make it clear that this wasn't just about birthright citizenship? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=385.96s)]
*  It really wasn't about birthright citizenship. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=393.35999999999996s)]
*  It was about whether a judge is ruling if Trump doesn't like it actually applies. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=395.2s)]
*  I mean, just explain what this was. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=401.56s)]
*  So this is such a good example for people to try and understand how procedure affects [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=403.67999999999995s)]
*  substantive rights. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=411.08s)]
*  And that's why everyone kept on saying, let's assume that whatever is a substance is unconstitutional [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=412.8s)]
*  here. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=418.68s)]
*  Birthright citizenship, the Sotomayor example was about guns. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=419.68s)]
*  And the question is, how do you get people to be able to vindicate that so that their [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=423.52s)]
*  rights aren't violated? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=428.68s)]
*  And that is where the sort of whack-a-mole idea or catch me if you can is so much at [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=430.88s)]
*  stake because the court could say you have to bring individual cases all around the country. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=436.96s)]
*  And that means each person has to do that. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=444.56s)]
*  And so rights can be violated against all sorts of people. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=447.12s)]
*  And only if you happen to have a lawyer and you happen to get there to court in time. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=451.44s)]
*  This is not hypothetical. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=456.62s)]
*  And here's the thing I'd say for people are saying, let me give me a concrete example. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=458.02s)]
*  We are seeing it in the immigration front every single day. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=462.88s)]
*  The Supreme Court said that you have to bring this by habeas. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=467.68s)]
*  Some people are like, I don't know what that is. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=472.08s)]
*  What does it mean? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=473.84s)]
*  It means you have to bring these individual cases. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=474.84s)]
*  And what does what is happening? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=477.6s)]
*  You have a patchwork of decisions. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=479.36s)]
*  You have people having to race around the country. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=481.44s)]
*  And what is the government doing? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=483.92s)]
*  They are literally playing whack-a-mole. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=485.34s)]
*  They're playing a shell game with people's lives. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=487.44s)]
*  They move people around to jurisdictions where there's not yet a court case that says [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=489.96s)]
*  you can't do this. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=495.2s)]
*  So they can export people or really extract them from this country. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=496.52s)]
*  So we're seeing that confluence of procedure affect people's substantive rights. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=500.0s)]
*  And that's really being what's at the heart of what's happening here today, but in a different [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=506.94s)]
*  context of birthright citizenship. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=512.0s)]
*  What did you hear from the justices that signals anything to you about how they felt about [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=514.48s)]
*  the arguments they heard? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=519.72s)]
*  So let me just add one more thing to what Andrew just said. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=521.36s)]
*  It's not simply that you have to argue these on an individualized basis in every single [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=524.68s)]
*  jurisdiction where it might arise. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=528.64s)]
*  They are doing this at a time when the Trump administration is also limiting the supply [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=530.68s)]
*  of available legal resources to litigate these cases. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=535.34s)]
*  So the law firms are not taking immigration cases pro bono anymore in the way that they [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=538.36s)]
*  used to. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=542.64s)]
*  Legal aid organizations are completely strapped. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=543.8s)]
*  All of this is by design to shut down every avenue of dissent in the judiciary for the [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=546.52s)]
*  administration's policies, like to allow them an open lane. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=552.52s)]
*  And so this is huge in terms of the procedure and the substance coming together. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=555.96s)]
*  I counted here the liberal justices clearly in favor of allowing the nationwide injunction [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=560.12s)]
*  to stand. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=566.28s)]
*  Maybe Justice Kagan was interested in some limiting principle where we might like whittle [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=567.36s)]
*  down how broad these nationwide injunctions might be. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=571.68s)]
*  But they were clearly there. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=574.28s)]
*  I think Justice Barrett was also with them. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=575.4s)]
*  I thought it was interesting that she is a mother of children who are not born in this [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=577.52s)]
*  country, but were adopted and naturalized here. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=582.1999999999999s)]
*  And make of that what you will. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=584.88s)]
*  I think the real question is who is going to join those four. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=587.3199999999999s)]
*  And I think the only lane I saw really open were Justice Gorsuch and maybe the chief [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=590.6s)]
*  justice. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=596.1999999999999s)]
*  Totally agree. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=597.52s)]
*  One of the more shocking things were Justice Kavanaugh and Justice Alito. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=599.6800000000001s)]
*  Justice Kavanaugh spent a lot of time trying to normalize what is happening today in this [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=606.6800000000001s)]
*  country. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=613.2s)]
*  And he said, oh, isn't it fair and tried to get concessions from the people challenging [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=614.2s)]
*  birthright citizenship, which as Sonia said, Mayor said, seems to violate four. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=621.1600000000001s)]
*  Four. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=626.76s)]
*  Not one. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=627.76s)]
*  Four Supreme Court presidents. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=629.56s)]
*  And he said, oh, this is just a president who wants to act quickly. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=630.56s)]
*  That's normal. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=634.88s)]
*  That's good faith. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=635.88s)]
*  I mean, it was so apologetic. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=636.88s)]
*  And then from Justice Alito, he basically said, we can't trust the system. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=640.2s)]
*  We can't trust district courts. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=645.0s)]
*  We can't trust courts of appeals. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=646.68s)]
*  It was a redux of the presidential immunity decision, which is we can't trust the Department [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=648.48s)]
*  of Justice and grand juries and trial juries. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=653.28s)]
*  So the reason we have to get rid of this is because you can only trust me, but not [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=656.28s)]
*  any of these lower courts because they're really doing this sort of crazy stuff. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=660.76s)]
*  It was, I mean, it was a continuation of the don't trust institutions, trust me. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=664.8399999999999s)]
*  I found those two justices deeply disturbing in their questioning. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTP0UHwpuNk&t=670.8s)]
