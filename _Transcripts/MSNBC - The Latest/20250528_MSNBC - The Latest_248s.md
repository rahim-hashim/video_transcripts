# Stakes are 'tremendous' for democracy: Harvard professor says Trump acting as an 'authoritarian'
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs)
*  And joining us now, Ryan Enos, professor of government and director of the Center for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=0.0s)]
*  American Political Studies at Harvard University. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=4.96s)]
*  Professor, thank you for being with us tomorrow. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=7.76s)]
*  A judge is going to revisit her hold on Trump's move to ban Harvard from enrolling international [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=10.32s)]
*  students. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  What do you see as the stakes here? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=16.12s)]
*  The stakes are tremendous, not just for Harvard, but I should emphasize more largely for American [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=18.7s)]
*  democracy. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  And I think that's a way we should be talking about this. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  People often act like this is a fight between Harvard and Trump, but it's not. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=27.92s)]
*  This is an example of a president acting as an authoritarian and essentially trying to [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=32.82s)]
*  take control of a private institution in the United States because he doesn't like their [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=37.92s)]
*  political speech. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=42.72s)]
*  And if that's allowed to go forward, then that'd be a tremendous break with the American [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=43.72s)]
*  tradition of democracy and how it relates to higher education. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=48.5s)]
*  You have been critical of how Harvard has handled the president's attacks, including [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=52.24s)]
*  its pledge to engage with a federal anti-Semitism task force in the wake of funding threats. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=56.76s)]
*  You wrote an op-ed in the Harvard Crimson back in April saying, quote, at a moment when [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  we desperately need civil society's leaders to stand up to authoritarianism, Harvard's [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=65.52s)]
*  administration has opted to stand down. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=70.44s)]
*  Again, that was in April. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=73.4s)]
*  A lot has happened since then. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=74.64s)]
*  How do you think Harvard is handling things now? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=76.2s)]
*  I think Harvard is absolutely doing the right thing by standing up to these attacks, and [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=79.44s)]
*  I'm glad they came around to see that. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=83.47999999999999s)]
*  And I think what we've seen from Harvard is that in many ways it's serving as a model [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=85.28s)]
*  for civil society, and that is something that people at Harvard can be very proud of. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=89.8s)]
*  But I think that all of America can rally around, because what we see here, as I mentioned [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=95.2s)]
*  earlier, is not just an attack on Harvard, but an example of an attack on civil institutions [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=100.68s)]
*  in the United States in the same way that Donald Trump attacked the press and has attacked [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=106.26s)]
*  law firms and has attacked other things that he thinks stands in his way. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=110.16s)]
*  And so at the time, we were urging Harvard to stand up and to push back, and that's exactly [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=114.26s)]
*  what Harvard has done now. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=119.94s)]
*  And I think it's been a great credit to the institution, but also what American civil [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=121.86s)]
*  society needed. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=125.53999999999999s)]
*  So Harvard's standing up, but the administration isn't backing down. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=127.0s)]
*  In fact, they keep upping the ante, upping the punishment, now seeking to end all of [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=131.5s)]
*  Harvard's federal contracts, totaling an estimated $100 million. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=136.74s)]
*  And that includes funding for research and graduate student services. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=140.42s)]
*  What's the impact of this? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=145.38s)]
*  Well, the impact is tremendous. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=147.17999999999998s)]
*  It is already frozen research, research on things that are there to help the American [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=151.01999999999998s)]
*  people, like research for deadly diseases, research to make our defense stronger, our [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=155.85999999999999s)]
*  military stronger, teaching that educates the next generation of leaders in the United [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=160.94s)]
*  States. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=166.85999999999999s)]
*  And the way I think people have to understand this is we think that this is something that's [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=168.26s)]
*  attacking Harvard. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=171.78s)]
*  But Harvard will be all right. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=172.78s)]
*  I mean, Harvard is an old rich institution, and people shouldn't shed a tear for it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=174.82s)]
*  What they should think about is the fact that Donald Trump is canceling money that was allocated [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=179.57999999999998s)]
*  to Harvard by law in order to further the interests of the American people, because [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=185.45999999999998s)]
*  experts determined that Harvard was the best place to do this research on necessary, on [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=190.62s)]
*  things that were necessary for America, things like this drug research, things like this [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=197.42000000000002s)]
*  medical research. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=201.74s)]
*  And Donald Trump, for arbitrary political reasons, has essentially stopped that. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=203.34s)]
*  And he's not hurting Harvard. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=207.86s)]
*  It's not good for us. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=209.42000000000002s)]
*  We don't like it. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=210.42000000000002s)]
*  But ultimately, he's hurting the American people. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=211.42000000000002s)]
*  Very quickly, if you will, do you expect Harvard to win this battle? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=213.1s)]
*  In the long run, yes, I think they will. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=217.46s)]
*  I mean, I think America is behind us and it's going to be painful, but Americans believe [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=219.1s)]
*  in democracy. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=222.9s)]
*  And that's what this battle is about. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=223.9s)]
*  Ryan Enos, thank you so much for being with us. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDZ_tUvRLs&t=225.46s)]
