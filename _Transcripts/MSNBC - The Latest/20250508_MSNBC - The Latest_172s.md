# White smoke emerges from the Sistine Chapel chimney as new pope is selected
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojgCkcwhyJ0)
*  Do we hear the bells ringing? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojgCkcwhyJ0&t=0.0s)]
*  One of the things that has happened is that because it was difficult to tell white smoke [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojgCkcwhyJ0&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  from black smoke, they instituted the ringing of the bells. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojgCkcwhyJ0&t=9.24s)]
*  But now, on day two of this conclave, the Catholic Church, 1.4 billion Catholics, we [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojgCkcwhyJ0&t=13.68s)]
*  have a new pope. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojgCkcwhyJ0&t=23.64s)]
*  Bishop, what's your reaction? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojgCkcwhyJ0&t=24.64s)]
*  I'm surprised that it came so early. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojgCkcwhyJ0&t=32.88s)]
*  This is like it was 12 years ago with Francis. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojgCkcwhyJ0&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  It's telling me, I'm just guessing here, that maybe one of the people that really was predicted [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojgCkcwhyJ0&t=38.4s)]
*  did get elected because it became more of a contested conclave that would have gone [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojgCkcwhyJ0&t=43.0s)]
*  on for another day or so. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojgCkcwhyJ0&t=47.24s)]
*  That's what it's telling me. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojgCkcwhyJ0&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  So I'm guessing maybe a cardinal paroling, but who knows? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojgCkcwhyJ0&t=50.36s)]
*  I'm a little surprised it's come so soon. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojgCkcwhyJ0&t=54.199999999999996s)]
*  So one of the things that we had been looking for in this is exactly, and that was the question [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojgCkcwhyJ0&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  I was about to ask Susan, would it tell us something about what was going on? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojgCkcwhyJ0&t=63.16s)]
*  And oh, look at the people jumping up and down. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojgCkcwhyJ0&t=67.67999999999999s)]
*  Susan, I'm going to come to you in a minute, but because you can see it, Claudio, tell [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojgCkcwhyJ0&t=70.36s)]
*  us what you're seeing, what you're hearing in that square right now at 6.09 p.m. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojgCkcwhyJ0&t=75.6s)]
*  time. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojgCkcwhyJ0&t=81.12s)]
*  Well, the St. Peter's Square has exploded. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojgCkcwhyJ0&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  You can probably see it behind me. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojgCkcwhyJ0&t=86.56s)]
*  Everybody's screaming. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojgCkcwhyJ0&t=88.56s)]
*  There's a lot of applause, a lot of singing, there are flags waving. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojgCkcwhyJ0&t=89.96000000000001s)]
*  And of course, you know, it's a surprise for everyone. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojgCkcwhyJ0&t=95.72s)]
*  I was just saying five minutes ago that I thought that we thought that the first vote [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojgCkcwhyJ0&t=98.2s)]
*  wasn't successful. You can hear it now. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojgCkcwhyJ0&t=103.72s)]
*  Now the bells of St. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojgCkcwhyJ0&t=105.68s)]
*  Peter's Basilica are now ringing. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojgCkcwhyJ0&t=106.88s)]
*  That is yet another sign, the confirmation that a pope has been elected. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojgCkcwhyJ0&t=109.72s)]
*  Well, what's going to happen now, probably as it happens for every time a pope is elected, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojgCkcwhyJ0&t=115.64s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of people are going to run to the Vatican from all over Rome because [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojgCkcwhyJ0&t=121.32s)]
*  in less than an hour, we're going to see on that balcony the pope appear. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojgCkcwhyJ0&t=127.12s)]
*  We're not going to know who it is until he appears on the balcony, well, until his name [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojgCkcwhyJ0&t=133.20000000000002s)]
*  is announced on that balcony. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojgCkcwhyJ0&t=138.44s)]
*  And the first words we're going to hear, of course, is, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojgCkcwhyJ0&t=140.72s)]
*  Habemus Papam. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojgCkcwhyJ0&t=144.24s)]
*  We have a pope. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojgCkcwhyJ0&t=146.0s)]
*  But just listen. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojgCkcwhyJ0&t=147.84s)]
