# 'Could affect generations': Doctor warns about impact of Florida banning fluoride from water
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c)
*  Florida just joined Utah in banning fluoride in the state's drinking water, despite the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=0.0s)]
*  long-standing scientifically proven effects that fluoride strengthens teeth. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=5.76s)]
*  Our Surgeon General, Dr. Joseph Latopo, has really led the charge by going to counties [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=13.0s)]
*  and saying, forcing fluoride into your water is actually not good. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=18.6s)]
*  There's risks associated with that for pregnant women, for young people, for kids. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=24.08s)]
*  And yes, use fluoride for your teeth, that's fine, but forcing it into the water supply [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=29.04s)]
*  is basically forced medication on people. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  They don't have a choice. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=37.44s)]
*  You're taking that away from them. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=38.44s)]
*  Joining us now, former Obama White House Health Policy Director and NBC News medical contributor, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=41.04s)]
*  Dr. Kavita Patel. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=46.0s)]
*  What's going on with the newfound mistrust of fluoride? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=48.68s)]
*  Katie, I think there's been some developments, and by the way, some evidence that's been [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=54.84s)]
*  deemed to be kind of what I would call low quality, even peer reviews have said that [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=60.28s)]
*  some of the evidence that was linking fluoridation of water to decrease in IQ were largely dismissed [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=64.24s)]
*  because they report quality studies. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=70.32s)]
*  But I think you're seeing a theme here, especially with the administration, both federally and [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=71.6s)]
*  then, of course, in the state of Florida, where there are these kind of misinformation [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=75.48s)]
*  pieces of things that said fluoride, for example, is leading to a low IQ and even the governor's [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=79.92s)]
*  language around forced medication. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=84.88000000000001s)]
*  I hardly think, Katie, you would argue with me if I said we shouldn't be drinking out [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=86.88000000000001s)]
*  of well water that's not treated or out of river or contaminated water without purifying [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=91.42s)]
*  it. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  That's not necessarily medicating it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=97.24000000000001s)]
*  That's making sure that what we have is healthy for people. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  That's what fluoride has done as an additive. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=101.60000000000001s)]
*  70% of the state of Florida has had fluoridation. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=104.28s)]
*  This will remove it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=108.2s)]
*  I just want to cite a statistic, Katie, that one in four Floridians in grade school has [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=109.2s)]
*  significant dental caries. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=114.56s)]
*  So this is hardly a problem that's been dealt with. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=115.96000000000001s)]
*  The benefits of fluoride far outweigh the risks. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=118.14s)]
*  So Hawaii is a state that has not ever, or at least not in modern history, mandated fluoride [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=121.80000000000001s)]
*  in the water. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=129.8s)]
*  11% of the state's residents get it and it has the highest prevalence of tooth decay [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=130.8s)]
*  among children. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=136.96s)]
*  So the fluoride in the water, the fluoride in the tap water, how does that go, how does [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=138.52s)]
*  that help prevent me having to go to the dentist every few months? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=142.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=147.84s)]
*  And you hit on the most important point. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=148.84s)]
*  And I do think just to give credit where there is evidence that yes, if you obtain regular [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=150.48000000000002s)]
*  dental visits from like kind of the time that you are a toddler, then dentists are [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=155.68s)]
*  putting fluoride on your teeth. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=160.52s)]
*  I'm sure Katie, you've seen that with your children, my children and us as adults. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=161.72s)]
*  So the fluoridation that we get on our teeth as well as in our diet, if you have an adequate [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=164.92000000000002s)]
*  diet is sufficient. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=169.68s)]
*  However, for decades, we know that like you cited in the state of Hawaii, and by the way, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=171.32s)]
*  many states still in the country, that when you have lower levels of fluoride in the water, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=176.16s)]
*  that's not because people are now also then going to the dentist. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=181.0s)]
*  And so the fluoride in the water helps give you the fluoride in your system that you need [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=184.64s)]
*  to prevent tooth enamel deterioration, tooth decay that leads to cavities. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=188.44s)]
*  And Katie, this is just another kind of statistic. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=194.28s)]
*  We think about oral health as just being limited to the mouth. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=196.34s)]
*  I've seen children who have had unfortunately dental caries or cavities that lead to sepsis [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=198.6s)]
*  that has unfortunately led to death. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=203.6s)]
*  So this is whole person health, not just one part of your body. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=205.16s)]
*  There's also a link between oral health and cardiovascular health. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=208.79999999999998s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=212.88s)]
*  It's not limited. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=213.88s)]
*  I think dentists grimace when they think that what they're doing is just limited to the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=215.4s)]
*  mouth or to the mouth cavity. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=219.2s)]
*  It's linked to all of your health, including mental health. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=221.44s)]
*  So fluoride in the water was done as a nation's call to respond to a public health crisis, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=223.64s)]
*  not just in the form of tooth decay, but all the other problems that are linked to tooth [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=230.2s)]
*  decay. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=234.16s)]
*  And so fluoridation in the water, by the way, has been a goal for several decades. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=235.16s)]
*  We've made progress in the United States. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=239.0s)]
*  And I'm fearful that like with other pieces of public health, we are actually reversing [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=240.76s)]
*  that progress. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=245.44s)]
*  And now we're not even sure that we're going to have the data systems to be able to know [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=246.44s)]
*  what deterioration we have because parts of the CDC have been taken down that monitor [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=250.32s)]
*  oral health. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=255.06s)]
*  Many states don't have the funding, resources or talent to monitor this. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=256.36s)]
*  So Katie, this is going to be something that we're going to have to deal with, not just [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=259.76s)]
*  for a couple of years. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=262.52s)]
*  It could affect generations. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=264.08s)]
*  And let me just mention that oftentimes dentists are not a part of health coverage plans. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=265.08s)]
*  So if you're going to the dentist to get your teeth taken care of, you're paying out of [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=269.40000000000003s)]
*  pocket. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=272.8s)]
*  And if you have tooth decay, you're going to have to go a lot more frequently. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=273.8s)]
*  This is right now a state by state decision. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=277.96000000000004s)]
*  Any chance of this becoming a federal decision? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=279.8s)]
*  Can that happen? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=282.22s)]
*  I think you heard some kind of references to that in Secretary Kennedy's testimony in [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=284.12s)]
*  front of the House and Senate that this was something that he was asking the FDA commissioner [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=288.16s)]
*  to look at. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=292.96000000000004s)]
*  It's something that other leaders in the Trump administration and the health side have actually [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=293.96000000000004s)]
*  made comments around. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=298.6s)]
*  So there are limits. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=299.92s)]
*  This is always likely going to come down to what a state should and could do. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=301.5s)]
*  So even if there were some federal guidance or if the EPA, the Environmental Protection [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=305.20000000000005s)]
*  Agency withdrew some of their requirements, if you did fluoridate your water, I do still [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=309.06s)]
*  think states will have kind of the ultimate call here. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=314.88s)]
*  But again, the federal state relationship, by the way, not to mention the American Academy [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=317.48s)]
*  of Pediatrics, the American Dental Association, the American Public Health Association and [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=321.88s)]
*  the number of other medical associations have made it very clear that these benefits [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=325.28s)]
*  outweigh the risks. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=330.11999999999995s)]
*  And even though the evidence is showing that we're making progress because people are going [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=331.59999999999997s)]
*  to the dentist, that people have more access on their teeth treatments and in their food, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=335.03999999999996s)]
*  that doesn't mean that we should take away the benefits that are coming from putting [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=341.08s)]
*  it in the water. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM36DoDjc4c&t=344.44s)]
