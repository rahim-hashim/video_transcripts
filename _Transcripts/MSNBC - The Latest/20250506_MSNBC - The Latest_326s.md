# Hegseth used multiple Signal chats for official Pentagon business: WSJ
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ)
*  Okay, so General Hurtling, help people who are not in the military understand this. And I know you [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=0.0s)]
*  understand it personally, because when you served as the commander of U.S. Army troops in Europe, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=3.84s)]
*  you were a three-star general doing a role that had historically been done by somebody with a [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=8.88s)]
*  four-star rank. So I wonder what you make of Secretary Hegseth's argument that too many [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=13.84s)]
*  generals leads to wasteful spending, too much bureaucratic decision-making, and we know for a [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=18.96s)]
*  long time he's worried about the politicization of leadership at the Pentagon. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I know this is going to be hard for you to believe, Chris, but I agree with the attempt [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=29.36s)]
*  to decrease the number of general officers and flag officers. That includes Navy admirals in the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=33.84s)]
*  force. It's a good idea to analyze all the combatant command headquarters, take a look at [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=38.8s)]
*  savings and position and rank structure across the board, looking at consolidating headquarters, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=44.24s)]
*  as Courtney just said. But there's some problems in the analysis and what Secretary Hegseth said [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=49.92s)]
*  as he read the order that he's going to give yesterday in that film, an elongated version of [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=56.56s)]
*  that film you just showed. What he's saying is 10%, 20%, he's looking at different percentages. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=61.92s)]
*  That's a very bad way to analyze and conduct force structure redesign. The other thing that's [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=69.04s)]
*  important to know about this is this isn't his duty alone. In fact, it's the congressional [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=76.4s)]
*  responsibility in Article 1, Section 8, to raise and support Army. That includes the number of [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=82.8s)]
*  generals that are in the rank. Many people don't know this, but there is actually a number that's [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=90.64s)]
*  dictated by law in terms of what generals, how many generals and admirals should be in the force. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=95.76s)]
*  So again, it's a good idea. He's trying to do it fast. It's more of the so-called shock and [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=101.76s)]
*  awe that I think the administration is attempting to do. But when you do that shock and awe, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=109.44s)]
*  you find out that a lack of planning, if you're trying to do it expeditionously, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=114.16s)]
*  there are going to be some problems. The secretary noted the unified command plan and how that came [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=119.6s)]
*  up with some of the combatant commands, as Courtney said, the different headquarters. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=125.44s)]
*  That's all been studied in the past, and there were some good reasons for the creation of that. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=130.88s)]
*  This isn't a bunch of generals coming together and say, hey, let's build more headquarters so [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=135.6s)]
*  we have jobs. This has to do with worldwide threats and the kinds of things that the United [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=140.32s)]
*  States military faces around the globe. Let me ask you about something else that the Wall Street [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=145.44s)]
*  Journal is actually reporting, that Secretary Hegseth used the controversial Signal Messaging [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  app for official Pentagon business much more extensively than we knew before, saying he, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=156.79999999999998s)]
*  engaged in at least a dozen separate chats, according to people familiar with his management [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=162.56s)]
*  practices. And in one case, he told aides on the encrypted app to inform foreign governments about [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=167.68s)]
*  an unfolding military operation. He also used the non-governmental message service to discuss [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=174.56s)]
*  media appearances, foreign travel, his schedule, and other unclassified but sensitive information. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=180.56s)]
*  Does this raise questions for you? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=187.84s)]
*  Yeah, it does, and it always has. And I've been speaking out against this since the first Signals [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=190.48s)]
*  app process became known to all of America. It's a bad approach. There are types of [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=195.76s)]
*  communication devices provided to senior leaders and even junior leaders in the military to keep [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=206.39999999999998s)]
*  this kind of information secure. And if someone says, oh, it's no big deal, it's an encrypted app, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=213.04000000000002s)]
*  let me tell you, other foreign adversaries can get into those encryptions and find patterns of life [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=219.68s)]
*  and intelligence that they can connect the dots. Ten years ago, when I was in the army, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=226.88000000000002s)]
*  we were told to leave computers and cell phones at the time, Blackberries, away from us and not [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=232.4s)]
*  take them into some foreign countries because of the possibility that information on those devices [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=238.48s)]
*  would be leaked. It's not only the signal chat that is leaked, it's other potential ways to get [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=244.23999999999998s)]
*  into these kind of signal devices that are truthfully unclassified. So you can have an app [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=249.83999999999997s)]
*  that causes the message to disappear or that you think is encrypted, but there are other ways to [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=255.35999999999999s)]
*  get into phones and the kind of devices these people are using that will give away America's [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=260.88s)]
*  secrets. Then taking it to the next level, as you just reported, that they were using it for [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=266.64s)]
*  information that should be kept secure, you're giving our America's foes information about [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=271.68s)]
*  patterns of life, movements of officials, intelligence that they can connect the dots on, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=278.8s)]
*  and it causes harm to America's security. So there's a reason why most in government are told [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=285.84s)]
*  don't use commercial apps. Use the millions of dollars worth of equipment we give you [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=292.8s)]
*  in classified information flow to keep others from understanding what the United States government is [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=298.56s)]
*  doing. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=304.88s)]
*  you [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bvUa322QhQ&t=322.8s)]
