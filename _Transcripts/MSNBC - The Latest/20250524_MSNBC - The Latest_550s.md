# Fmr. Federal Prosecutor: Harvard has ‘strong case’ against the Trump administration
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs)
*  But we begin this hour with President Donald Trump's ongoing battle with higher education [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=0.0s)]
*  facing a dramatic escalation. A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's attempt [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=5.04s)]
*  to ban international students from enrollment at Harvard, at least for now. That order came just [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=10.8s)]
*  hours after the Ivy League school sued the Trump administration over the move. It's all part of [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=16.56s)]
*  the administration's efforts to pressure Harvard to fall in line with Trump's demands on what it [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=22.64s)]
*  calls rampant anti-Semitism and leftist ideology in college campuses. In its lawsuit, Harvard said [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=28.24s)]
*  the Trump administration was carrying out a, quote, campaign of retribution against the school. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=36.4s)]
*  The university has nearly 7,000 international students, which makes up about 27 percent of [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  the entire student body this school year. Those students were told they would need to transfer [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=49.36s)]
*  to other schools or leave the country. However, due to the judge's ruling yesterday, they are safe [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=55.6s)]
*  for the time being. A hearing is scheduled for Tuesday. Joining us now, Ankash Kudari, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=63.52s)]
*  former federal prosecutor and a senior writer at Politico Magazine. Ankash, welcome back. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=70.0s)]
*  So the easy question is the first question. How strong is Harvard's case against the administration [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=76.08s)]
*  here? Look, I think it's pretty strong. Anytime you have the government punishing a private party [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=82.72s)]
*  for their expressive activity, in this case, Harvard is saying how we determine our curriculum, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=90.4s)]
*  how we run our campus, these are all things that should be within our control, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=94.8s)]
*  you're going to run into a First Amendment violation. The same thing applies if you [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=98.24s)]
*  withdraw a benefit, right? So in this case, the sort of the rules that permit them to bring in [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=101.6s)]
*  these foreign students. So on its face, you're going to have a pretty strong First Amendment claim. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=108.64s)]
*  I will say the administration will likely be advancing one particular element of this in [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=113.28s)]
*  their defense, which is the fact that these are international students may implicate the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=118.64s)]
*  administration's foreign policy and diplomatic prerogatives. And that we have seen time and time [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=122.88s)]
*  again, actually, since the start of this administration, they've been leaning hard on [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=128.48s)]
*  that sort of theme whenever they can in their legal fights because the courts tend to be more [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=132.0s)]
*  deferential in those areas. So this is when I imagine that where they'll try to slide it [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=137.12s)]
*  into that realm. We see even on the tariffs, the tariff litigation, they're saying, oh, this is [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  about international relations, and it's just going to affect our diplomacy and standing and all that. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=146.08s)]
*  So I would expect that they will be advancing that, the government will be advancing that. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=150.24s)]
*  But look, on its face, it's retaliatory and Harvard has a good case, but we'll see how it goes. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=153.68s)]
*  I mean, retaliatory and kind of all of government approach to retaliation, right? Because you have [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=158.72s)]
*  Kristi Noem, the DHS secretary going on Fox News Thursday, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=164.64s)]
*  basically threatening other universities that they could be next. Look at this. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=168.55999999999997s)]
*  This should be a warning to every other university to get your act together, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=174.88s)]
*  get your act together, because we are coming to make sure that these programs, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=178.48s)]
*  that you are facilitating an environment where students can learn, where they're safe, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=183.04s)]
*  and that they're not discriminated against based on their race or their religion. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=186.88s)]
*  She's not the education secretary, just to be clear, but— [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=191.28s)]
*  I have to say, it is not helpful for the government's own position to have the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=196.16000000000003s)]
*  secretary of home and security saying, we are coming for you. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=200.48000000000002s)]
*  Okay, so that's my question. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=203.04000000000002s)]
*  It sounds retaliatory. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=203.52s)]
*  That's my question. So it makes it very clear. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=204.56s)]
*  So what seems to be happening—I'm not no lawyer, you are. If I'm someone who is going to try and do [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  something a little sneaky, I might not want to go on Fox News and talk about it, because at the end [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=214.0s)]
*  of the day, someone like you is going to come in and say, well, let's show this Fox News clip. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=217.76s)]
*  They already said they were retaliatory. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=222.0s)]
*  Nome has had this problem repeatedly. She made a fool of herself on habeas corpus, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=223.92s)]
*  not knowing what it is this week. When she went down to El Salvador with her $50,000 Rolex, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=227.84s)]
*  touring a prison, and then shooting promo videos, I mean, the whole thing is ridiculous. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=233.51999999999998s)]
*  It's like surreal from a terrible movie. So she, as ascendant, has ascended in Trump world, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=237.76s)]
*  but I don't think she's actually effectively serving her real constituents, which are the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=244.8s)]
*  country writ large. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=249.84s)]
*  Well, like so many things with Trump, there are so many legal battles now up in the air [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=250.96s)]
*  that it's hard to know what to follow. There's the forced deportations of people who are legally in [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=256.8s)]
*  the United States. There's this. There's just so much. What should we really be watching? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=262.48s)]
*  You know, that is such a difficult question. I think about it all the time. I have to think [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=268.88s)]
*  about it every day. Right. And, you know, look, the easy answer is all of the above, but the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=272.16s)]
*  real answer is we do have to prioritize. And, you know, I think what is happening in the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=276.40000000000003s)]
*  immigration setting is very important in terms of the erosion of due process and the precedent [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=282.16s)]
*  it may set for the future, not just in the next few years, but even for future generations. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=286.64000000000004s)]
*  I think the way in which the administration has really tried to advance very aggressive [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  theories of executive power surrounding spending and firing employees, those things, I think, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=296.8s)]
*  are very important and will need to be resolved. The dismantling of certain agencies, these things [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=301.84s)]
*  are moving through the courts. And they're just as important, if not more important, quite honestly, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=306.56s)]
*  than what's happening at Harvard on any given day. But it is also very important what's happening [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=312.23999999999995s)]
*  there. Hey, Ankush, I need you to help me square the circle here to borrow a phrase from Eugene [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=316.32s)]
*  a couple of weeks ago. So we're talking about the president and what he's doing to Harvard today. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=323.28s)]
*  Listen to what Donald Trump had to say in 2024 in a podcast interview about giving green cards to [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=330.32s)]
*  foreign college students. Watch this or listen to this. It's so sad when we lose people from Harvard, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=339.12s)]
*  MIT, from the greatest schools. What I want to do and what I will do is you graduate from a college. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=345.91999999999996s)]
*  I think you should get automatically as part of your diploma a green card to be able to stay in [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=352.24s)]
*  this country. And we force the brilliant people, the people that graduate from college, the people [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=356.88s)]
*  that are number one in their class from the best colleges, you have to be able to recruit these [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=361.6s)]
*  people and keep the people. Okay, so I'm waiting for you to square that circle. I will not be able [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=366.88s)]
*  to do that, unfortunately. Look, you cannot reconcile Trump's prior accurate acknowledgement [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=375.04s)]
*  of the importance of international students to the universities in this country with what is now [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=382.24s)]
*  happening here in terms of undermining that asset, which is a big asset that we have in this country [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=387.52s)]
*  and trying to erode that. So they're not reconcilable statements except on the basis that [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=395.12s)]
*  he's changed his mind because he's got this thing about Harvard sort of in his head now. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=401.6s)]
*  So in terms of the MAGA populist right, this is something they like and this is Trump standing up [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=404.96000000000004s)]
*  for Americans and keeping out the foreigners. But then you see a couple of months ago where [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=410.4s)]
*  Trump actually took a stand that that camp didn't like and sided with Elon in Silicon Valley on visas [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=415.44s)]
*  for talented engineers. So it's very hard. This is also whiplash, figuring out what his philosophy is [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=422.23999999999995s)]
*  other than strictly retribution and who has his ear at the last moment. Well, you hit on the point [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=428.71999999999997s)]
*  right there, I think, which is when people are acting erratically, the motives aren't coherent, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=433.91999999999996s)]
*  they're retaliatory, they're personal, they're vindictive. You know, one of the things that I [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=439.12s)]
*  can't get my head around is what they're actually trying to do here, right? Because sure, there's [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=445.68s)]
*  retribution. Is it just red meat to the base? Is it just like telling the MAGA folks, you know, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=452.8s)]
*  we're going to fight for you, you know, or going against the elites? Because at the end of the day, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=457.84000000000003s)]
*  they don't actually care that much about who was in that Harvard. They want to control what Harvard [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=462.96s)]
*  is teaching and doing. Am I crazy? No, I think that is right. Look, you know, the Trump second [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=467.76s)]
*  administration comprises a bunch of different ideological factions within the conservative [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=473.2s)]
*  movement and the MAGA, right? From the MAGA side of the movement, I don't mean to be pejorative. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=479.35999999999996s)]
*  But one element of that is a group of people who are very angry about higher education in this [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=484.4s)]
*  country and who think it really needs to be brought to heel. And so if you are going to [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=489.52000000000004s)]
*  attempt to do something like that, you do aim at the biggest target available in the hope that you [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=493.28000000000003s)]
*  will deter people or bring other people in line. That's why Kristi Noem is out there saying we're [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=497.28000000000003s)]
*  coming after you. So I think it is more coherent than just maybe even simply the retaliation for [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=501.12s)]
*  Trump. There are people within, in and around his administration who are very interested in this and [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=506.32s)]
*  really want to accomplish the things that Kristi Noem is describing in terms of bringing them to [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=511.28000000000003s)]
*  heel, exercising control over their curriculum, exercising who is on their campus, what they are [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=515.44s)]
*  doing, who they are even hiring. So it is not entirely accidental. I think that movement is bad [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=521.44s)]
*  for the country, but it exists. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxrh_YISCxs&t=526.5600000000001s)]
