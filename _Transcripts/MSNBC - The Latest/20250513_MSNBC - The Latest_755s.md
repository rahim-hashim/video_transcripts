# Real purpose of Trump's Mideast trip comes into focus as his explanations fall apart under scrutiny
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk)
*  This was the scene on Capitol Hill today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=0.0s)]
*  Members of the disability community, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=2.44s)]
*  you can see them right there in the video, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=4.44s)]
*  showed up at a House committee meeting [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=6.44s)]
*  to protest Republicans' proposed changes [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=8.68s)]
*  to Medicaid in their budget bill, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=11.18s)]
*  changes that the Congressional Budget Office says [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=13.08s)]
*  could cause millions of Americans [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=15.48s)]
*  to lose insurance coverage. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=17.68s)]
*  What better to protest? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=19.56s)]
*  Now, the people there, you can see them all, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=21.26s)]
*  they're voicing their freedom of speech right there. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=23.32s)]
*  They interrupted the meeting with shouts [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=26.86s)]
*  of no cuts to Medicaid, no cuts to Medicaid, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=28.639999999999997s)]
*  and were promptly escorted out of the building [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=31.64s)]
*  by police officers, 25 of them were arrested. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=33.6s)]
*  And then, even after all that, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=36.599999999999994s)]
*  Republicans went forward with their first step [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=38.64s)]
*  toward enacting those Medicaid cuts. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=40.839999999999996s)]
*  And that all created what I would consider [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=44.18s)]
*  quite a split-screen moment today, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=46.36s)]
*  because as those concerned citizens, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=48.76s)]
*  you just saw protesting in the House [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  what the impact of Medicaid cuts would be on their lives [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=52.56s)]
*  and many of the lives of their friends and colleagues [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=55.46s)]
*  around the country, where was Donald Trump? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=59.16s)]
*  Well, the President of the United States [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=61.22s)]
*  was nearly 7,000 miles away, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=62.46s)]
*  sitting in a gilded palace surrounded by billionaires. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=64.82s)]
*  Now, the stated reason for his visit to Saudi Arabia [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=69.5s)]
*  and his palling around with the Crown Prince, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=72.86s)]
*  Mohammed bin Salman, also known as MBS, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=75.84s)]
*  and a man perhaps best known for personally approving [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=78.38s)]
*  the murder of an American journalist, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=81.58s)]
*  was to get them to invest in American businesses. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=83.78s)]
*  Trump claimed at the outset of his trip [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=87.33999999999999s)]
*  that he was going to get the Saudis [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=89.63999999999999s)]
*  to invest a whopping $1 trillion in the US, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=91.27999999999999s)]
*  which is a lot of money. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=94.96s)]
*  But it turns out his math was pretty far off, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=97.05999999999999s)]
*  because MBS said his country plans [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=101.05999999999999s)]
*  to invest $600 billion in the US, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=103.89999999999999s)]
*  well, short of Trump's $1 trillion figure. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=106.56s)]
*  Still a lot of money, still a lot of money, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=109.16s)]
*  but there were more wrinkles to it, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=111.5s)]
*  because the New York Times looked into this, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=113.19999999999999s)]
*  and then they noted neither the Trump numbers [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=115.16s)]
*  or the Saudi numbers are remotely even possible. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=117.9s)]
*  Here's what they said. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=120.8s)]
*  The figure Mr. Trump is seeking [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=122.2s)]
*  exceeds the value of all assets [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=123.98s)]
*  in the kingdom's hefty sovereign wealth fund, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=126.1s)]
*  meaning there's no way they can come up with that money. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=129.04s)]
*  One expert told the Times, quote, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=131.32s)]
*  "'I don't see how they get anywhere close to $600 billion, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=133.14s)]
*  "'let alone $1 trillion.'" [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=136.42000000000002s)]
*  Okay, that's where we are with the math. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=139.22s)]
*  Then that leads us to today, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=141.7s)]
*  when Trump arrived in Saudi Arabia, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=143.42000000000002s)]
*  he was met with big signs, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=145.52s)]
*  boasting that the Saudis would be investing $300 billion. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  You can see the sign right there. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=152.06s)]
*  They literally made that sign, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=153.26s)]
*  signage in advance in the US. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=154.8s)]
*  They made it, but they made it for the trip. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=157.14000000000001s)]
*  Now that is obviously quite a bit less. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=160.70000000000002s)]
*  It's actually less than a third of what Trump originally said. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=163.3s)]
*  Let's be honest, this is something we have come to expect, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=167.64000000000001s)]
*  right, from Donald Trump. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=170.34s)]
*  He loves to move the goalposts, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=171.34s)]
*  and he's moved them constantly [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=173.56s)]
*  all the course of the time he's been in office, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=175.29999999999998s)]
*  certainly during his first administration. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=177.34s)]
*  Remember back in his first term, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=179.79999999999998s)]
*  the Trump White House announced a controversial deal [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=181.57999999999998s)]
*  to sell $110 billion worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=183.67999999999998s)]
*  $110 billion. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=187.32s)]
*  This was all right around the same time [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=188.88s)]
*  that the Saudi government brutally murdered [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=191.28s)]
*  and dismembered American journalist, Jamal Khashoggi. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  And a lot of people, including even Republicans, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=196.56s)]
*  did not want Trump to reward Saudi Arabia [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=199.26s)]
*  with this big arms deal. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=201.42000000000002s)]
*  But the Trump administration went forward with it anyway, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=203.42000000000002s)]
*  claiming the deal would potentially support [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=205.82s)]
*  tens of thousands of new jobs in the United States. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=208.06s)]
*  And I will tell you, the phrase potentially supporting [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=211.1s)]
*  was doing a whole lot of heavy lifting in that sentence, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=213.70000000000002s)]
*  because Trump boasted about this deal repeatedly. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=218.04000000000002s)]
*  And every time he did, the numbers kept changing. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=220.94s)]
*  Do you see a pattern here? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=224.94s)]
*  I mean, they changed a lot in this case, watch this. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=226.18s)]
*  We're talking about over 40,000 jobs in the United States. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=229.48000000000002s)]
*  It's 450,000 jobs. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=235.72s)]
*  Who are we hurting? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=239.02s)]
*  It's 500,000 jobs. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=239.86s)]
*  $110 billion worth of work, which means 600,000 jobs. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=242.56s)]
*  You're talking about over a million jobs. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=248.4s)]
*  I mean, from 40,000 jobs to over a million jobs, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=254.18s)]
*  that was in the span of just seven months, by the way, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=257.85999999999996s)]
*  all those clips. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=259.7s)]
*  Now, in the end, Saudi Arabia didn't even purchase [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=261.44s)]
*  the whole $110 billion worth of weapons [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=263.53999999999996s)]
*  that Trump announced in the first place. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=265.64s)]
*  In fact, they actually spent less money [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=267.58s)]
*  on American goods and services [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=269.38s)]
*  than they did during Barack Obama's second term. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=270.73999999999995s)]
*  It was all kind of a big shell game. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=274.03999999999996s)]
*  And that appears to be exactly [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=277.44s)]
*  what we're seeing this time around as well. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=278.67999999999995s)]
*  I mean, by now you have definitely heard [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=280.96s)]
*  that one of Trump's biggest agenda items [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=283.08s)]
*  on this Middle East trip is to accept [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=285.41999999999996s)]
*  a big $400 million luxury plane [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=287.09999999999997s)]
*  as a gift from the nation of Qatar. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=289.59999999999997s)]
*  He wants the plane to become the new Air Force One, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=291.64s)]
*  but only for the duration of his presidency, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=295.52s)]
*  after which ownership of the plane [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=297.71999999999997s)]
*  would be transferred to Trump's presidential library. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=299.21999999999997s)]
*  How convenient is all of that? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=302.02s)]
*  Now, the whole thing is obviously super shady. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=304.52s)]
*  We're gonna talk to a bunch of people about it tonight. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=306.91999999999996s)]
*  And even a lot of conservatives [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=309.46s)]
*  don't want Trump to accept this plane. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=310.56s)]
*  But Trump says it's too good a deal to pass up. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=312.79999999999995s)]
*  In a post on a social media site, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=316.98s)]
*  he called the new plane a gift free of charge [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=318.28000000000003s)]
*  in all caps internet shouting style, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=321.56s)]
*  which is definitely not true either. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=324.42s)]
*  I mean, look at this reporting from Politico. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=326.66s)]
*  They say a private contractor [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=329.02000000000004s)]
*  would have to rip the jet apart [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=330.76000000000005s)]
*  to turn it into a flying White House [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=332.24s)]
*  for the president with secure communications [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=334.06s)]
*  and classified upgrades. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=336.3s)]
*  That is certainly what is on Air Force One, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=337.66s)]
*  an expensive and complicated prospect [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=339.90000000000003s)]
*  that could cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=342.56s)]
*  Add to that the significant cost of sweeping the aircraft [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=347.56s)]
*  for software modifications or embedded foreign tech. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=350.24s)]
*  So Trump's big free of charge gift plane [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=354.76000000000005s)]
*  looks a lot more expensive when you factor all that in. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=358.24s)]
*  And bear in mind the US government [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=361.40000000000003s)]
*  is already spending billions of dollars [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=362.72s)]
*  on building two new Air Force One planes [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=364.52000000000004s)]
*  right here in the US, made by an American company. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=366.90000000000003s)]
*  But Trump doesn't care about these costs [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=370.54s)]
*  for the American taxpayer. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=373.22s)]
*  Obviously he doesn't. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=374.62s)]
*  What he really cares about is his new palace in the sky. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=376.3s)]
*  And of course, big checks for his billionaire buddies. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=379.90000000000003s)]
*  As you know, we have the biggest business leaders [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=385.5s)]
*  in the world here. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=388.3s)]
*  They're gonna walk away with a lot of checks. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=389.14s)]
*  I mean, he doesn't even hide it sometimes. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=392.94s)]
*  They're going to walk away with a lot of checks. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=395.42s)]
*  That's what the billionaires are getting out of this trip. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=398.15999999999997s)]
*  The question is, I mean, he's there [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=401.76s)]
*  as the US American president. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=403.2s)]
*  What are the American people getting out of this trip? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=405.12s)]
*  Because if this trip won't actually create [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=407.91999999999996s)]
*  a million American jobs, which it clearly won't, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=409.5s)]
*  if the $400 million plane could actually cost taxpayers [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=412.0s)]
*  hundreds of millions of dollars, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=415.96s)]
*  if all of Trump's stated reasons for making this trip [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=418.03999999999996s)]
*  his first big trip abroad, if all of those stated reasons [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=421.06s)]
*  aren't really standing up even to the slightest bit [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=424.84s)]
*  of scrutiny, I mean, I've just like scratched [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=427.21999999999997s)]
*  the surface here, then why is Trump really there? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=428.82s)]
*  Well, for the same reason all those billionaires are there. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=432.86s)]
*  Lots and lots of money. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=435.42s)]
*  Not for the American taxpayer, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=438.3s)]
*  but for Trump and his family directly. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=440.82s)]
*  I remember none of this is exactly new. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=443.53999999999996s)]
*  I mean, do you remember how universally Trump was shunned [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=446.14s)]
*  after January 6th? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=448.68s)]
*  Banks cut ties with Trump, social media companies [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=450.41999999999996s)]
*  kicked him off their platforms. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=452.98s)]
*  Just to name a few companies, AT&T, Amazon, Best Buy, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=454.85999999999996s)]
*  Marriott, Walmart, Airbnb, Disney, American Airlines, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=458.94s)]
*  UPS, General Motors, Coca-Cola, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=462.9s)]
*  the list of companies could go on and on [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=465.53999999999996s)]
*  that actively distanced themselves from Trump [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=467.94s)]
*  after January 6th. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=470.29999999999995s)]
*  And there was one type of company though, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=472.65999999999997s)]
*  that shunned Trump in a way that really, really stung him. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=474.91999999999996s)]
*  The Professional Golfers Association, the PGA. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=479.05999999999995s)]
*  They cut ties with Trump, remember this? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=482.02s)]
*  The league canceled their championship [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=485.04s)]
*  at Trump's Bedminster Golf Club. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=486.44s)]
*  Across the pond in England, their professional golf league [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=488.52000000000004s)]
*  dropped Trump as a potential host for their championship, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=490.72s)]
*  which for the owner of a golf-centered real estate empire [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=493.84000000000003s)]
*  was a pretty big blow. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=497.64000000000004s)]
*  Now at the time, Trump owned 17 golf courses [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=499.6s)]
*  around the world. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=501.64s)]
*  Some of them reportedly charging six figures [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=502.48s)]
*  just for the honor of being initiated as a member. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=504.76s)]
*  And while some of the price tag there came from people [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=508.76s)]
*  trying to gain access to the president, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=510.68s)]
*  in January of 2021 gaining access to Trump [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=513.18s)]
*  wasn't exactly a hot ticket. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=515.42s)]
*  But right now, as Trump's golf empire was losing, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=518.14s)]
*  but right as it was losing, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=521.14s)]
*  its biggest draws an entirely new league filled the void. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=522.64s)]
*  This is Live Golf. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=527.04s)]
*  When it launched in 2021, its slogan was golf but louder, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=528.52s)]
*  which seems like who made that up in a room? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=533.0799999999999s)]
*  I don't know, but that was its slogan. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=535.06s)]
*  And while the PGA and the British league RNA [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=537.5s)]
*  were cutting ties with Trump, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=539.4599999999999s)]
*  Live Golf was making lots of deals. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=540.72s)]
*  They hosted a tournament at Trump's golf club [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=543.72s)]
*  in Bedminster, New Jersey, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=545.6400000000001s)]
*  and another at Trump's golf club in Doral, Florida. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=547.2s)]
*  The league used hundreds of millions of dollars [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=550.5200000000001s)]
*  to attract golf's top athletes [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=552.32s)]
*  and make those tournaments at Trump properties [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=554.12s)]
*  actually matter to sports fans. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=556.6400000000001s)]
*  So who exactly was behind this brand new golf league [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=559.32s)]
*  that was saving Trump's golf empire and probably his ego? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=562.5600000000001s)]
*  Well, the Saudi sovereign wealth fund. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=567.08s)]
*  Now, if you're wondering where you remember [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=570.28s)]
*  the Saudi sovereign wealth fund from, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=572.24s)]
*  you may be thinking of when that same fund [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=573.92s)]
*  gave Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner's venture capital firm [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=576.48s)]
*  a cool $2 billion, just six months [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=579.64s)]
*  after Kushner himself left the White House. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=582.42s)]
*  Nice work if you can get it, I guess. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=585.2s)]
*  But if that wasn't enough, last year, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=588.0s)]
*  a real estate firm with deep ties [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=589.72s)]
*  to the Saudi Arabian government [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=591.4s)]
*  struck a deal for a new development project, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=592.88s)]
*  literally for a Trump Tower Saudi Arabia. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=595.36s)]
*  But of course, that is just some of the money [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=598.82s)]
*  that Trump and his family have received [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=601.0400000000001s)]
*  from one country on Trump's Middle East trip. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=602.5200000000001s)]
*  That is just the money from Saudi Arabia, one stop. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=605.1600000000001s)]
*  He's also set to visit Qatar and the UAE. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=608.0s)]
*  Now, just last month, Trump's adult son, Eric Trump, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=611.96s)]
*  flew to Qatar to sign a deal [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=613.88s)]
*  to build yet another Trump-branded golf course. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=615.24s)]
*  This one, which will be built by a Saudi Arabian developer [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=618.88s)]
*  and will be located just north of Qatar's capital city, Doha, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=621.6s)]
*  has a reported price tag of $5.5 billion [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=625.04s)]
*  and is reportedly set to include an 18-hole golf course, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=630.0799999999999s)]
*  a theme park, and beachfront villas. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=633.36s)]
*  Now, that deal was just linked last month, just last month. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=636.56s)]
*  And that, of course, comes on top [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=639.56s)]
*  of the $400 million plane Qatar [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=640.88s)]
*  is reportedly planning to gift Trump. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=642.96s)]
*  We'll come back and talk about that more this show for sure. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=645.16s)]
*  So that's just some of what Trump is getting [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=648.28s)]
*  from Saudi Arabian Qatar. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=649.72s)]
*  But he has a third stop, too. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=651.4s)]
*  What about the UAE? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=652.38s)]
*  What is he getting from them? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=653.36s)]
*  Well, these are the mockups [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=655.12s)]
*  from the new Trump International Hotel and Tower in Dubai. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=656.24s)]
*  Again, just last month, Trump's adult son, Eric, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=659.2s)]
*  inked a deal for the Saudi-linked development company, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=661.96s)]
*  Darglobal, to build this billion-dollar, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=664.5s)]
*  80-story tower in the UAE. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=667.36s)]
*  The plan's supposed to gym and a club called The Trump. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=670.4s)]
*  What's being built is the highest pool [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=675.88s)]
*  in the world on the roof, so there's that. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=677.58s)]
*  But most importantly, this joint that you see [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=680.4s)]
*  comes with 126 hotel rooms, 446 apartments, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=683.98s)]
*  with prices starting at just north of $8 million each. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=686.74s)]
*  And Penthouse is going for $20 million a pop. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=690.1s)]
*  Again, all nice work if you can get it, nice digs, too. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=693.82s)]
*  Now, I should say it's not really a new thing [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=697.94s)]
*  for foreign countries to shower US officials [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=699.66s)]
*  with inappropriate gifts or try to, but this is different. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=701.78s)]
*  For one thing, US officials typically turn down [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=706.08s)]
*  inappropriate gifts. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=709.04s)]
*  No sign of that here, we can see. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZAcDIx1vk&t=710.64s)]
