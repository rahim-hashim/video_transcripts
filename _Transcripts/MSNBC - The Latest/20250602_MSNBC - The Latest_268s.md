# 'We always aim for the walks to be peaceful': Group targeted in Boulder, Colorado attack speaks out
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNGKtFA5zk)
*  Joining us now is Shira Weiss, the volunteer global administrator of Run for Their Lives, the group that was targeted just yesterday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNGKtFA5zk&t=0.0s)]
*  She's also an NBC Universal colleague in our parent company's agency partnership team. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNGKtFA5zk&t=8.0s)]
*  Shira, I'm sorry we're talking under these circumstances. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNGKtFA5zk&t=13.0s)]
*  How is your team doing this morning, and how are you grappling with what's happened? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNGKtFA5zk&t=16.0s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me this morning. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNGKtFA5zk&t=21.0s)]
*  Yes, it's extremely devastating and disheartening to hear that one of our local communities in Boulder, Colorado, had this violent attack happen to them. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNGKtFA5zk&t=24.0s)]
*  Our thoughts and prayers are with them and the victims, and we're hoping for a speedy recovery for everybody. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNGKtFA5zk&t=35.0s)]
*  Can you tell us more about the event that was taking place, the people who were participating in your group's mission? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNGKtFA5zk&t=41.0s)]
*  Yes. So Run for Their Lives is a global mission. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNGKtFA5zk&t=47.0s)]
*  We were founded on October 15th, 2023, with the sole purpose of raising awareness for all of the hostages that were taken on October 7th. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNGKtFA5zk&t=53.0s)]
*  We're an apolitical organization. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNGKtFA5zk&t=65.0s)]
*  We strongly believe that this is an international humanitarian crisis, as different religions and ethnicities and nationalities were taken hostage. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNGKtFA5zk&t=68.0s)]
*  We always aim for the walks to be peaceful, nonviolent, and really as a means to just raise awareness to the situation. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNGKtFA5zk&t=78.0s)]
*  You know, people, 58 people have been held hostage now for 605 days, and we will continue to raise awareness until they are all brought home. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNGKtFA5zk&t=87.0s)]
*  We have talked about how there's been a rise over the past few years, frankly, of anti-Semitic crimes and violence. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNGKtFA5zk&t=97.0s)]
*  Had this Boulder chapter ever been threatened before, do you know? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNGKtFA5zk&t=105.0s)]
*  No, not to my knowledge. This is the first violent attack on any of our groups. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNGKtFA5zk&t=109.0s)]
*  We have over 230 groups worldwide. This is the first time anything like this has happened. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNGKtFA5zk&t=115.0s)]
*  In the past, there might have been some heckling or some verbal comments made to different groups, but never anything to this particular level. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNGKtFA5zk&t=121.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sure it's hard to imagine really anything like this happening to your group. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNGKtFA5zk&t=133.0s)]
*  Is there anything you do as an organization to prepare for potential acts of violence? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNGKtFA5zk&t=138.0s)]
*  We always tell our group leaders that safety is our utmost concern and responsibility. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNGKtFA5zk&t=143.0s)]
*  So some of our groups do have police escort that do walk with them regularly. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNGKtFA5zk&t=151.0s)]
*  Some of them have private security. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNGKtFA5zk&t=156.0s)]
*  But again, we really lean on our local leaders to determine whether or not there's a need for security, depending on what's happening in their community. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNGKtFA5zk&t=159.0s)]
*  We've never really had to have any security concerns to this regard. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNGKtFA5zk&t=167.0s)]
*  Moving forward into next week, we again are leaning on our community leaders and asking them to determine what is the best course of action moving forward. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNGKtFA5zk&t=173.0s)]
*  Do you know what kind of security presence was there on scene for this particular event? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNGKtFA5zk&t=184.0s)]
*  I know that the local police authority was informed. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNGKtFA5zk&t=190.0s)]
*  They're informed every week when they go out for a walk just to let them know that it's happening. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNGKtFA5zk&t=193.0s)]
*  But that's the extent of it. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNGKtFA5zk&t=199.0s)]
*  At this point, do you feel like you can continue to hold these types of demonstrations? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNGKtFA5zk&t=201.0s)]
*  Does this change your plans at all moving forward? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNGKtFA5zk&t=206.0s)]
*  Not for me personally, no. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNGKtFA5zk&t=210.0s)]
*  I lead my own walk in my own community. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNGKtFA5zk&t=212.0s)]
*  But again, it's hard to, you know, people are going to react to this differently and they need the space and the time to react to it. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNGKtFA5zk&t=215.0s)]
*  So we don't want to put that onus on anybody but the leaders of the different groups. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNGKtFA5zk&t=223.0s)]
*  Myself personally, no, it's not going to deter me. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNGKtFA5zk&t=229.0s)]
*  But again, it depends on the local leaders in the community and how safe they feel. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNGKtFA5zk&t=232.0s)]
*  And I'm sure everybody's still processing what has happened. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNGKtFA5zk&t=236.0s)]
*  Shira Weiss, thank you very much for taking the time. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNGKtFA5zk&t=239.0s)]
*  We wish you and all of your team members the very, very best. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNGKtFA5zk&t=242.0s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNGKtFA5zk&t=246.0s)]
