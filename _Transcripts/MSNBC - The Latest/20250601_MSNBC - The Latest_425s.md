# Inside the fight against the Oklahoma’s plan to push Trump's big election lie in schools
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA)
*  Next year, Oklahoma high school students will have conspiracy theories about the 2020 election [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=0.0s)]
*  added to their social studies curricula. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=6.24s)]
*  Yes, you heard that right. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=9.08s)]
*  In a section on President Trump's first term, students will be asked to, quote, identify [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=11.88s)]
*  discrepancies in 2020 election's results by looking at graphs and other information, including [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=16.76s)]
*  the sudden halting of ballot counting in select cities and key battleground states, the security [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=23.46s)]
*  risks of mail in balloting, sudden batch dumps, an unforeseen record number of voters and [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=29.16s)]
*  the unprecedented contradiction of Bellwether County trends. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=36.56s)]
*  I was quoting there to be clear, there is absolutely no evidence of any significant [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  discrepancies or voter fraud in the 2020 election. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=48.68s)]
*  A group of parents and teachers has already filed a lawsuit asking a judge to nullify [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=52.84s)]
*  the curriculum. And some parents are writing letters to opt their children out of the, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=57.88s)]
*  quote, ideologically charged social studies lessons. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=62.92s)]
*  Joining us now, someone leading that charge, Erica Watkins, director of We're Oklahoma [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=67.52000000000001s)]
*  Education. Miss Watkins, thank you very much for coming to the weekend. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=72.68s)]
*  So have you heard anything in response to the opt out letters? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=77.08s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=82.4s)]
*  Yes, I have. Parents have been really excited. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=83.80000000000001s)]
*  And people are wanting to make sure that their students aren't included in some of this [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=86.64s)]
*  ideal, ideologically charged curriculum. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=91.76s)]
*  As far as the State Department of Education, Ryan Walters has called us every name in the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  book. He's not excited about parents using their rights to opt out of this curriculum, but we [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=99.88s)]
*  are going to do just that. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=105.04s)]
*  And how much support is there actually for this curriculum? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=106.8s)]
*  There's there's not a lot. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=112.28s)]
*  This curriculum had a lot of public pushback. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=114.24s)]
*  The election conspiracy claims were actually added after public comment was closed and kind of [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=117.0s)]
*  snuck in where some new board members weren't even aware of this. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=122.64s)]
*  So there's been a lot of public pushback, but they are just pushing it through anyway, because [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=127.0s)]
*  it's just part of a larger plan by the people that wrote this curriculum. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=130.68s)]
*  Erica, we want to put up just kind of a collage of headlines of what the superintendent of Oklahoma [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=135.4s)]
*  education wants to put in. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=142.28s)]
*  So Bibles that Oklahoma wants for the schools match a version backed by Trump. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=144.08s)]
*  Then the top educator requires schools to play a video of him praying for Trump. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=151.08s)]
*  And yeah, that's kind of some of the grab bag of what you got there. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=157.60000000000002s)]
*  What about I don't know, what about the argument separation of church and state? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=164.24s)]
*  I you know, that isn't coming to play at all here. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=169.28s)]
*  I mean, that's that it does. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  But these these people actually argue that there is no separation of church and state. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=174.32000000000002s)]
*  Ryan Walters himself has said that that's not a thing that the founders did not believe [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  that, which is blatantly false. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=182.76000000000002s)]
*  But our opt out film do actually include all of the PragerU curriculum, the videos that [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=185.12s)]
*  he was mandating and the Bible lessons as well as these harmful things that are in these [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=192.28s)]
*  social studies standards. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=196.96s)]
*  Miss Watkins, I would like to point out that really quickly that Oklahoma is 49th in the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=198.52s)]
*  nation in education PK through 12, which feels like there's other things that the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=204.8s)]
*  superintendent here could be focusing on. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=211.12s)]
*  I want to zoom out a little bit because my question to you is, what do you think is [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=213.6s)]
*  behind this kind of politicization of education? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=219.16s)]
*  What are they really trying to do here? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=221.96s)]
*  Well, I mean, the end goal is to privatize education. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=224.8s)]
*  We are seeing a coordinated attempt or attempt to attack all of the institutions across the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=227.8s)]
*  United States and by privatizing and putting ideologically and religious based content in [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=232.88s)]
*  public schools, they're using that as a weapon to get political control of the schools, the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=239.24s)]
*  education, the curriculum and generations to come. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=245.12s)]
*  So this is part of a nationwide effort to undermine democracy and put forth their ideology [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=248.08s)]
*  as if it is fact. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=255.16000000000003s)]
*  And Oklahoma is just the testing ground for things like Project 2025. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=257.04s)]
*  The superintendent, Ryan Walters, has said to the AP, the standards do not instruct students [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=261.68s)]
*  on what to believe rather than encourage critical thinking by inviting students to examine [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=268.12s)]
*  real events, review publicly available information and come to their own conclusions, which is [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=273.16s)]
*  not how I was taught. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=278.92s)]
*  He has also said the new curriculum will allow students to think for themselves and not be [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=280.56s)]
*  spoon fed left wing propaganda. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=285.0s)]
*  Do you think that's what this curriculum is going to do for students? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=287.72s)]
*  I mean, this is saying that we're going to treat conspiracy theories as the same thing as [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=292.84000000000003s)]
*  objective fact and weigh the difference. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=299.04s)]
*  And that's that's not what it is. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=301.16s)]
*  There is no leftist indoctrination in Oklahoma public schools. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=303.40000000000003s)]
*  What Ryan Walters wants is white Christian nationalist rhetoric in in the schools. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=308.52000000000004s)]
*  And that is exactly what they're trying to do. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=315.16s)]
*  Well, Miss Watkins, I'm glad you pointed out because, you know, a lot of conservatives or [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=317.76s)]
*  far right folks are really good at projection when they rail against indoctrination and [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=323.76s)]
*  their solutions to it is indoctrinating indoctrinating people and in this case, children [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=329.92s)]
*  to their far right views or as I think you accurately said, white Christian nationalist [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=336.96s)]
*  views. Why push back on their indoctrination claims? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=343.8s)]
*  Well, I mean, these social studies standards added an extra 40 references to the Bible. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=348.64000000000004s)]
*  And we're talking hyper specific biblical lessons and how they influenced America. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=354.6s)]
*  We have been accused of leftist indoctrination because we came up with these forms, but we are [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=360.52000000000004s)]
*  not introducing curriculum into the classrooms that has anything we we want to make sure that [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=366.0s)]
*  Oklahoma is not all Christian. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=372.68s)]
*  We are not all white. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=374.64000000000004s)]
*  We are not all white. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=376.04s)]
*  We have people from different cultural backgrounds, different sexualities, different gender [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=377.28000000000003s)]
*  identities, and we're all Oklahomans. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=382.44s)]
*  Ryan Walters thinks that anything that isn't his very specific brand of Christianity is [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=385.0s)]
*  indoctrination. And that's not true. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=391.44s)]
*  Erica Watkins, thank you so much for coming on and we'll be watching as this kind of [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=393.88s)]
*  unfolds and I see your earrings. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=397.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, the folding chair. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  She said, take a seat. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQvUuY0gtA&t=400.76s)]
