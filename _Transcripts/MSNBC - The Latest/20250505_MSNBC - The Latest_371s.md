# 'Hook up team Trump?' Trump's sons' business deals directly benefit president, NYT reports
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc)
*  Tonight, new reporting from the New York Times about the extent of Eric Trump and Donald [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump Jr.'s recent business deals, many that directly benefit the president himself. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=5.16s)]
*  Quote, President Trump's two older sons have pursued a blitz of family money-making ventures, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=10.68s)]
*  capitalizing on their father's name and power, each seemingly trying to outdo the other. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=16.2s)]
*  The Times lists some of the deals that include the following. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=21.28s)]
*  A luxury hotel in Dubai. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=24.2s)]
*  A second high-end residential tower in Saudi Arabia. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=26.04s)]
*  Two cryptocurrency ventures based in the United States. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=29.4s)]
*  A new golf course and villa complex in Qatar. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=32.44s)]
*  And a new private social club in Washington, D.C. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=35.32s)]
*  Here now to discuss Natasha Cern, former Treasury official and Yale Law professor, and Bharat [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  Ramamurthy, former National Economic Council Deputy Director. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=44.0s)]
*  Natasha, the White House says there is no conflict of interest. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=47.36s)]
*  But the Times notes that his financial disclosure report shows that he still benefits financially. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=51.379999999999995s)]
*  Why is it that there's no conflict of interest? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=58.56s)]
*  So ultimately, and I think you heard Susan talk about this on the last panel, there's [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=62.400000000000006s)]
*  obviously an incredibly important role for Congress to play here with respect to oversight. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=66.48s)]
*  Because questions about conflicts of interests are ones where there needs to be the capacity [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=71.64s)]
*  to evaluate the nature of the conflict. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=76.36s)]
*  And also, it's not just a matter of like particular financial dealings in particular areas. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=79.2s)]
*  These are really core issues to our democracy that need to be navigated. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=84.62s)]
*  But that's sort of like, I get it, but let's go like brass tacks here. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=88.68s)]
*  Why the hell is Donald Trump allowed to do this? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=94.08s)]
*  So I think that the thing that we, you know, I get why these are like incredibly interesting [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=96.48s)]
*  and incredibly compelling stories. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=102.06s)]
*  And ultimately, like the President's sons, these are like the nature of the journalistic [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=104.62s)]
*  discussion about them is like an important one. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=110.76s)]
*  And it's one that it's important for journalists to dig into. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  And it's one that's important for Congress to dig into. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=116.4s)]
*  As an economist, I have to say, as I'm watching all of this unfold, I think there is a lot [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  to be said about thinking about these two particular children. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=122.84s)]
*  But there's also a lot to be said about the ways in which this administration's policies [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=126.48s)]
*  are impacting all of our children. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=130.6s)]
*  And I think there, there's a really important story to be told, not just about particular [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=132.82s)]
*  conflicts of interest, which are obviously super important, Stephanie, but also about [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=137.32s)]
*  the ways in which these policies that are being pursued are having really important [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=141.32s)]
*  and negative impacts on our economy. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=145.95999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, Barat, these deals involve foreign government leaders. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=148.6s)]
*  And Donald Trump Jr. has met with other countries leaders. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=153.6s)]
*  Like aren't we bearing the headlines? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=157.51999999999998s)]
*  Like we could be engaging in deals with foreign countries that do not benefit the United States [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=159.2s)]
*  of America, but they certainly hook up Team Trump. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=164.68s)]
*  Yeah, to me, that's the bottom line here, which is that in each of these cases that [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=168.32s)]
*  you've highlighted, what seems to be happening is that the Trump family is using the economic [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=174.0s)]
*  and even military prowess of the United States to help secure gains for themselves rather [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=180.14s)]
*  than gains for the American people. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=186.68s)]
*  And all of these different dealings with the governments of Qatar and the UAE and so on [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=188.12s)]
*  and so forth, you could think about it as those are all opportunities where the administration [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=192.64s)]
*  could be doing something to secure something good for the American people. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=197.44s)]
*  Instead, what they're trying to do is secure something good for themselves. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=200.11999999999998s)]
*  And I think that there's harm to the American people from that in the short term. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=203.11999999999998s)]
*  But I also think that there's a longer term harm here, which is that, as you well know, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=206.27999999999997s)]
*  there are a lot of countries in the world where the standard operating procedure is [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=210.48s)]
*  if I want to do business there, I got to figure out who to bribe and how much. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=214.11999999999998s)]
*  And that kind of corruption really eats away at the rule of law, democracy, and it scares [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=217.76s)]
*  away investment over the long term. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=224.28s)]
*  My fear for the United States is that even beyond the corruption and the harm that it's [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=226.0s)]
*  causing right now, it's going to deter people from wanting to invest in the United States. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=230.0s)]
*  And ultimately, that's a key driver for growth, for jobs, for higher wages and so on. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=234.35999999999999s)]
*  If people do not trust our rule of law, they are not going to invest in our companies and [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=238.84s)]
*  they're certainly not going to buy the U.S. dollar. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=242.48s)]
*  So, Parat, I want to talk crypto for a moment because this goes back to unregulated crypto [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=245.4s)]
*  could have devastating impacts for the American people. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=251.20000000000002s)]
*  And of course, it was mentioned in the last segment, the president hosting a crypto-focused [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=255.24s)]
*  fundraiser, 1.5 million bucks ahead. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=259.44s)]
*  Then later in May, he's going to a dinner at Trump National in D.C. where entry is based [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=263.24s)]
*  on top holders of his meme coin that includes a VIP White House tour. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=268.6s)]
*  Like for real, during the Biden administration, and I'm not putting it on you because Congress [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=273.48s)]
*  has to set these rules, one of the arguments was we're going to close loopholes so a president [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=278.68s)]
*  cannot behave this way again. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=284.6s)]
*  Why is any of this allowed? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=287.08000000000004s)]
*  I think that it's highly questionable. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=291.68s)]
*  I think the real concern is that because Trump controls the various arms of the government, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=293.8s)]
*  you're seeing how they can interlock with each other. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=299.38s)]
*  So in other words, you had a crypto millionaire who was under indictment and was found guilty, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=301.04s)]
*  and he put $75 million into various Trump meme coin related issues. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=309.12s)]
*  And he got a pardon from the president of the United States. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=315.6s)]
*  Now he's investing in this new meme coin and putting money directly into the president's [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=317.6s)]
*  pocket. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=321.04s)]
*  You have senior folks at the White House, you have the head of the SEC who have taken [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=322.24s)]
*  a very hands off approach to enforcing rules around cryptocurrency. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=326.2s)]
*  And ultimately, the people who are going to get hurt by this are not the millionaires [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=330.15999999999997s)]
*  and billionaires who can throw $20 million into this as a way of putting money into Trump's [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=334.64s)]
*  pocket. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=338.76s)]
*  It's regular retail folks who want to buy a little bit of this because they've heard [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=339.76s)]
*  that it's an interesting new investment, and they're going to be left holding the bag when [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=343.32s)]
*  all of this ends up crumbling down because there isn't anything of value behind it. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw8H-x6yOoc&t=347.32s)]
