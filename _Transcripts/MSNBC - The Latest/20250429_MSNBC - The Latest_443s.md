# 'Chaos’ of tariffs leading to ‘great deal of uncertainty’ in auto industry: Michigan lawmaker
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4)
*  I want to bring in Michigan Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Dingell. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=0.0s)]
*  It's good to see you. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=3.84s)]
*  And look, I know you've been holding plenty of town halls. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=4.84s)]
*  You're listening to voters. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=6.96s)]
*  We know people are angry. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=8.68s)]
*  Some are scared. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=10.6s)]
*  I know that they are also coming to you. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=11.68s)]
*  So what have you learned? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=15.32s)]
*  What do they want you to do about it? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=16.76s)]
*  And is the Democratic Party doing it? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=18.6s)]
*  So I think it's a really complicated time. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=22.32s)]
*  I think people are worried. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=25.2s)]
*  You know, tariffs have mixed feelings in Michigan. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=27.599999999999998s)]
*  I discuss it with my colleagues. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=31.68s)]
*  I have had UAW voters who have come to regular forums that I do in town halls and yell at [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  me the only way to bring the jobs home that they have lost is the way that he is doing [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=39.84s)]
*  it. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  And I've been in other union halls where people are worried about what's going to happen to [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  the increased costs. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=50.4s)]
*  There are layoffs in the industry. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=51.8s)]
*  There are just a lot of people that don't know how to feel. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=54.6s)]
*  And the auto industry doesn't want to be a ping pong ball, period. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=57.0s)]
*  They're not going to speak up. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=60.4s)]
*  They're not going to speak out. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=61.48s)]
*  They want the certainty for their companies. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=62.96s)]
*  And it's just been kind of chaotic. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=66.0s)]
*  So people come and say to these town halls, what are you going to do about it? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=68.0s)]
*  What are you going to do? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=72.75999999999999s)]
*  When are Democrats going to fight? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  And I know you're going to see people there today that are going to be very strongly supporting [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=75.68s)]
*  the president. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=80.6s)]
*  I hear it and get it all. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=81.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=83.8s)]
*  So that leaves us here. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=84.8s)]
*  The auto industry, your state's bloodline, right? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  Today the president will talk tonight, I guess as well. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=89.08s)]
*  The White House announcing a new executive order to keep auto tariffs in place. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=92.91999999999999s)]
*  But they say that automakers will not have to pay tariffs on metals as well as on cars [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=97.46s)]
*  and car parts. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=102.52s)]
*  There's also word that they would be reimbursed for some of the tariffs, although it's not [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  clear how that would work. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=107.6s)]
*  Does this move by the White House help people in Michigan? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=109.8s)]
*  What's your reaction to what you know? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=113.44s)]
*  I'm going to tell you that tariffs are a tool in the toolbox. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=116.36s)]
*  They are most appropriate when we're using them against a country like China, which is [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=120.32s)]
*  subsidizing the manufacturing of the products, manipulating their currency using slave labor. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=124.64s)]
*  The chaos that has been imposed this year that has seen the stock market go crazy has [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=131.16s)]
*  led to total uncertainty isn't helping. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=137.84s)]
*  And I'm one of those people that thinks Canada is our friend. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=140.24s)]
*  We should not be treating them the way that we are. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=143.88s)]
*  I told you Donald Trump would be elected in 2016. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=146.48000000000002s)]
*  I told you it was the trade issue. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=149.60000000000002s)]
*  I was right then. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=151.28s)]
*  It's got to be done the right way. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=152.88s)]
*  But the way it's being done right now is just creating a great deal of uncertainty, which [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=154.28s)]
*  isn't helping the industry. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=159.48000000000002s)]
*  I know this is just coming out, but do you have some level of certainty about what these [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=160.96s)]
*  that apparently the president is proposing would do? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=167.51999999999998s)]
*  Look, I'm going to tell you what part of the problem is. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=171.0s)]
*  You don't know what it's going to be day to day. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=174.04s)]
*  The last time he made the audit of Terrace and Mountain three weeks ago, I talked to [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=177.07999999999998s)]
*  multiple lawyers for different companies, different unions, and people were still trying [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=181.48s)]
*  to interpret it to get a process for by which way something was USMCA compliant, not compliant. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=186.32s)]
*  Let's see what he says. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=194.2s)]
*  Then let's keep it in place so people can actually make plans. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=195.72s)]
*  You can't change the production of a plant overnight. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  You have to have long term planning. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=203.0s)]
*  Suppliers built plants thinking they were compliant with USMCA and Mexico because they [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=204.72s)]
*  were told by the car companies to build there. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  And now they've made investments. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=213.60000000000002s)]
*  I don't want them in Mexico. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=215.16s)]
*  I want them back home in the United States. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=216.44s)]
*  But we need a plan that is consistent and explainable and not chaotic. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=218.72s)]
*  What we hear consistently from Republicans, though, and I don't need to tell you this, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=225.24s)]
*  is that Democrats don't have a plan. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=229.04000000000002s)]
*  And I want to get your reaction to what House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said about Democrats [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=231.56s)]
*  today. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=236.24s)]
*  They are void of any ideas. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=237.24s)]
*  They are a leaderless party. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=240.44s)]
*  The Democrat party literally has no leader except AOC and Crockett and Bernie Sanders. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  And that's what their parties become. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=248.32000000000002s)]
*  They're just opposed to everything. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=249.76000000000002s)]
*  If you're going to win back a state like Michigan, it's going to be because you won back working [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=252.24s)]
*  class voters, right? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=256.84s)]
*  I'm from Ohio. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=257.84s)]
*  Same thing. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=258.84s)]
*  Do you think the party has settled on the right messages and has the right messengers? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=260.88s)]
*  So I consider myself to be a leader. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=267.08s)]
*  I consider Governor Gretchen Whitmer to be a leader. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=269.28s)]
*  We are going into those union halls. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=272.4s)]
*  I am there on a regular basis. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=274.48s)]
*  I have warned my party leaders. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=276.56s)]
*  I think that the Democratic party has always been inclusive. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=278.8s)]
*  It's been a big tent. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=282.44s)]
*  We can't have circular firing squads, but we need to stay focused on the economy. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=283.56s)]
*  And Donald Trump has created more uncertainty. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=288.12s)]
*  People are worried about their jobs in Michigan because of the tariffs. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=291.48s)]
*  They're paying more money. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=295.36s)]
*  Their stock portfolios have gone down. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=297.15999999999997s)]
*  Seniors are worried about their retirement. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=299.52s)]
*  And no, I don't think they feel themselves better off economically. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=301.92s)]
*  Economically, and our job, and we must, is to talk about the economy, how we're going [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=305.08s)]
*  to bring jobs home, do a better job at trade policy, make jobs secure. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=310.68s)]
*  And we need to have an industrial policy plan, which I've been working really hard on, of [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=317.08s)]
*  how we're going to have manufacturing, economic security, and national security protected [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=322.96s)]
*  all at the same time. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=327.36s)]
*  And we need to bring pharmaceutical, we're talking autos, we need to bring pharmaceutical [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=328.91999999999996s)]
*  production back here now, too. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=333.76s)]
*  Too much of our medicine's made overseas. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=335.84s)]
*  So let me ask you about another approach to this, or maybe it's an auxiliary approach, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=338.84s)]
*  but it's an approach nevertheless. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=342.59999999999997s)]
*  This week, one of your Michigan colleagues introduced a resolution to impeach President [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=344.12s)]
*  Trump. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=348.4s)]
*  But of course, you know this, it's likely to be referred to the Republican-run Judiciary [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=349.4s)]
*  Committee. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=352.76s)]
*  It's not going to go anywhere. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=353.76s)]
*  Is that part of the problem you think voters see, that moves are made for show that can't [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=355.52s)]
*  concede, and what they don't see is action that can make a difference? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=361.36s)]
*  Or is that just the reality of a party in the minority? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=365.28000000000003s)]
*  So I'm going to be very blunt that we have to do a better job of making sure people are [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=370.4s)]
*  seeing what we are doing. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=374.88s)]
*  I don't agree with my colleague on what he did. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=377.96s)]
*  I think it's a distraction. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=381.84000000000003s)]
*  I think we need to be focused on issues that people talk about at the kitchen table every [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=384.72s)]
*  night and show them what they're doing. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=389.2s)]
*  I think this next month we're going to be very focused on protecting people's health [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=391.4s)]
*  care, making sure that we keep rural hospitals still operating, that our children and our [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=395.28000000000003s)]
*  seniors are going to have access to the health care they need, be taken care of in their [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=400.76s)]
*  retirement. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=405.72s)]
*  That's what we need to be focused on in delivering. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=406.72s)]
*  And Republicans are not going to be able to cut $880 billion out of their budget that [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=409.16s)]
*  they passed and we voted for and not hurt America's health care. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYeU-rtfe4&t=415.72s)]
