# 'We have to throw every resource at this problem': NJ lawmaker reacts to Newark Airport chaos
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg)
*  For more now, we are joined by Democratic Congressman Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=0.0s)]
*  Congressman, thank you for being with us. Newark is your local airport. What is your reaction to [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=4.48s)]
*  Sam's report? Do you feel safe flying in and out of there? I mean, I've got multiple concerns all [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=9.68s)]
*  going on at once as you're hearing, right? You've got a huge shortage of air traffic controllers who [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  are overworked as it is. And I've been up in that tower. They're using massively outdated technology. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=21.84s)]
*  We're about in the region, 40 air traffic controllers short of where we should be. So you [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=27.04s)]
*  don't have enough people to staff the towers, which is obviously causing three hour delays or [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  more on its own. Right? Then you add the technology, which is literally from the 60s, you got copper [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=36.0s)]
*  wire, which is why that, as you reported a few minutes ago, you had a 90 second outage where [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=42.16s)]
*  there was no coverage in the tower, right? No audio, no radar, because there was a burn on one [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  of the copper wires, right? Which is crazy when you think about where we are and how advanced we [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=54.64s)]
*  are in technology as a country, that this is what we're relying on. So you've got technology issues [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=58.88s)]
*  will take some time, but the immediate demand I have is to the FAA on staffing. We've got to get [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=62.72s)]
*  to the, to the department of transportation. You got to get more people into the tower immediately. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=68.24s)]
*  You got to move shift around resources and we've got to get more people there so it's safe for [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=72.8s)]
*  everybody and we can handle the capacity at one of the busiest airports in the country, an artery [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=78.56s)]
*  of the economy of our country here in New Jersey. You just outlined all of the problems that are [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=83.12s)]
*  now kind of coming together in this very, very disturbing and consequential moment when it comes [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=88.4s)]
*  to air safety. We just heard from the transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, a little clip in Sam's piece, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  but here he is last night. This was on Fox news talking more about what happened on Monday and [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=101.2s)]
*  what's at play here, the problem. So the primary communication line went down. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=107.76s)]
*  The backup line didn't fire and so for 30 seconds we lost contact with air traffic. That's a big [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=115.12s)]
*  problem. It is. Now we're planes going to crash. No, they have communication devices. They can see [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  other air traffic like GPS in the airplanes, but it's a sign that we have a frail system in place [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  and it has to be fixed. The secretary calling the system frail, kind of brushing off that there was [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=133.44s)]
*  actual risk of any airplanes crashing, colliding, but how did it get to this point and what do you [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=139.84s)]
*  think is needed to fix it? Well clearly it's unacceptable calling our system in the greatest [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=146.8s)]
*  country in the world frail, right, and it gets to the point when you don't have enough FAA workers. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=152.0s)]
*  I mean obviously you know the Trump administration actually laid off a bunch of FAA workers as soon [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=157.12s)]
*  as they got in, which didn't help and I called on them to immediately reverse course, but this is [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=161.2s)]
*  not a problem that came up overnight. We've known for years that these towers have outdated technology. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=166.88s)]
*  If you go up there you literally see them handing little pieces of paper off to each other. That's [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=172.0s)]
*  how the system still works. It doesn't sound like a quick fix. Well that part is going to take time. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=175.67999999999998s)]
*  The getting more air traffic controllers also takes time to train, but we should move our resources [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  around, especially focused on Newark when the CEO of United Airlines is telling people don't fly [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=187.20000000000002s)]
*  to Newark because we don't have the capacity and literally this is one of the busiest airspaces in [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  the world and our whole economy, 20 percent of our nation's economy, is running through this region. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=197.44s)]
*  The answer is not well it just is what it is. You're going to have to move resources around. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=202.4s)]
*  We're going to have to speed along the upgrades that the secretary is talking about. We can't [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=206.24s)]
*  continue to punt, as has often been the case with some of these investments. We got it. We got to [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=210.16s)]
*  do both, but for now let me just tell you, we can't just sit back and say it is what it is [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=214.8s)]
*  and just accept it. We got to throw every resource at this problem and nothing else should be [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=220.4s)]
*  acceptable in my opinion, especially here at one of our airports. I understand too why you want to [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=225.44s)]
*  focus on Newark airport, but we know that there are problems really around the country. With the [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  New York Times reporting earlier this year, 90 percent of the country's air traffic control [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=236.16s)]
*  facilities are understaffed, so there aren't necessarily resources to just move around. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=240.24s)]
*  Secretary Duffy has promised to supercharge hiring. He has a plan that will include increasing [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=246.08s)]
*  salaries for people admitted into the controller academy, bonuses for fresh graduates and those [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=252.56s)]
*  who go to harder to fill locations. He's offering incentives to controllers nearing retirement to [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=258.64s)]
*  try to keep them on longer. What do you make of that plan? Well I think many of us have been [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=264.08s)]
*  calling that for years because we know we've had a shortage for years. You got to train more, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=269.2s)]
*  but also when you're short staffed, you know what happens? They're burning people out faster. People [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=274.08s)]
*  are working multiple back-to-back shifts, which is not as a very intense job and I've met with [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=278.24s)]
*  many of them and they work incredibly hard. It's a very seriously focused job. We got to make sure [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=284.24s)]
*  not only we take care of them and pay them right, but also that we recruit more and we do a better [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=288.96s)]
*  job going out there and recruiting. We've got to do both and we've got to speed that along and not [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=293.91999999999996s)]
*  treat these folks like right they're just that we don't treat them the best as we should and [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=298.72s)]
*  that's what's happening right now. We're not treating them the best they should be treated [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=303.52000000000004s)]
*  and so my opinion is go get you know go aggressively hire, reward those that we have, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=306.24s)]
*  take care of them and also make sure we look at the map system of where our people are allocated [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=311.84000000000003s)]
*  around you know where these resources are allocated around the country. There are places I believe [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=316.88000000000005s)]
*  where we can move more for New York, for Newark, for the airports in the region where we have a [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=320.64000000000004s)]
*  short staffing. We've got to get Newark up and running. It can't be that one of the busiest arteries [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=326.08s)]
*  is sidelined right now and people are waiting hours. That's unacceptable and of course let's [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=331.52s)]
*  bring in everybody. We're a great country on the technology front. Let's see how fast we can do [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=335.52s)]
*  some of these fixes. We can't just say well it is what it is. It's copper wire. Oh it just happens. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=339.91999999999996s)]
*  We can't fix this. That's not acceptable. We got to fix this. We got to do it now. The secretary [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=344.47999999999996s)]
*  obviously taking steps, but we got to go fast here. You're describing an emergency all hands on deck [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=348.79999999999995s)]
*  kind of situation. This is an emergency. Gotta go fast. Congressman Josh Gottheimer, thank you [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=353.52s)]
*  very much for time. Thanks for having me. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDALP2GWmqg&t=358.4s)]
