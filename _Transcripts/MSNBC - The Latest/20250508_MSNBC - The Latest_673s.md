# ‘Enormous soft power index’: Why new Pope Leo XIV is a ‘contrast’ to President Trump
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8)
*  Back to our special coverage of the brand new pope, an American, Pope Leo XIV. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=0.0s)]
*  Joining me now, former Undersecretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs, Richard Stengel, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=4.8s)]
*  and former Republican Ohio Governor John Kasich, both our MSNBC political analyst. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  I still have Chris Jansing with me. Chris, before we talk about the politics, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=13.6s)]
*  I want to ask you about the pathway for an American to become pope. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=17.2s)]
*  Every single person I talked to about Cardinal Prevost said, this, this, this, all great things, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=23.599999999999998s)]
*  but he's an American. There wasn't a single person who didn't think that being an American [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=31.52s)]
*  kept him out of it for decades. It was just accepted an American would not be pope. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=37.04s)]
*  Look, you can look at his credentials. One of your guests said this, you know, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=41.68s)]
*  he, missionary, evangelization, very important. He's had curial positions that allowed him to [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=44.72s)]
*  meet with a lot of the Cardinals. He's a polyglot. He can speak to people in a lot of languages, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=51.2s)]
*  but there's two things that haven't been talked about that I want to point out that were part of [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=55.760000000000005s)]
*  his path. I'm sure one is the line you've heard a bunch this week. If you go into the conclave, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  a pope, you leave a Cardinal. He did not do that. He has always laid low. He's naturally not flashy. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=67.12s)]
*  He doesn't give a lot of interviews. He never sought the limelight. And I think for a lot of [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=75.36s)]
*  people who felt maybe that Pope Francis spent a little too much time out there taking the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=80.88s)]
*  accolades, they wanted someone who was going to focus more on the core mission of the church. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=88.32000000000001s)]
*  Number one. And I think the second thing is he's an Augustinian and Augustinians take a vow of [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=92.32s)]
*  obedience. And so throughout his career, when he has been asked to do things, will you go to Peru? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=97.28s)]
*  When this pope, Pope Francis, said to him, I think I might appoint you to the head of the Dicastery [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=104.48s)]
*  for bishops, he said to him, I will do what you believe the church needs and what I am called to [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=111.2s)]
*  do. One of the fascinating things that I would love to know is when he went into the room of tears, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  because men have gone in there and thought, what am I getting myself into? Not very many, but a few. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  And they cried. And a number of them we know have cried. We know Pope Benedict was waiting to go. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=130.16s)]
*  He just bought a house with his brother and was going to go retire. And he famously retired from [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=137.12s)]
*  the papacy. Famously did retire. That he is somebody who is obedient. And there was a famous story [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  about a wise older priest who said to him, in your younger years, it's going to be the vow of [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=149.28s)]
*  celibacy that's difficult. In your later years, it's the vow of obedience. And that obedience calls [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=155.04s)]
*  him to live the life of the missionary of spreading the word. It's a hard thing to be pope. Oh my gosh, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=161.84s)]
*  can you imagine? One of the people I talked to at the funeral came out and she said, I'm praying. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=168.48s)]
*  When she went to see Lying in State of Pope Francis, she said, I prayed for the new pope. I don't [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=173.28s)]
*  know why anyone would want to take this on. Let me read from Crooks now about the idea of [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=178.56s)]
*  becoming an American pope. I think this is interesting. Once upon a time, it was said that [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=184.8s)]
*  the idea of an American pope was unthinkable. In the beginning, it was for basically logistical [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=189.44s)]
*  reasons. Steamships from the New World took so long to reach Rome that American cardinals often [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=193.68s)]
*  arrived too late to vote. And in any event, they were never part of the political sausage grinding [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=199.12s)]
*  before the conclave began. Later, the veto on an American pope became geopolitical. You couldn't [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=204.24s)]
*  have a superpower pope, or so the thinking ran, because too many people around the world would [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=211.12s)]
*  wonder if papal decisions were really being crafted in the Vatican or at the CIA headquarters in [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=215.76s)]
*  Langley. Today, however, that logic feels superannuated. It's a flip from the criticism [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=221.84s)]
*  of JFK. Is he going to take orders from the pope instead of the American people? Governor Kasich, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=227.6s)]
*  I want to ask you this. Does an American pope make Catholicism more relevant in America? Does [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=233.36s)]
*  it make it more relevant in American politics even? Well, first of all, I think you ladies have done [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=242.32000000000002s)]
*  a fantastic job. I've been watching you all day off and on. And Chris was there when it actually [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=247.76000000000002s)]
*  happened. Congratulations. She did fantastic. Look, I think what's happened here is it seems [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=253.52s)]
*  as though, no, I haven't talked to everybody, but everybody that I sense is happy. They're really [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=261.12s)]
*  pleased about the fact that he was picked not because he was an American, but he was picked [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=266.8s)]
*  because of his concern for the poor, his concern for the downtrodden, and a sort of a continuation [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=271.76s)]
*  of Francis without him being Francis. And we should make no mistake about it. Francis was able to [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=280.16s)]
*  put him into certain positions that allowed him to be in a position of being able to be selected [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=286.56s)]
*  pope. And so I think what you have here is somebody who can maybe pull both sides together [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=292.4s)]
*  and somebody that's going to speak with a kind heart. And I believe we not only need this in [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=297.76s)]
*  America, but we need this worldwide to remember the love of Jesus and the love of our father. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=303.2s)]
*  And I think that that becomes more and more attractive. And I guarantee you tonight, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=309.52s)]
*  there are people who have never paid attention to this who are saying, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=313.84s)]
*  wonder what this whole pope thing is all about. And maybe this is pretty good. So I'm thrilled [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=318.08s)]
*  with it. I'm happy about it. I think it's a great step forward. But I'm less concerned that he's an [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=324.71999999999997s)]
*  American as opposed to the way he looks at the world and the way he looks at people. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=331.35999999999996s)]
*  Politically speaking, he's going to be pretty relevant here and already is so. We have been [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=337.91999999999996s)]
*  able to find his Twitter feed. He's either tweeting himself or retweeting about American [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=342.48s)]
*  politics, criticizing this president's stance on immigration, criticizing recently the Oval Office [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=348.08000000000004s)]
*  meeting between him and the president of El Salvador. He's criticized child separations. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=354.64000000000004s)]
*  He's criticized the rampant gun problem we have in this country. He's criticized racism. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=359.52000000000004s)]
*  MAGA has gotten ahold of it as well. And some loud voices within the MAGA universe are angry [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=367.12s)]
*  about his selection as pope. They see it as, I don't want to say an act of war that's too strong, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=372.8s)]
*  but they see it as a rebuke of the president and not in a kind way. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=378.72s)]
*  Donald Trump very famously in 2016 went after Pope Francis and criticized him on the campaign [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=385.12s)]
*  trial. And that was just one of the many people that he criticized that no one would ever have [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=393.28s)]
*  dared to do before. Do you foresee this having legs in the American political landscape? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=401.84s)]
*  Yeah, you summarized it well. I mean, it may indeed be a rebuke of some of those conservative [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=411.44s)]
*  ideas. I don't know that the cardinals are thinking about American politics as much as we are, but [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=418.32s)]
*  he's a different kind of American. I mean, he's thinking about American policy, if not politics. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=424.48s)]
*  Yeah, no, I think he's been righteous about that. It reminds me that Joe Nye died this week. Joe [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=429.36s)]
*  Nye was the great Harvard political philosopher who came up with the idea of soft power, soft [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=437.12s)]
*  power as opposed to hard military power, power of culture, the power of influence. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=442.64s)]
*  This has an enormous soft power index for America in a positive way, as Governor Kasich said. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=447.36s)]
*  He's a different kind of American. He represents values that are different than the values on the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=454.96s)]
*  world stage of the MAGA Trump administration, concern for the poor, concern for immigrants, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=460.47999999999996s)]
*  all of the things that Francis talked about. I think it's a boon to the idea that Americans [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=467.12s)]
*  don't have to be this kind of autocratic model that we're seeing with the Trump administration. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=472.4s)]
*  He's lived an integrated life. I mean, he's lived in many other places. He speaks multiple languages. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=478.4s)]
*  He's an American who has not isolated himself in America. He's not a nationalist. In fact, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=483.28000000000003s)]
*  when he was rebuking J.D. Vance, he was rebuking the idea that Vance put forward, which is that [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=489.28000000000003s)]
*  in the Christian faith, you love yourself first, your family next, your community after that, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=494.47999999999996s)]
*  and then everybody else. The rebuke from Pope Leo XIV before he became pope was no. Jesus did not [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=499.59999999999997s)]
*  say that there's an order to your love. This is a man who has been global as America in this moment [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=507.52s)]
*  is becoming much more insular. Yes, as Jesus said, who is my neighbor? That was the attitude. There [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=513.52s)]
*  is no hierarchy of love. And I think, again, not to be too obvious about it, but he is a kind of [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=519.2s)]
*  contrast to Trump himself and the Trump administration in the things that he cares about. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=527.76s)]
*  He's compassionate. He's compassionate for the poor. You treat the other, the immigrant, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=532.96s)]
*  like you treat your own family. That's very, very different than what we're seeing in the White House. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=538.0s)]
*  We're also just getting word that Donald Trump and President Zelensky are speaking by phone. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=542.6400000000001s)]
*  This is according to President Zelensky's spokesperson. We don't have any details. They [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=547.92s)]
*  say they'll provide some details. This, of course, is as this administration is trying to find [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=553.1999999999999s)]
*  some sort of way out of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, but Russia doesn't seem to [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=560.7199999999999s)]
*  have any desire to stop fighting. Yeah. I mean, there's a kind of rule of law, which is the [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=566.0799999999999s)]
*  rule of war rather, that the country that is gaining territory doesn't want to negotiate, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=571.76s)]
*  and the country that's losing territory does want to negotiate. Putin is in an advantageous [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=576.96s)]
*  position for himself now. He's manipulating Donald Trump. Zelensky is trying to get back [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=582.48s)]
*  in Trump's good graces. And Trump, to his credit, doesn't like to see the bombing of civilians in [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=588.88s)]
*  Ukraine. He doesn't like to see that kind of devastation. And maybe Zelensky will have some [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=596.24s)]
*  purchase on this now. We will see. We'll wait for that readout. Rick Sengel, really good to [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=601.6800000000001s)]
*  have you. Governor Kasich, thank you so much for watching on and off. I believe, I hope that when [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=606.56s)]
*  it was off, it was only because you needed to take a bathroom break or something, and you came [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=611.76s)]
*  right back and you kept on watching. But wasn't that moment... Well, you guys have done... Listen, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=615.5999999999999s)]
*  you've done a great job. Just remember this about this man. He's a man of God. So he looks at every [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=621.1999999999999s)]
*  human being equally. No one's more important than anybody else. And for those that are down and out, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=626.64s)]
*  those who are downtrodden, those who live in the shadows, he believes they ought to be lifted. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=631.28s)]
*  And I think that is a wonderful message worldwide, and of course, here in the United [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=635.6s)]
*  States of America. Thanks, ladies. And Governor, wasn't it amazing when Chris yelled out, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvlfbIIEw8&t=640.4s)]
