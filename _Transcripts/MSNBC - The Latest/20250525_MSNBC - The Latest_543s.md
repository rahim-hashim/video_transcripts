# Chicago Mayor on DOJ investigation: ‘Clear demonstration of intimidation’
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM)
*  Again, with President Trump and his Department of Justice threatening and in some cases carrying [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=0.0s)]
*  out legal retribution against his critics from political rivals to law firms to universities [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=6.24s)]
*  and other institutions, it seems like no one is off limits. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=12.48s)]
*  And now the Justice Department has opened the civil rights investigation into the city [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  of Chicago after comments from Mayor Brandon Johnson. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=21.6s)]
*  Speaking at a church last week, Johnson put a spotlight on the black officials in his administration. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=26.32s)]
*  There are some detractors that will push back on me and say, you know, the only thing that [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=32.32s)]
*  the mayor talks about is the hiring of black people. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=38.36s)]
*  No, what I'm saying is when you hire our people, we always look out for everybody else. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=41.44s)]
*  We are the most generous people on the planet. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=48.44s)]
*  I don't know too many cultures that have play cousins. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=54.32s)]
*  Having people in my administration that will look out for the interests of everyone and [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=57.6s)]
*  everyone means you have to look out for the interests of black folks because that hasn't happened. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=63.28s)]
*  Yes, in Trump's world, celebrating diversity makes you a target of a DOJ civil rights investigation. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=70.32s)]
*  Joining us now is Brandon Johnson, the mayor of Chicago. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=79.84s)]
*  Thank you very much for coming to the weekend. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=84.52s)]
*  You know what the first question is going to be. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  It's that obvious. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=88.56s)]
*  What is your reaction to the fact that you are under a civil rights investigation? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=89.72s)]
*  Well, good morning. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=96.08s)]
*  Thank you, Jonathan. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=98.64s)]
*  And congratulations. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=99.64s)]
*  I thought the first question was going to be when are you coming to Chicago with your [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=100.64s)]
*  book tour? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=103.42s)]
*  But I'll accept it as a second question. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=104.42s)]
*  Mr. Mayor, it's Wednesday. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  We'll see you there. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=109.52000000000001s)]
*  The Humanities Festival. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=110.92s)]
*  Go on. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=112.04s)]
*  Perfect. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=113.16000000000001s)]
*  Well, look, I'm incredibly proud that I have put together the most talented, competent, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=114.16000000000001s)]
*  collaborative, compassionate, diverse administration in the history of Chicago. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=120.56s)]
*  You know, it's unfortunate that the president of the United States of America has demonstrated [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  a great deal of animus and disdain towards competent, compassionate, and diverse leadership. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=131.76s)]
*  But it makes sense, though, because obviously his administration doesn't reflect the country. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=138.48000000000002s)]
*  It reflects the country club. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=143.16s)]
*  And when we put together my administration, I was very clear. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=145.36s)]
*  I wanted to make sure that we had people who are capable, people who are passionate about [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=149.52s)]
*  transforming government. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=157.24s)]
*  And that's what we've been able to do. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=159.3s)]
*  Violence is down in the city of Chicago. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=160.8s)]
*  Our investments are up. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=162.96s)]
*  And we're working to build the safest, most affordable big city in America. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=164.44s)]
*  And we're doing that together. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=167.98s)]
*  Mr. Mayor, we've seen the administration go after perceived rivals in other ways. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=169.39999999999998s)]
*  I'm curious, what do you think they are trying to signal to the American people by going [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=177.04s)]
*  after folks with power and access like yourself? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=181.88s)]
*  This is a clear demonstration of not just animus, but intimidation. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=186.28s)]
*  We've been here before in our country's history. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=191.16s)]
*  We've been here before in our world's history. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=194.04s)]
*  As a former public school teacher who taught social studies, I can tell you when people [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=195.79999999999998s)]
*  are standing up for the interests of working people and challenging the power structure, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=200.51999999999998s)]
*  particularly the ultra-rich, people become increasingly intimidated by that. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=205.2s)]
*  And so what they do is they fight back. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=210.39999999999998s)]
*  And they do it in a very dramatic way. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=212.45999999999998s)]
*  And one of those ways is to stifle and silence the voice of resistance. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=215.07999999999998s)]
*  They also go after history. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=220.42s)]
*  They go after the arts. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=221.88s)]
*  They go after the culture. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=222.88s)]
*  This is something that I'm fully aware of. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=224.52s)]
*  And the fact of the matter is this. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=227.12s)]
*  I was elected to bring people together to solve the critical issues that working people [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=228.8s)]
*  are experiencing all over the country, whether it's food insecurity, whether it's the lack [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=234.12s)]
*  of housing. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=238.64s)]
*  I've built 4,000 affordable homes, 1,800 are under construction now. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=239.64s)]
*  We're going to build another 4,600 affordable homes in the next 18 months. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=244.52s)]
*  We are hiring our young people. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=249.12s)]
*  We're expanding mental and behavioral health care services. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=251.24s)]
*  These are the things that the American people want leadership to react to versus what Donald [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=257.84000000000003s)]
*  Trump is reacting to. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=262.64s)]
*  And he's reacting to the interests of the ultra-rich in this country. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=264.16s)]
*  But the city of Chicago, we're going to remain firm, and we will not be intimidated by this [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=268.96000000000004s)]
*  tyrant. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=273.64s)]
*  Mr. Mayor, today is the fifth anniversary of George Floyd's killing. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=275.64s)]
*  As we remember that memorial, at the same time, alongside that, it coincides with the [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=280.88s)]
*  Trump administration, the Justice Department pulling civil rights investigations in police [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=286.36s)]
*  departments. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=291.24s)]
*  What does this say about this moment? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=292.68s)]
*  And can you talk about what you're doing with policing in Chicago to try to prevent killings [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=295.8s)]
*  like that which happened to George Floyd? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=301.92s)]
*  Well, this is why we have to have political and organizing working together. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=305.11999999999995s)]
*  We have to resist the frame, quite frankly, of the tenor that is coming from this White [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=311.52s)]
*  House. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=318.44s)]
*  And as we reflect on the brutality that has been carried out by the state, in order for [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=319.44s)]
*  us to build safer cities, we have to make sure that there's trust between law enforcement [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=325.53999999999996s)]
*  and the residents. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=331.55999999999995s)]
*  We're doing that in the city of Chicago, building constitutional policing, solving crime, making [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=333.12s)]
*  sure our detectives have the tools that they need. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=338.22s)]
*  But it's not just policing. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=340.78000000000003s)]
*  It's policing and affordable housing. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=342.14000000000004s)]
*  It's policing and mental health support services. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=344.3s)]
*  It's policing and making sure that we have a workforce that can actually afford to live [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=346.86s)]
*  in a city. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=351.66s)]
*  You know, that's why we abolished the subminimum wage here in Chicago. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=352.66s)]
*  We've expanded pay time off, where workers have 10 days off to spend time with their [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=356.22s)]
*  families. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=360.62s)]
*  And I think that, by this moment, it's so critical that we all come together because [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=362.26s)]
*  these issues are connected. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=364.26s)]
*  Unfortunately, there has been this addiction on jails and incarceration, where we're doing [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=366.34000000000003s)]
*  it differently. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=371.94s)]
*  The safest cities in America all have one thing in common. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=373.18s)]
*  They invest in people. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=376.36s)]
*  And that's what I'm doing in Chicago. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=377.78000000000003s)]
*  We're going to build the safest, most affordable big city in America, and it's going to take [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=379.68s)]
*  all of us to do that. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=383.56s)]
*  Mr. Mayor, picking up on this, how concerned are you that the president will follow through [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=386.06s)]
*  on his multiple threats to use the military on the streets of Chicago to, in his view, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=393.58s)]
*  get crime under control, to yank federal funding from Chicago? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=400.17999999999995s)]
*  Your reaction to those threats? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=406.9s)]
*  Well, look, I take them seriously. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=408.97999999999996s)]
*  His actions have certainly been inimical to the interest of working people, but we're [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=412.82s)]
*  not going to cower to his hostility. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=417.34s)]
*  I mean, here's what I'm really pleased with. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=419.7s)]
*  Again, with a talented, well-qualified, diverse administration, homicides are down 21 percent, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=423.02s)]
*  shootings are down, robberies are down, and investments are up. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=429.58s)]
*  We are transforming this city with a collective response in a holistic way, the full force [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=433.94s)]
*  of government. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=439.74s)]
*  And this is why I continue to challenge folks around this country, and we're doing this [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=440.90000000000003s)]
*  in Chicago. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=444.02s)]
*  The best way in which we can have secure communities is by investing in them. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=445.3s)]
*  When there's good-paying jobs, when we're investing in our education system as a public [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=451.34000000000003s)]
*  school teacher, we just settled a teachers contract where we lowered class sizes. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=455.74s)]
*  We are providing more behavioral and mental health support services with social workers [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=461.08s)]
*  and counselors. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=465.16s)]
*  We're giving control to the community so that the community can help direct the interest [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=466.94s)]
*  of their local schools. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=471.02s)]
*  We're protecting Black history, LGBTQ+, we're also protecting immigrants. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=472.61999999999995s)]
*  There's more than enough for everyone in this country, and that's why the city of Chicago [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=478.34s)]
*  and my administration is so focused on whether we are providing a pathway for reparations [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=482.9s)]
*  while also protecting immigrants. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=489.85999999999996s)]
*  That's the story of Chicago. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=492.34s)]
*  A Black Haitian immigrant and a Pottawatomie woman established a trade post at the bank [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTQXNVFJDBM&t=493.82s)]
