*  to a long list of these crimes that he would be given a degree of leniency by the judge he was [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5DwjMLxRDk&t=40.08s)]
*  hoping for as little as two years in prison but the judge thought differently and sided with [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5DwjMLxRDk&t=45.28s)]
*  prosecutors and have has given him 87 months in prison which is equivalent to more than seven years [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5DwjMLxRDk&t=50.4s)]
*  in prison he's also being forced to pay back more than 300 000 in restitution almost 300 and four [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5DwjMLxRDk&t=57.92s)]
*  or 380 000 in restitution and also forfeit more than 200 000 this sentence is far beyond what [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5DwjMLxRDk&t=64.64s)]
*  santos had hoped but it's important to keep in mind jose the way that santos conducted himself [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5DwjMLxRDk&t=74.24s)]
*  after initially agreeing to plead guilty you know he had fought back said that he was going to take [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5DwjMLxRDk&t=80.47999999999999s)]
*  this case all the way to a jury at one point claimed that he was not guilty of any of these crimes [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5DwjMLxRDk&t=85.75999999999999s)]
*  against him despite the overwhelming evidence that prosecutors had and then he made an abrupt [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5DwjMLxRDk&t=91.6s)]
*  bout about face decided to plead guilty tearfully outside the federal courthouse in august of last [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5DwjMLxRDk&t=96.08s)]
*  year admitted that he was guilty of these crimes and in many ways throwing himself on the mercy of [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5DwjMLxRDk&t=102.08s)]
*  asking for a lenient sentence but in the days after that he used a number of different social [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5DwjMLxRDk&t=108.08s)]
*  media platforms to try and argue that perhaps he wasn't as guilty as federal prosecutors claim [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5DwjMLxRDk&t=113.2s)]
*  that he was the victim of a witch hunt because of his conservative politics he used the platform [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5DwjMLxRDk&t=118.64s)]
*  cameo to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars bragging that he was making more money on cameo [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5DwjMLxRDk&t=123.6s)]
*  than he ever would have made as a member of congress and there was no doubt that the judge [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5DwjMLxRDk&t=128.88s)]
*  took this into consideration that a part of the reason that they were looking for a more lenient [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5DwjMLxRDk&t=134.08s)]
*  sentence was because that he admitted that he had done something wrong and that he was trying to [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5DwjMLxRDk&t=139.44000000000003s)]
*  change his ways and that he felt guilty and felt remorse for the victims that were impacted by his [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5DwjMLxRDk&t=143.44s)]
*  crimes clearly the judge felt that that explanation of his remorse and his admitting of his guilt [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5DwjMLxRDk&t=149.44s)]
*  was not authentic and they have sided with the prosecutors completely with this 87 month jail [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5DwjMLxRDk&t=156.56s)]
*  term the other interesting thing in the back of all this jose is the effort that he may be [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5DwjMLxRDk&t=162.4s)]
*  attempting to try and receive some sort of clemency or pardon from president trump this [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5DwjMLxRDk&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  isn't something that he's explicitly asked for and it's not something that president trump has even [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5DwjMLxRDk&t=174.24s)]
*  indicated that he'd be willing or open to doing so but santos has said in the past that if it [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5DwjMLxRDk&t=178.56s)]
*  was offered he would certainly accept it [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5DwjMLxRDk&t=182.96s)]
*  you [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5DwjMLxRDk&t=192.4s)]
