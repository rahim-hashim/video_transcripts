# 'Corruption out in the open': Oversight congressman on Trump admin grift
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs)
*  From the first Trump administration to this one, just the ways in which he has enriched [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=0.0s)]
*  himself or his businesses. For example, in the first administration, he always stayed at Trump [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=5.36s)]
*  properties. Same thing now. And the Secret Service has to pay to house Secret Service at those Trump [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=10.16s)]
*  properties when he's traveling and staying at Trump hotels. Now it's just on a bigger scale. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=15.76s)]
*  From the crypto, the Bitcoin, to this plane, which it's my understanding that the, and I've [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=20.96s)]
*  talked about the plane, the Qatari plane. Not finalized. Not finalized yet. We heard that from [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=28.64s)]
*  DOD sources and now the Qataris are saying, we don't yet have a deal. What is it going to take [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=34.56s)]
*  to stop? What is it going to take? Like when Democrats are always talking about how they're [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  going to take back the house, I think you all are in a very position to do so, a good position to [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=46.96s)]
*  do so. But let's just say you take it back next November. What are y'all going to do? Because it's [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=51.2s)]
*  not going to be enough to put out a strongly worded statement and send a letter. Yeah, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=55.44s)]
*  absolutely. I mean, again, the corruption is something that should be bipartisan. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=59.12s)]
*  We should be calling it out every step of the way. We should not get tired of calling it out. This [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=63.28s)]
*  is something that even Republicans I talked to are uncomfortable about. And so we have to continue [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=67.67999999999999s)]
*  hammering it because right now they keep talking about waste, fraud and abuse, right? And how [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=72.4s)]
*  they're trying to root out corruption. And that's when they themselves are actually making corruption [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=77.68s)]
*  worse. They are actually taking advantage of the system. Trump is enriching himself every step of [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=82.56s)]
*  the way. The only thing that's different from the first term is he got better at it this time. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=87.60000000000001s)]
*  And so we have to call it out and we have to fight against this notion that they want to root out [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=92.0s)]
*  waste, fraud and abuse. It's just not true. A big part of the handicap that you have as a member [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=97.68s)]
*  of Congress, aside from the fact you're in the minority and you have a majority that quite frankly [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=103.92s)]
*  don't give a damn about any of this, right? Trump can do whatever he wants. They're not going to [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=110.88s)]
*  respond. But the fact that you don't have the inspectors generals in the various departments [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=116.0s)]
*  and agencies that are impacted by a lot of this grift, you don't have people in place who were [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=122.16s)]
*  in the last administration who would see something like this and respond publicly or at least in their [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=131.35999999999999s)]
*  job refuse to play along. How do you now as part of oversight, and you know it's a long way between [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=138.56s)]
*  now and next November when the likelihood of a change could occur, do you level up some degree [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=147.28s)]
*  of enforcement or oversight with teeth given the way the numbers work against you in the House? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=154.88s)]
*  Is it just the public projection and rhetoric that you put out in front of the public or is it holding [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=161.36s)]
*  investigations? What do they call them? They're not mock investigations, shadow investigations. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  How do you see that working particularly given that you're now going to have a little bit of [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=174.4s)]
*  the politics on the Democratic side for oversight, a ranking member, etc.? Yeah, all of the above. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=179.76s)]
*  I mean we can't be afraid to think outside the box. We have to do everything possible. We're [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=187.04s)]
*  starting to have shadow hearings outside of DC. We're starting to do more sort of internal [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  investigations. We're supporting the litigation on the outside. It's all of the above. We have to [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=197.68s)]
*  do everything right now. We cannot wait until next November in the midterms because they're [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=202.4s)]
*  just going to continue to do this, right? And the damage might be irreversible by the time we have [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=206.96s)]
*  the ability to subpoena people and maybe too late in some instances to reverse some of the damage. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=211.44s)]
*  So we just have to continue to be aggressive right now. And then what I've done is simply say if I [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=216.0s)]
*  can help in any way, if I need to be at a protest, if I need to be at a hearing, if I need to come up [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=221.60000000000002s)]
*  with a hearing, let's do it all because this is something that even Republicans are uncomfortable [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=225.92s)]
*  with. We have to continue to make them uncomfortable. A big part of the discourse right now within the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=231.04s)]
*  Democratic Party is what is going to be required of Democratic leadership. And while you're seeing [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=234.79999999999998s)]
*  that play out for sort of the party at large, you're also seeing it play out in these committees. You [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=238.79999999999998s)]
*  have Robert Garcia, one of your colleagues, who has formally announced his candidacy to be ranking [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=243.76s)]
*  member on House Oversight Committee. There are a number of other names in the mix including [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=248.88s)]
*  Jasmine Crockett of Texas. Have you decided who it is that you will be supporting and what are you [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=253.36s)]
*  really looking for? What do you think is required? What is the right profile for the person who's [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=258.96000000000004s)]
*  going to have what is now one of the single most important jobs in the U.S. House of Representatives? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=264.56s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. I mean, yeah, I don't know who else is running yet. So once I get the final list, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=269.28000000000003s)]
*  I'll make a decision. But with that said, I think all the people who have put their name in the ring [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=272.88s)]
*  are good people. I don't think we're one oversight ranking member away from fixing what's wrong in the [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=277.12s)]
*  party or, you know, being able to have a powerful message. But given how much people want to see [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=282.72s)]
*  Democrats fight and given that one of the places you have to fight is- Who's your fighter? Yeah, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=287.52000000000004s)]
*  who is your fighter? Who's your fighter? Yeah, no, they all need to be fighters. That's going to be [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=291.92s)]
*  my number one criteria is who's going to push back forcefully and convince not just the Democratic [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=295.92s)]
*  base but also the people on the Republican side, maybe Trump voters who are uncomfortable with [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=301.12s)]
*  what's going on, convince them that what's going on is wrong. Show them the corruption. Demonstrate [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=306.16s)]
*  that we can be a good alternative to them as well. That's just as important. A lot of us are [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=312.48s)]
*  in swing districts, right? I'm in one that's a swingier district. And so it's not just about [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=316.72s)]
*  playing to the very deep blue Democratic seats. It's also about convincing all of the American [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=320.88s)]
*  people that what's going on is wrong. Well, let's talk about part of that then. Let's talk about [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=325.52000000000004s)]
*  Elon Musk. You know, I've seen a lot of headlines, Congressman, over the last 24 hours, Elon Musk's [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=330.0s)]
*  exit. He is leaving Washington. But I think that Elon Musk is just finished. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=337.28s)]
*  I have not heard a lot of Democratic elected officials talk about the data. Elon Musk and his [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=344.4s)]
*  Doge peeps, if you will, they installed servers within the White House complex. They were integral [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=350.4s)]
*  within the office of presidential personnel, which has tentacles out into every single agency. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=358.79999999999995s)]
*  They have inroads into every single agency now. Doge was in there. And he didn't take those servers [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=365.03999999999996s)]
*  with him. The servers, I don't think, have left the White House. And so what are Democrats going [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=370.08s)]
*  to do about the data? Are you all going to follow up on this? What's your take on Elon Musk being [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=374.47999999999996s)]
*  done? Because I just think he's finished. He's just finished what he was doing. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=379.68s)]
*  Actually, he's finished. He's not done because they've still got the data. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=383.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I heard he's on some image repair tour. I think the best way for him to repair his image [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=386.56s)]
*  is to reverse all the damage he did to our government, to the American people. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=391.6s)]
*  And yeah, those servers are a big issue. We want to continue to investigate that. And certainly, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=395.36s)]
*  I think some crimes may have been committed over the past three or four months. And they are going [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=400.24s)]
*  to come to light one way or another. They're going to come to light, even if it takes us getting into [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=404.0s)]
*  power again. But we will subpoena people and find out. But in the meantime, we can't wait, right? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=409.36s)]
*  We don't know what kind of damage is happening already. And so yeah, you might be right. But [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=414.0s)]
*  I'll say that again, even Elon Musk, he's going back to these industries. EVs have been attacked [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=417.84s)]
*  by Republicans. Space, they're cutting NASA. He's even done damage to his own industries without [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=424.4s)]
*  realizing it, right? I guess he's been trying to get all these contracts for himself. But we as [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=430.23999999999995s)]
*  Democrats need to tell the story to everyone that what's happening is damaging every single American. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=434.79999999999995s)]
*  And that's what I want out of our party right now. And we're starting to do it more, I think. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=440.47999999999996s)]
*  Did you hear that from the farmers today? What did they talk about? I know you were with the [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=444.15999999999997s)]
*  farmers earlier. The farmers are great, yeah. Although they're worried right now about what's [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=446.4s)]
*  going on. What's happening in D.C. and what Republicans are doing? Medicaid cuts, tariffs [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=449.44s)]
*  are affecting farmers, many of whom voted for Trump as well. The farmers are paying attention, y'all. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWTLQYl6bs&t=454.32s)]
