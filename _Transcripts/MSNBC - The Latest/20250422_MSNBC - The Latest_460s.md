# Polling debunks Musk excuse that his unpopularity, collapse of Tesla, is because of paid protesters
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k)
*  So I think the protests are really starting to bug them. I don't know if it's the number of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=0.0s)]
*  protests or the number of people protesting or the fact that the protests really aren't going away [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=6.12s)]
*  and they keep seeming to grow. I don't know if it's the tenor and good humor and peaceful nature [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=12.18s)]
*  of the protest that's bugging them, but I think they're really getting bugged. I think it is [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=17.28s)]
*  really getting under their skin. And here's one way we can tell. Let's say you're the head of a [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  big car company and then something happens to your car company. And it's not happening to all car [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=27.28s)]
*  companies. It's not happening to the car sector, right? In fact, it's not happening to any other [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=33.84s)]
*  car company at all. It's only happening to your car company and it's not good. Headline, CNN, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=38.64s)]
*  Tesla profits plunge. Headline, Washington Post, Tesla earnings plunge. Headline, New York Times, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=46.64s)]
*  Tesla's 71% drop in profit. Headline, USA Today, Tesla profits fall 71%. Headline, Wall Street [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=54.28s)]
*  Journal, Tesla profit sinks. Headline, Reuters, Tesla sales skid. If you are the head of a company [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  that is having a day like that, how do you spend that day? How do you spend that day that that news [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=70.48s)]
*  breaks everywhere? Because I mean, headlines like that are bad enough, but you look at the details, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=77.92s)]
*  it's even worse. I mean, Tesla was expected to earn 41 cents per share. They came in at 27 cents [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=83.84s)]
*  per share. That's like not only below market expectations, it's really, really below market [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=92.16000000000001s)]
*  expectations. The first quarter of last year, Tesla made $1.4 billion. The first quarter of this year, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=97.36000000000001s)]
*  we learned today, you can drop the billion off of that. They went from $1.4 billion in the first [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=105.36s)]
*  quarter of last year to $0.4 billion this quarter. And even that was less than it appears. Tesla not [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=113.36s)]
*  only had that 71% drop in profit off of what they did last year, the profit they did have [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=122.8s)]
*  is not from selling cars. Tesla would have actually lost hundreds of millions of dollars this quarter [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=130.72s)]
*  had it not earned $400 million in interest on cash and investments and had it not earned $595 million [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  from selling credits to other car makers, which themselves failed to meet emissions regulations. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=146.72s)]
*  So yeah, it looks like they made $0.4 billion. It looks like they made $400 million, but they [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=152.96s)]
*  would have been $600 million in the negative for this quarter. They would have lost $600 million [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=158.88s)]
*  this quarter if they hadn't had cash and investments, interest payments, and credits that [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  were paid to them from other car companies because of anti-climate change government programs. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=173.12s)]
*  That's what filled up their balance sheet. Just a catastrophe. And to add insult to injury, the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=179.11999999999998s)]
*  CEO's favorite of all his vehicles, at least the one he really, really, really likes to talk about [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=186.32s)]
*  and show off as much as possible, that is turning out to itself be the biggest disaster of all. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=191.35999999999999s)]
*  Quote, the Cybertruck, Tesla's newest vehicle, which consumed a lot of the company's resources [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=196.39999999999998s)]
*  while it was being developed, is looking increasingly like a flop. The Cybertruck, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=201.76s)]
*  sales of the Cybertruck in the first quarter were down about 50% from the last quarter of last year. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  And they weren't all that good in the last quarter of last year. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=216.48000000000002s)]
*  President's top campaign donor is bothered by your protests. He said today, unasked, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  on this disastrous earnings call about the cratering of his car company, the stock price of which, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=226.56s)]
*  incidentally, is the basis for basically all his wealth. He said today on that call, volunteered, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=232.24s)]
*  that these protests, you know, they're all a hoax. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=238.56s)]
*  But he also had to reassure investors that he is going to scale back his involvement in the Trump [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=243.44000000000003s)]
*  administration in coming weeks. And we shall see. But if he thinks the protests against him in the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=248.4s)]
*  streets are some kind of artificial trick, some kind of paid hoax, and people don't really dislike [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=257.12s)]
*  him, who's going to tell him about the polling? Because separate and apart from the protests, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=261.76s)]
*  the polling in many ways is even worse. And it is bad for him and also for Trump. And for Trump, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=267.44s)]
*  it just keeps getting worse and worse and worse with each new poll. For example, the new Reuters [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=273.76s)]
*  Ipsos poll that's out today. Do you approve of the job Donald Trump is doing as president? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=277.92s)]
*  No, by an 11-point margin. Do you approve of Donald Trump's performance on the economy? No, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=282.72s)]
*  by a 14-point margin. Should Donald Trump withhold funding from universities he disagrees with? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=289.04s)]
*  No, by a 29-point margin. Should President Trump take control of national museums and theaters? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=295.52s)]
*  No, by a 52-point margin. Should Donald Trump obey court orders that he disagrees with? Should [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=302.47999999999996s)]
*  President Trump obey court orders that he disagrees with? Yes, he should obey those court orders. 83% [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=310.08s)]
*  of Americans say yes, he should. Only 13% say no. That is a 70-point margin. That's Reuters Ipsos [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=316.96s)]
*  polling out today. New polling out today also from CNBC. Do you approve of the job Donald Trump [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=324.88s)]
*  is doing as president? No, by a 7-point margin. Do you approve of Donald Trump's handling of the [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=329.84s)]
*  economy? No, by a 12-point margin. Do you approve of Donald Trump's handling of tariffs? No, by a 16-point [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=334.32s)]
*  margin. Do you approve of Donald Trump's handling of inflation? No, by a 23-point margin. CNBC also [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=340.71999999999997s)]
*  asked, do you think we're going to have a recession in the next year? Americans say yes, by an 8-point [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=348.56s)]
*  margin. Then they ask the follow-up question, well, if we do have a recession in the next year, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=353.76s)]
*  will you blame Trump for it? Yes. Yes, we will, by a 20-point margin. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=358.4s)]
*  But also, look at this. This is not just for Trump. This is also for Musk. This is also from today's [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=366.0s)]
*  CNBC poll. Do you have a positive or negative view of the U.S. auto industry as a whole? Positive. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=372.4s)]
*  Plus 14. Do you have a positive or negative view of General Motors, GM? Very positive. Plus 23. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=379.28s)]
*  Do you have a positive or negative view of Tesla? Negative. Minus 20. Wait, GM is plus 23. Tesla is [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=387.2s)]
*  minus 20. Do you have a positive or negative view of Elon Musk? Negative. Minus 20. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=395.76s)]
*  And this is a nice cross-tab for a man who likes to think he's big with the kids. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=403.84s)]
*  Among young people age 18 to 34 in this CNBC poll, they say they are very positive on EVs, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=408.0s)]
*  on electric vehicles in general. Generally, young people are positive, plus 19 on electric vehicles. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=414.72s)]
*  But on Tesla, they are minus 23. All the people in that poll must be paid. They must be fraudsters [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=421.76s)]
*  who just love waste. Who's going to tell them? I think the protests are going to continue. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU23jm417-k&t=432.64s)]
