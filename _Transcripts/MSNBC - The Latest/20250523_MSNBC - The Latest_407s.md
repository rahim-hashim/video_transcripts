# 'Mixed messages' from Trump admin over nuclear talks with Iran: Fmr. Deputy NSA
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI)
*  Today in Rome, President Trump's special envoy to the Middle East is meeting with Iranian [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=0.0s)]
*  negotiators in search of a nuclear deal. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=4.48s)]
*  The stakes raised even higher by new reporting that Israel is preparing to strike Iranian [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=7.36s)]
*  nuclear sites if these talks don't work out. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=12.48s)]
*  Tehran responded by threatening to move its nuclear material to secret sites, making it [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=15.36s)]
*  harder for international monitors to know whether Iran is building a nuclear weapon [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=20.72s)]
*  or not. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=24.88s)]
*  I want to bring in someone who has worked with the Obama White House to negotiate the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=25.88s)]
*  previous nuclear deal with Iran, Ben Rhodes, former deputy national security advisor and [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=29.44s)]
*  MSNBC political contributor. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  So Ben, President Trump suggests the deal is imminent. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=36.84s)]
*  We're hearing something completely different from Iran's supreme leader who says he's doubtful [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  these talks will lead to anything. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=44.92s)]
*  He also insists that they're not going to stop enriching uranium. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=46.6s)]
*  You know how painstaking these kinds of negotiations are. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=51.0s)]
*  What do you make of what is being said on both sides publicly? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=55.92s)]
*  Well, it feels to me, Chris, like everybody is posturing for some kind of endgame for [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=59.28s)]
*  these negotiations. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=65.92s)]
*  Israel is threatening military action to try to compel Iran or the U.S. maybe to push harder [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=67.92s)]
*  for Iranian concessions. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=75.6s)]
*  Iran is making clear their red lines around enrichment. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=77.92s)]
*  Iran and the U.S. is mainly making clear its interest in reaching a deal. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=82.28s)]
*  Now, there's a number of things that are challenging here, Chris. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=87.08s)]
*  I mean, the first is they're trying to conduct what is a pretty complicated set of negotiations [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=90.28s)]
*  around pretty technical issues really quickly, you know, within a period of weeks. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=95.6s)]
*  And I hasten to add, Chris, that if Trump hadn't pulled out of the nuclear deal that [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=100.75999999999999s)]
*  Obama negotiated, we wouldn't be in this situation. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=104.88s)]
*  But put that aside. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=107.39999999999999s)]
*  I think the bottom line here is that if the Trump administration is willing to accept [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=108.72000000000001s)]
*  an existing Iranian enrichment capability, if they can continue to operate some of their [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=114.68s)]
*  centrifuges, continue to have some domestic enrichment capability, they can get a deal. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=120.16000000000001s)]
*  And it's going to be a deal that looks somewhat like the Obama deal. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=126.08000000000001s)]
*  If they insist on the complete destruction of any enrichment capability, I think it's [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  very unlikely that the Iranians would accept that. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=135.48000000000002s)]
*  It's a matter of pride. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=137.92s)]
*  It's a matter of their ultimate hedge to want to maintain some kind of nuclear capability [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=139.72s)]
*  on their soil. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=145.24s)]
*  So that's really, I think, where this trade space is. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=146.84s)]
*  And we've seen mixed messages from the Trump administration and Steve Witkoff on this. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=149.28s)]
*  At times, they've suggested they could live with that if they shipped all their nuclear [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=152.92s)]
*  material out of the country and they enriched at a much lower level than they currently [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=156.51999999999998s)]
*  do. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=160.04s)]
*  But at other times, they've kind of spoken to their more hardline base and saying, no, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=161.04s)]
*  no, we want to see all enrichment gone. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=164.2s)]
*  I think that's ultimately where this is going to end up, is whether Trump can accept a deal [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=165.64000000000001s)]
*  that is more like Obama's and that they maintain a minimal capability with very stringent verification. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=170.92000000000002s)]
*  I mean, is it not a deal? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  I mean, well, look, it's not a deal until it's a deal. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=178.2s)]
*  But in advance of that, Ben, are there things that we can be looking for to determine if [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=181.04s)]
*  at least progress is being made? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=185.22s)]
*  I think that you will see the messaging coming out of the governments about whether they're [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=186.96s)]
*  expressing optimism. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=197.32s)]
*  But I also think with the Iranians, at times, they feel compelled to make it look like they're [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=198.32s)]
*  willing to walk away from the table. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=203.12s)]
*  So it's going to be hard to read too much into the public statements, because there's [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=204.44s)]
*  some interest on both sides in taking kind of harder lines publicly. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=208.04000000000002s)]
*  Frankly, I wish that there was less public talk about this than there is it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=211.24s)]
*  It kind of makes it harder when you're taking negotiating positions in public, as both sides [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=216.76s)]
*  have. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=220.88s)]
*  But ultimately, I think the thing to look for, again, Chris, is if the Trump administration [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=222.28s)]
*  of Witkoff indicates that they're willing to accept some domestic enrichment capability [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=226.95999999999998s)]
*  for Iran, that would tell me that we're very close to a deal. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=233.12s)]
*  If they walk out of these meetings and say, we continue to insist that essentially the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=236.72s)]
*  Iranian nuclear program be dismantled and they have none of that capability, then I [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=241.44s)]
*  think we might be headed for a world of no deal. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=245.6s)]
*  I think that the Israeli threats, in a strange way, may actually increase Trump's willingness [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=248.84s)]
*  to accept something, because what Trump doesn't want, and frankly what the Gulf Arab states [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=255.2s)]
*  that he just visited don't want, is a war in the Middle East, another war in the Middle [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=259.76s)]
*  East, which is what would happen if Israel hit those nuclear sites. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=263.28s)]
*  So, you know, we'll see how flexible they're going to be here in the coming days. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=267.4s)]
*  I want to ask you also about the other big story of the day, Trump threatening a new [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=273.0s)]
*  50 percent tariff on the European Union. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=277.59999999999997s)]
*  The EU is already trying to figure out how to support Ukraine and punish Russia without [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=280.52s)]
*  the help of the United States. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=285.44s)]
*  What are the potential consequences of this kind of economic clash with the transatlantic [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=287.79999999999995s)]
*  alliance? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=292.59999999999997s)]
*  It just couldn't be coming at a worse time, Chris. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=293.59999999999997s)]
*  I talk to a lot of Europeans, and the reality is they already feel completely abandoned [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=296.88s)]
*  by Trump on Ukraine. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=300.64s)]
*  They've not supported, despite their need to kind of put on a brave face in public. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=302.56s)]
*  You know, they would not have taken this approach to Putin in the negotiations, where you essentially [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=307.71999999999997s)]
*  try to negotiate the end of the war with Putin directly. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=312.84s)]
*  They feel like their own security is at stake there. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=316.28s)]
*  They did not appreciate JD Vance flying to Europe and kind of endorsing the far-right [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=318.44s)]
*  party, or at least suggesting that the Europeans needed to embrace and create space for their [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=322.91999999999996s)]
*  own far-right parties. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=328.84s)]
*  So this comes on top of what has already been a rupture between the U.S. and Europe on a [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=330.84s)]
*  number of pretty existential issues for the Europeans. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=335.64s)]
*  And my concern is, look, for U.S. interests, in the long run, obviously, I think we're [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=338.88s)]
*  stronger with allies. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=342.96s)]
*  We're stronger in standing up to Putin. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=343.96s)]
*  We're stronger in dealing with global issues. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=345.32s)]
*  But also, it's going to incentivize, over time, the Europeans to look to China, to look [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=347.59999999999997s)]
*  to India, to look away from the United States for its own trading relationships, its own [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=352.48s)]
*  supply chains. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=357.28s)]
*  So, yes, while the Europeans may try to do something to avoid these more severe tariffs [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=358.68s)]
*  coming into force, I think you're going to start to see them hedge against the over-dependence [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=363.44s)]
*  on the United States, not just on security, but on trade as well. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=368.88s)]
*  And in the long run, I think that would be very bad for the U.S. economy, because—and [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=371.68s)]
*  very good for countries like China that offer an alternative source of trade and supply [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=376.76s)]
*  chains. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=381.52s)]
*  Ben Rhodes, always good to see you. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=382.52s)]
*  Have a good holiday weekend. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=384.32s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=385.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_dbd7qgUI&t=388.68s)]
