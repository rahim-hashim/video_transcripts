# Lawrence: Trump's stupidity has power so you can always feel the danger of that stupidity
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ)
*  Well, one day in the basement of the Hart Senate office building, my life changed after [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=0.0s)]
*  I filled out an address in Social Security number form for my first real job. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=5.2s)]
*  And just when I thought I was finished with everything I needed to do in that otherwise [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=12.32s)]
*  forgettable moment in a forgettable-looking office space, I was suddenly and very much, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=16.46s)]
*  to my surprise, told to raise my right hand. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=24.12s)]
*  I was then asked to repeat words that I had never heard before and have never forgotten. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=29.1s)]
*  I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=37.22s)]
*  against all enemies, foreign and domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=41.980000000000004s)]
*  to the same, that I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=47.34s)]
*  of evasion, and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  I am about to enter so help me but God. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=58.379999999999995s)]
*  Defend the Constitution of the United States. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=63.459999999999994s)]
*  The weight of those words changed me as I spoke them. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=66.58s)]
*  I had no idea that everyone working in the Senate, from the receptionists to the senators [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=71.02s)]
*  themselves, take the same oath of office, word for word. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=76.9s)]
*  And in that instant, the job that I thought was going to be, at most, a temporary detour [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=81.74s)]
*  in my work life that I was probably ill-suited for, was by far suddenly the most important [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=88.78s)]
*  job that I would ever have. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=96.53999999999999s)]
*  I knew that day, in that moment, with my hand raised, that the importance of my work was [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=98.82s)]
*  going to peak right there in the United States Senate in my 30s because I knew that for [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=104.3s)]
*  the rest of my life I could not possibly have a job as important as defending the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=111.7s)]
*  Constitution of the United States. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=117.82000000000001s)]
*  I knew I would never have another job that required me to take an oath of office. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=119.86s)]
*  I worked in the Senate for several years and was promoted to other jobs within the Senate [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=125.22s)]
*  but that first oath held throughout my career on the staff of the United States Senate. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=128.74s)]
*  For the more committed Senate staffers, that oath holds for 30 years and sometimes longer, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=133.24s)]
*  no matter how many times they change jobs within the Senate. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=138.78s)]
*  And years later, in a TV drama that I created for NBC called Mr. Sterling, I gave those [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=143.28s)]
*  words to Josh Brolin for his oath of office scene as a new United States Senator with [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=147.22s)]
*  his father, played by the great James Whitmore, watching at home on TV. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=152.44s)]
*  And in that scene, James Whitmore chose to silently mouth some of the words of the oath [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=157.98000000000002s)]
*  while holding back his tears. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=165.10000000000002s)]
*  And I realized that James Whitmore expressed my feelings about the oath more eloquently [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=167.5s)]
*  than I ever could. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=174.04s)]
*  And that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=175.04s)]
*  to enter. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=182.04s)]
*  And that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=183.04s)]
*  to enter. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=188.04000000000002s)]
*  So help me God. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=189.04000000000002s)]
*  So help me God. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=190.04000000000002s)]
*  The presidential oath of office is shorter, but it ends with those same words, defend [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=191.95999999999998s)]
*  the Constitution of the United States. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=198.68s)]
*  Presidential oath is, I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=201.28s)]
*  of the President of the United States and will, to the best of my ability, preserve, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=204.88s)]
*  protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=209.12s)]
*  Donald Trump has taken that oath twice and was obviously unmoved by it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=211.84s)]
*  He also obviously did not listen to it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=217.02s)]
*  And he has proved that many times, but never more clearly than in an answer to Kristen [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  Welker's question about due process for immigrants on Meet the Press. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=224.70000000000002s)]
*  Don't you need to uphold the Constitution of the United States as president, to which [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=230.56s)]
*  Donald Trump said, I don't know? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=235.18s)]
*  Don't you need to uphold the Constitution of the United States as president? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=240.58s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=243.14000000000001s)]
*  I have to respond by saying again, I have brilliant lawyers that work for me, and they [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=244.82000000000002s)]
*  are going to obviously follow what the Supreme Court said. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=251.18s)]
*  Only one president of the United States in American history could possibly have said, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=256.02s)]
*  I don't know, to the question, do you need to uphold the Constitution of the United States [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=259.78000000000003s)]
*  as president? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=265.82s)]
*  Every president prior to Donald Trump knew the answer to that question. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=267.06s)]
*  They always knew the answer is one word. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=270.84000000000003s)]
*  Yes, every one of them. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=273.34s)]
*  Joe Biden took an oath of office more than any other president. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=275.53999999999996s)]
*  He took an oath of office 10 times, seven as a senator, twice as vice president, and [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=278.85999999999996s)]
*  once as president. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=283.41999999999996s)]
*  And Joe Biden meant every word of that oath, including very much so, the so help me God [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=284.41999999999996s)]
*  part of that oath. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=291.14s)]
*  Joe Biden lived that oath of office. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=292.46s)]
*  No president had more reverence for that oath than Joe Biden. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=295.5s)]
*  And now, right after Joe Biden, we have a president who does not know what reverence [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=299.66s)]
*  is or what his oath means. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=305.14000000000004s)]
*  Donald Trump talks about his predecessor in office more than any other president has ever [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=308.1s)]
*  talked about their predecessors. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=313.18s)]
*  And in that same interview on Meet the Press, Donald Trump called President Biden, quote, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=315.54s)]
*  a stupid person and a very stupid person. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=320.02000000000004s)]
*  Donald Trump said at least one thing in the interview that was true. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=324.02s)]
*  Well, prices are already going up on some popular items. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=330.02s)]
*  Tires, strollers. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=335.02s)]
*  This is such a dishonest interview already. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=336.88s)]
*  He's right. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=340.94s)]
*  He's right. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=341.94s)]
*  Donald Trump is the dishonest part of that interview. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=343.18s)]
*  It was already a dishonest interview made dishonest by Donald Trump, and it remained [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=348.94s)]
*  a dishonest interview in every reply Donald Trump gave. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=354.21999999999997s)]
*  It was a standard Trump dishonest interview from start to finish with Donald Trump lying [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=359.21999999999997s)]
*  at every turn and with Donald Trump proving once again that he is, to use his words, a [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=363.56s)]
*  stupid person, a very stupid person. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=370.22s)]
*  Donald Trump talks repeatedly in the interview about how much money we were losing because [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=376.06s)]
*  of international trade. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=383.1s)]
*  We have never lost a penny because of international trade. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=385.12s)]
*  Donald Trump said, quote, we were losing hundreds of billions of dollars with China. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=389.82s)]
*  Now think about how very stupid and dishonest that statement is. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=395.02s)]
*  Donald Trump is counting every penny we spend on imported products as lost money. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=398.98s)]
*  That means every time we spend money, we are losing money, according to that theory. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=405.46s)]
*  Every one of Donald Trump's friends who arrive at his private club in Florida in their newest [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=411.97999999999996s)]
*  Mercedes or their newest Range Rover has, according to Donald Trump, just lost hundreds [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=416.7s)]
*  of thousands of dollars by buying that car. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=422.41999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump has always thought, apparently, that paying bills is losing money. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=425.7s)]
*  That's why it's always been very difficult for people doing business with Donald Trump [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=430.46s)]
*  to get him to pay what he owes them. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=433.54s)]
*  But according to Donald Trump's own economic theory of losing money, every time Donald [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=436.42s)]
*  Trump actually bought and paid for something, like a building, he lost money. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=441.34s)]
*  That is his very stupid economic theory of international trade. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=448.38s)]
*  If I buy a Ford made in the United States, I haven't lost money. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=452.88s)]
*  But if I buy a Kia made in South Korea, I have lost money, even if the Kia is cheaper [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=458.7s)]
*  than the Ford. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=466.3s)]
*  What Donald Trump isn't capable of understanding is that at the end of that transaction, my [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=467.9s)]
*  life is richer now because I have a car, which I did not have before I paid for that car. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=473.09999999999997s)]
*  And now my kids can get to the soccer game and they can bring their friends with them. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=480.21999999999997s)]
*  And there will be a lifetime of memories made because we own that car. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=484.02s)]
*  It's going to take us to new places in our lives. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=489.18s)]
*  We didn't lose the money by buying a car. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=493.2s)]
*  According to Donald Trump, if you pay for something, you have lost money. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=497.9s)]
*  That's his understanding of economics. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=502.38s)]
*  And so every time Donald Trump says, we were losing hundreds of billions of dollars with [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=503.97999999999996s)]
*  China, every word of that is a lie. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=508.34s)]
*  We have never lost a penny in international trade. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=510.86s)]
*  The only way we could lose money is if we don't get the product that we paid for. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=514.54s)]
*  And that doesn't happen. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=519.22s)]
*  That's not how international trade works. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=520.86s)]
*  Because our system of international trade is, in fact, so reliable, so productive, and [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=523.24s)]
*  has made the world so productive, and has made this country more productive, and has [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=528.0600000000001s)]
*  made this country much richer than it was going to be if it ever had tried to remain [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=532.5s)]
*  an isolationist economic island in the middle of the world that was thriving in international [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=537.94s)]
*  trade. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=543.5s)]
*  The rest of the world would be thriving in international trade. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=544.5s)]
*  Donald Trump may have noticed that the nickname he got on this program last week, Donnie Two [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=546.46s)]
*  Dolls, after he said the stupidest thing any president of the United States has ever said [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=552.2600000000001s)]
*  about Christmas or dolls. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=557.62s)]
*  Donald Trump apparently realizes how very stupid it was for him to say last week that [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=559.1400000000001s)]
*  little girls should just get used to having two dolls instead of 30 dolls that he imagines [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=564.84s)]
*  them all to have, since almost all of the dolls sold in the United States are made in [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=569.88s)]
*  China. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=576.24s)]
*  Kristen Welker began the interview with that, and Donald Trump once again admitted that [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=577.4s)]
*  his tariffs are going to make prices go up, especially the price of dolls. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=583.12s)]
*  I'm going to quote what you said. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=591.28s)]
*  Maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, and maybe the two dolls will [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=594.4s)]
*  cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=598.68s)]
*  Are you saying that your tariffs will cause some prices to go up? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=601.88s)]
*  No, I think the tariffs are going to be great for us because it's going to make us rich. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=606.04s)]
*  But you said some dolls are going to cost more. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=609.52s)]
*  Isn't that an... [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=611.48s)]
*  Sure. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=613.48s)]
*  Some dolls are going to cost more. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=614.48s)]
*  Sure. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=616.48s)]
*  That was something Donald Trump never admitted on the campaign trail when he lied about tariffs [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=617.48s)]
*  every time he spoke about them. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=621.64s)]
*  And now, every time Donald Trump talks about tariffs, he sounds stupider than the time [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=623.84s)]
*  before. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=627.8000000000001s)]
*  This time, in a line worthy of a mental competency exam, Donald Trump talked about a beautiful [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=628.8000000000001s)]
*  baby girl who he then said is 11 years old. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=634.74s)]
*  Donald Trump is the only president in history who has decided exactly how many dolls a beautiful [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=639.72s)]
*  baby girl or an 11-year-old girl needs or should ever have. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=646.6s)]
*  And while he's at it, he's decided how many pencils kids should have. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=652.32s)]
*  Here's Donald Trump trying desperately to sound smarter than last week's Donnie Two [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=657.8000000000001s)]
*  dolls who said the very stupid thing about dolls last week. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=663.6800000000001s)]
*  And he ends up sounding somewhere far beyond very stupid once again. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=669.04s)]
*  I don't think a beautiful baby girl that's 11 years old needs to have 30 dolls. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=677.56s)]
*  I think they can have three dolls or four dolls because what we were doing with China [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=684.8s)]
*  was just unbelievable. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=689.88s)]
*  We had a trade deficit of hundreds of billions of dollars with China. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=691.12s)]
*  You say they could have three dolls instead of 30 dolls. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=695.94s)]
*  Are you saying Americans could see empty store shelves? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=699.0200000000001s)]
*  No, I'm not saying that. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=702.74s)]
*  I'm just saying they don't need to have 30 dolls. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=704.62s)]
*  They can have three. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=706.7800000000001s)]
*  They don't need to have 250 pencils. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=707.7800000000001s)]
*  They can have five. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=709.62s)]
*  So in Donald Trump's new math, the price increases are going to be so high that the amount of [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=711.62s)]
*  money that used to buy you 30 dolls before the Trump tariffs will now only buy you three. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=717.1s)]
*  Donald Trump is saying that he's going to drive prices up by a factor of 10. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=725.74s)]
*  And maybe the Trump kids have 250 pencils each, but I don't know anyone else who did. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=731.74s)]
*  But I also know I couldn't possibly have gotten through a single grade of St. Brendan's Elementary [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=737.9s)]
*  School with only five pencils a year. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=742.9s)]
*  If that's what he means, do I get five pencils for my entire elementary school years or is [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=745.68s)]
*  it five a year? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=750.1999999999999s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=751.38s)]
*  The mastermind of the last Republican president, George W. Bush's election and reelection, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=753.42s)]
*  Karl Rove, believes that Donald Trump becoming President Scrooge with 233 shopping days left [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=758.9599999999999s)]
*  before Christmas is very stupid and uniquely Trumpian stupid politics. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=766.52s)]
*  I thought it was really problematic when he said, well, you know what, the kids, those [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=774.4s)]
*  little girls at Christmas, they don't need 30 dolls. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=778.48s)]
*  They can do it too. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=780.8000000000001s)]
*  And if they have to pay a couple more bucks for them, you know, OK, well, it sounds like [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=781.8000000000001s)]
*  Mr. Scrooge and the ordinary American is like, wait a minute, I thought you were on my side. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=785.04s)]
*  I didn't think you were on the side of saying I need to do with less. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=790.8000000000001s)]
*  You've got plenty of money. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=794.8000000000001s)]
*  I got to make mine stretch as far as I can. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=795.92s)]
*  Ninety-four-year-old Warren Buffett, who knows more about business and investing and economics [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=799.24s)]
*  than Donald Trump ever will. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=803.88s)]
*  Warren Buffett, the self-made billionaire who was not born rich like Donald Trump, told [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=805.96s)]
*  his Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting in Omaha, Nebraska this weekend just how destructive [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=811.72s)]
*  Donald Trump is without ever saying the word Trump. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=818.08s)]
*  There is no question that trade can be an act of war. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=823.6s)]
*  And I think it's led to bad things. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=832.88s)]
*  Just the attitudes it's brought out. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=836.16s)]
*  In the United States, I mean, we should be looking to trade with the rest of the world, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=842.52s)]
*  and we should do what we do best, and they should do what they do best. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=846.32s)]
*  I do not think it's a great idea to try and design a world where a few countries say, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=849.64s)]
*  We've won, and other countries are envious. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=856.28s)]
*  That product sitting in front of Warren Buffett there, Coca-Cola, one of the huge beneficiaries [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=869.28s)]
*  of international trade, something Donald Trump doesn't understand. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=875.4399999999999s)]
*  That was a largely Republican audience in Omaha, Nebraska, of serious investors applauding [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=878.92s)]
*  what Warren Buffett had to say about Donald Trump's insane trade war. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=886.6s)]
*  Donald Trump's latest utter insanity on tariffs is about movies. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=890.76s)]
*  In a social media post yesterday, Donald Trump said, I am authorizing the Department of Commerce [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=895.96s)]
*  and the United States Trade Representative to immediately begin the process of instituting [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=900.2s)]
*  a 100% tariff on any and all movies coming into our country that are produced in foreign [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=903.72s)]
*  lands. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=909.2800000000001s)]
*  Now, that will never happen. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=910.2800000000001s)]
*  It will allow for some interesting, fun TV interviews, I suppose, people from Hollywood [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=913.04s)]
*  who might be concerned about this, people in show business, but it is a complete waste [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=918.38s)]
*  of your time to even think about that very, very stupid statement by the President of [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=922.4399999999999s)]
*  the United States. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=927.64s)]
*  No one at the Department of Commerce or the United States Trade Representative will even [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=928.92s)]
*  attempt to put that crazy idea in writing because it is impossible to put it in legal [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=934.32s)]
*  language for any purpose of a tariff. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=943.4000000000001s)]
*  It is one of those idiotic Trump ideas that requires a depth of stupidity in its authorship [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=946.36s)]
*  that no one else in the history of American government possessed other than Donald Trump. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=951.12s)]
*  Donald Trump's justification for this tariff idea on movies that will never be put in writing [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=956.6s)]
*  is that movies not made in the United States are, are you ready for this? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=963.76s)]
*  I think we can all say this together by now, a national security threat. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=969.68s)]
*  Those are Donald Trump's words. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=975.3s)]
*  Movies are, according to Donald Trump, quote, a national security threat. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=977.34s)]
*  Dolls are a national security threat. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=983.08s)]
*  Washing machines are a national security threat. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=986.48s)]
*  The President of the United States believes all of those things are national security [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=990.02s)]
*  threats and the President does have an extremely limited authority to impose tariffs in response [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=993.86s)]
*  to a product that presents a national security threat to the United States. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=999.94s)]
*  That's why he's calling movies a national security threat. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=1006.74s)]
*  The Trump movie tariff is so insane that it will never even find its way into a federal [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=1011.2s)]
*  courtroom to be struck down instantaneously as it would because it is impossible to even [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=1017.7s)]
*  write it. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=1024.46s)]
*  Even the most sycophantic Trump clowns working for him to try to put that idiocy into legal [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=1025.46s)]
*  language even for them is impossible. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=1030.26s)]
*  So Hollywood can relax. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=1032.1200000000001s)]
*  Movie theater operators don't have to worry. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=1033.98s)]
*  Movie goers and movie watchers, there's nothing to see here. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=1036.02s)]
*  It's just more Trumpian nonsense. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=1039.4s)]
*  Ever before in the immediate aftermath of the death of a pope, have American politicians [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=1042.68s)]
*  thought that the pope's death is an opportunity for fun, a time to publicly make jokes about [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=1048.66s)]
*  it? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=1056.44s)]
*  Sure, plenty of people make jokes about popes, including jokes about popes dying. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=1057.44s)]
*  Comedians, that's who does that. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=1062.2s)]
*  Anyone can do that. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=1064.8s)]
*  But politicians don't because politicians are careful people. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=1065.8s)]
*  They don't want to offend anyone. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=1069.98s)]
*  They're not funny people. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=1072.44s)]
*  Politicians are not comedians and they're not good at comedy and Republicans are proving [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=1074.48s)]
*  that in a totally new arena of what is now exclusively Republican comedy and that is [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=1078.78s)]
*  making jokes about the pope and the papacy. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=1085.18s)]
*  Here's a couple of right-wing Republican Catholics playing in the comedic field opened to them, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=1090.1200000000001s)]
*  to their glee, by the death of a pope. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=1097.82s)]
*  Now, our next vice president, JD Vance, actually was very funny, remarking, quote, I think [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=1103.52s)]
*  he could take on a bit more. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=1108.6399999999999s)]
*  If only there was a job opening for a devout Catholic. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=1110.52s)]
*  When does conclave start? [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=1113.8999999999999s)]

*  Is secretary of state Marco Rubio? [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=1116.76s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, you got to admit that was pretty funny. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=1119.24s)]
*  I like that. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypky5SEoEJQ&t=1122.3999999999999s)]
