# EXCLUSIVE: Rep. McIver speaks out on federal charges after ICE center confrontation
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ)
*  Joining me now to discuss the federal criminal charges against her, filed by Trump's handpicked [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=0.0s)]
*  U.S. attorney for the state of New Jersey, who I just talked about, is Congresswoman [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=5.54s)]
*  LaMonica MacGyver. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=9.620000000000001s)]
*  Congresswoman, it's great to see you. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=10.620000000000001s)]
*  I know you have had a hell of a couple of weeks. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=12.540000000000001s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=15.58s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=16.580000000000002s)]
*  Thank you so much, Jen, for having me, for allowing me to come on and talk about the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=17.580000000000002s)]
*  facts of this case. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=20.22s)]
*  Of course. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=21.3s)]
*  I was just watching as I was preparing to talk to you today, back to some of the interviews [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=22.3s)]
*  on the day that all of this happened. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=27.1s)]
*  At the time, you described it, and so did your colleagues who are with you, as being [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=29.56s)]
*  assaulted by multiple ICE agents. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=34.5s)]
*  Is that part of the argument that you want to make now and that you plan to make in court [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=38.14s)]
*  as you proceed here? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=42.44s)]
*  So I definitely plan on making that argument in court. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=44.44s)]
*  I can't wait to have my day in court, you know, where we can have due process, which [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  this administration has stripped many of being able to have due process. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=52.04s)]
*  And I'm looking forward to that, to telling the truth about what happened on that day. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=56.3s)]
*  When you look back at video, I'm sure you were just digesting it all in the moment when [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=61.16s)]
*  you were doing all those interviews that day. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=65.08s)]
*  You've probably talked to your colleagues. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=66.64s)]
*  As you've pieced together what happened, I mean, did you even know who you were surrounded [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=68.52s)]
*  by at the time? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=72.4s)]
*  It was fast. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=74.24s)]
*  It happened so fast. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=75.4s)]
*  I mean, I was just talking about this with Rep Bonnie Watson the other day. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=76.4s)]
*  We were on a segment together and we were playing the video back and we were just talking [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=80.32s)]
*  about how it was so disheartening to see that, to see that episode. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=85.22s)]
*  It was a very tense situation. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=88.7s)]
*  We were trying to ask questions, trying to get explanation from the officials that were [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=90.86s)]
*  there and it was just so chaotic. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=95.89999999999999s)]
*  And ICE and Homeland Security definitely escalated the situation, caused the chaos and the confrontation. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=97.82s)]
*  And it just was so unnecessary. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=104.0s)]
*  So it was really hard to play the videos back. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  It's very hard to watch, especially when we're just showing up to do our jobs, you know, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=107.69999999999999s)]
*  an oversight visit that should have been simple. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=111.62s)]
*  Also, I would just state anybody can show up. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=114.1s)]
*  You have this right as a member of Congress to an ICE facility to conduct oversight. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=116.44s)]
*  Without an appointment. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  Without an appointment. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=122.03999999999999s)]
*  Now, after the scrum outside that we just saw that you have been charged with assault [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  over, you did a tour of the ICE facility. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  Were any of the same people that you recognize from the scrum a part of that tour? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=132.28s)]
*  The same people were there. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=135.95999999999998s)]
*  The same people. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=137.2s)]
*  It was the same people. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=138.2s)]
*  officials come there. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=140.2s)]
*  The ICE regional director for that area came along with many of his cabinet members. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=141.76s)]
*  They were there, if that's what you call them. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=147.38s)]
*  They came, they took the entire tour with us after that whole situation happened. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=149.73999999999998s)]
*  I mean, it literally offered us a soda at that too. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=154.89999999999998s)]
*  But whole tour, we were able to walk the facility. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=158.67999999999998s)]
*  We even got stuck in the elevator in the process, which once again, that was one of the things [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=160.98s)]
*  that the mayor of Newark in the city claimed that they didn't have an inspection for. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=165.54s)]
*  The elevator. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=168.98s)]
*  We also were able to talk to detainees who told us that they were just very confused. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=170.2s)]
*  They didn't know what was going on. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=174.92s)]
*  It's been days since they had a phone call, since they talked to legal representation, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=176.6s)]
*  which is a problem. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=181.32s)]
*  You know, most of the folks we spoke to just were like, we wish we could have a phone call [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=182.32s)]
*  or someone would tell us what is going on right now. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=186.76s)]
*  We just don't understand what is happening. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=189.04s)]
*  And so yeah, I've had a full tour. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=191.2s)]
*  It's with the same people. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=193.72s)]
*  I'm just going to restate because I think that's a bit mind blowing given where we are. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=194.98000000000002s)]
*  I mentioned this in the opening of the show that the Justice Department has a public integrity [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=199.02s)]
*  section that always has to typically approve if there are charges that are going to be [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=204.26000000000002s)]
*  filed against a member of Congress or an elected official. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=209.46s)]
*  And sometimes those are warranted. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=212.54000000000002s)]
*  They did not do that in this case, according to NBC reporting, which I don't know if you [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=214.46s)]
*  just learned that today, but what is your reaction to that? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=218.98000000000002s)]
*  I mean, it's not shocking. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=222.02s)]
*  We've been seeing from this administration constant, you know, breaking of the rules, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=223.64000000000001s)]
*  constant breaking of the process, constant disregard to the Constitution. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=228.48000000000002s)]
*  We've seen it all, you know. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=232.6s)]
*  And so I try not to always say when I came into this job in September, believe it or [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=234.0s)]
*  not, it's only been since September. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  It feels like it's been 20 years. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=240.08s)]
*  But once January 20th came, it was just like, hey, try not to be surprised by some of the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=241.72s)]
*  things that they do because they're so outrageous. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=245.96s)]
*  And so to see them, you know, disregarding process as usual, it's just it's a regular [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=249.64s)]
*  day in the Trump administration of the things that they do. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=254.98s)]
*  You were charged by Alina Haba. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=259.14s)]
*  I just gave a little bit of an overview, though. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=261.06s)]
*  There she has quite a history. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=263.26s)]
*  Do you think you would have been charged if it had been any other U.S. attorney in this [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=265.38s)]
*  in this role? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=269.02s)]
*  I mean, I don't think so. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=270.02s)]
*  I mean, that's I don't want to speculate. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=271.5s)]
*  I mean, I think anyone that Trump, you know, promotes or appoints, I mean, I think they've [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=273.3s)]
*  been problematic from every department you can think of. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=278.94s)]
*  So I wouldn't say it wouldn't happen. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=282.48s)]
*  But I just it's it's crazy because there's so many other crimes and things to be focused [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=284.56s)]
*  on and definitely not to be focused on a congresswoman or congress members who were there just to [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=288.54s)]
*  do an oversight visit. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=294.72s)]
*  We were not there to bust detainees out of prison. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=295.84s)]
*  We've heard that come out from the DOJ. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=299.46s)]
*  We were there for an oversight visit. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=301.6s)]
*  And Jen, this is something that we've done before. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=303.52s)]
*  We were just a couple of weeks ago back in February, we were at a same kind of detention [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=305.48s)]
*  center in Elizabeth, a couple of miles away, and we went there different providers, third [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=310.22s)]
*  party provider. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=315.1s)]
*  But we were there, had a visit. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=316.1s)]
*  There was a little delay, but we still were able to go in and do our visit. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=318.02000000000004s)]
*  We didn't have a whole, you know, ice unit come and create a chaos situation for us to [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=320.74s)]
*  take a visit. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=327.66s)]
*  This is something that we're used to doing. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=328.66s)]
*  We've done it before. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=330.06s)]
*  And so we had no idea that it was spiral out of this. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=331.3s)]
*  I just think there are so many other important things for Alina to be focused on that she [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=334.12s)]
*  should be focused on rather than trying to stop, you know, congress members for doing [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=338.8s)]
*  their jobs. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=342.20000000000005s)]
*  No question about it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=343.48s)]
*  Lots happening in every state. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=344.8s)]
*  You said this morning that, well, Haba said you had declined every opportunity to come [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=346.48s)]
*  to a resolution. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=351.26000000000005s)]
*  You said they wanted you to admit to something you didn't do. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=352.26000000000005s)]
*  What did they want you to admit to? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=355.16s)]
*  I mean, there was a lot. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=356.56s)]
*  We've had a week of back and forth with them. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=357.72s)]
*  And I will say that I did not waver. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=360.0s)]
*  I showed up there to do my job and she wanted me to admit to doing things. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=362.14s)]
*  All of these different lists of things that she said that I did. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=367.06s)]
*  Like what? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=369.7s)]
*  I mean, from things of impeding, you know, there were some other things in there that [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=370.7s)]
*  she put in there, but I can't remember exactly what it was. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=376.02s)]
*  But she wanted me to admit to these things, sign an agreement to them. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=378.74s)]
*  And I'm not doing that, you know, because it's not true. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=382.38s)]
*  I mean, there was a lot of back and forth and just tenseness, you know, all week from [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=385.1s)]
*  her and from her office. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=389.54s)]
*  And so at the end of the day, once again, showed up to do my job. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=391.32s)]
*  And I don't need to apologize for doing that. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=394.28000000000003s)]
*  That is what the people of New Jersey expect for me to do. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=396.52000000000004s)]
*  The seven hundred and forty four thousand, almost close to eight hundred thousand people [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=398.96000000000004s)]
*  I represent. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=402.76s)]
*  And why should we apologize about doing our job when ICE and Homeland Security created [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=403.76s)]
*  that environment and that atmosphere that we saw out there that day? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=408.36s)]
*  I think part of one of the reasons I wanted to talk to you is there's so much disinformation [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=412.28000000000003s)]
*  out there. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=415.6s)]
*  I want to play something that Tom Homan said earlier today on our air, which has a lot [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=416.6s)]
*  of disinformation on it. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=420.72s)]
*  But I want to talk to you about it. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=421.72s)]
*  You say she has a right to do oversight, but there's a right way to do it. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=425.14000000000004s)]
*  Forcing yourself to officers to get in that facility is not the way to do it. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=429.02000000000004s)]
*  They we do it. We have many Congress visit our facility. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=434.02000000000004s)]
*  What she did was unprofessional. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=437.5s)]
*  He keeps using the word unprofessional. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=440.34000000000003s)]
*  So I wonder what you think of that. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=442.3s)]
*  But I also want to just ask you, there's a lot of inaccuracies in there. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=443.34000000000003s)]
*  I want to give you a chance to tell everybody what all the inaccuracies are. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=446.70000000000005s)]
*  Absolutely. First of all, number one, we can show up to any facility, any ice facility [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=449.84s)]
*  unannounced. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=454.76s)]
*  We like to come unannounced because we want to see the conditions in the state that they [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=455.76s)]
*  are not with a planned visit where they have time to fix up anything or, you know, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=459.0s)]
*  can her course anything of a visit. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=463.2s)]
*  So we can do that. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=466.08s)]
*  We can show up. Secondly, you know, push our way through like no. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=467.23999999999995s)]
*  Before that whole situation occurred, we were inside of this facility waiting for over [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=472.64s)]
*  an hour for ice administrators to get there to take us on this tour. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=478.4s)]
*  We were also there with the GEO, which is the prison, the private prison company that [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=482.65999999999997s)]
*  runs this location, who we were talking with, the person who was in charge of the facility, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=487.58s)]
*  who was actually lovely, by the way, he was providing us with great information. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=491.65999999999997s)]
*  He was like, hey, I would love to give you guys a tour, but we have to wait on ice because [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=495.78s)]
*  they said that I can't. So at the end of the day, we're waiting over an hour for them, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=499.7s)]
*  you know, to come. We didn't bust our way through. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=503.46s)]
*  We didn't do any of that. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=505.82s)]
*  We were invited there, waiting there for them to come and give us a tour. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=507.24s)]
*  And afterwards, we see them come and they're like rushing to focus on the mayor of [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=511.24s)]
*  Newark, which we're like, what is going on here? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=515.3199999999999s)]
*  We're just here for our tour. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=517.92s)]
*  Why are you going out here to deal with this situation? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=519.24s)]
*  So at the end of the day, I mean, everything that he's saying, he doesn't have the facts. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=521.92s)]
*  I mean, it's just so much disconnect, I think, between all of their departments and [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=525.48s)]
*  their leadership. They're not on the same page and unprofessional. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=529.24s)]
*  No, it's unprofessional for us to have to go through that. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=532.68s)]
*  I think when three members of Congress show up to your gate, you should have some [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=535.9399999999999s)]
*  respect and have some professionalism with them. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=540.02s)]
*  But this is this administration. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=542.14s)]
*  There is no basic governing respect or character with this administration. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=544.3s)]
*  Things are just rogue. They're doing whatever they want to do. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=550.18s)]
*  I mean, just not even a basic conversation. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=553.06s)]
*  I think about coming from city council and how I used to work with colleagues and we [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=554.9799999999999s)]
*  would disagree, but we would still show up professional, both of us, to be able to [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=558.26s)]
*  perform for the people that we represent. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=563.06s)]
*  And it's just not there. The same, you know, professionalism is not there. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=564.86s)]
*  So I find it like kind of, you know, it's silly and honestly outrageous for, you know, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=568.14s)]
*  him to call me unprofessional when they created this unprofessional situation. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=572.98s)]
*  Congresswoman MacGyver, thank you so much for joining me. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=577.98s)]
*  I know we have daughters the same age. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=580.9s)]
*  I'm sure they're she's very proud of you. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=582.74s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you for being here. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myaQZiI6CqQ&t=584.9399999999999s)]
