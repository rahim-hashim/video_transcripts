# Bombshell new report on Musk’s ‘intense’ use of ketamine, other drugs
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU)
*  It's kind of a rough last day in government for Elon Musk, who showed up to the Oval Office for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=0.0s)]
*  some kind of send-off with a black eye just hours after new bombshell reporting on allegations of [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=4.32s)]
*  his voracious drug use. In a lengthy article citing people familiar with his activities, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  The New York Times reports that Musk's drug consumption went well beyond occasional use. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=16.48s)]
*  He told people he was taking so much ketamine, a powerful anesthetic, that it was affecting his [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  bladder, a known effect of chronic use. I learned that today from the New York Times, didn't know [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=27.76s)]
*  that. He took ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms and he traveled with a daily medication box that [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=32.24s)]
*  held about 20 pills, including ones with the markings of the stimulant Adderall, according to [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=38.32s)]
*  a photo of the box and people who have seen it. The Times adds that while his drug use on the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=43.92s)]
*  campaign trail was more than occasional, it is unclear whether he was taking drugs when he became [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=48.8s)]
*  a fixture at the White House this year. Now, NBC News does not independently verify the Times [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=53.84s)]
*  reporting, but when NBC asked the White House if it sought drug testing for Musk before his [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=59.28s)]
*  government employment began, the White House did not directly respond. Musk was asked about the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=63.92s)]
*  reporting today in the Oval, jumping in before the question was even done. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=69.12s)]
*  There is a New York Times report today that accuses you of blurring the line between... [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=84.64s)]
*  Is the New York Times, is that the same publication that's got a Pulitzer Prize [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=89.36s)]
*  for false reporting on the Russiagate? Is it the same organization? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=95.36s)]
*  I gotta check my Pulitzer counter. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=100.48s)]
*  I think the judge just ruled against New York Times for their lies about the Russiagate hoax, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=104.72s)]
*  and that they might have to give back that Pulitzer Prize. That New York Times, let's move on. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=110.8s)]
*  Okay, then next question. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=115.84s)]
*  For the record, the Pulitzer of the Times one has not been rescinded, and it was about the Trump-Russia [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=118.16s)]
*  connection. A judge ruled that Trump's defamation suit against the Pulitzer board overwards given [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=122.96s)]
*  to coverage of Russian interference in 2016 election can proceed, but that's all. Teddy [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  Schleifer covers billionaires for the Times. He's covered Elon Musk extensively, and he joins me now. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=132.8s)]
*  Teddy, I know it was your two colleagues that put this piece out today. You've been doing a [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=138.48s)]
*  lot of reporting on Musk and know him well and reported on him. I gotta say, it was kind of... [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=142.32s)]
*  Well, it was one jaw-dropping revelation after another, and I just kept on waiting. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=148.64s)]
*  This guy's life seems like a lot between... There are multiple custody battles over children [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=152.32s)]
*  with multiple women. There seems to be, according to the Times reporting, a very significant amount [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=160.39999999999998s)]
*  of drug use that even disturbed people in his life, and he's got like 10 jobs, I guess? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=166.88s)]
*  Yeah, and then there's the black eye, Chris. We can't forget that Elon took from one of those [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=173.2s)]
*  kids, apparently. Look, he has obviously a sprawling social life, and the reason why I think it matters [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=178.07999999999998s)]
*  for viewers or for Donald Trump or for Tesla or SpaceX shareholders is these companies are really [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=187.51999999999998s)]
*  the Elon Musk show. As we saw with Doge, it is the Elon Musk show. As we see with Tesla, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=194.16000000000003s)]
*  a lot of people buy stock in Tesla because they believe in Elon Musk's. So his personal life [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=200.08s)]
*  is very much commingled with his corporate life, and it's impossible to assess Elon's [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=206.32000000000002s)]
*  ability to lead these companies if you don't know things about how many drugs he is doing. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=213.28s)]
*  I mean, there's also just... Independent reporting. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=217.76000000000002s)]
*  None of the... There's a little bit of like a common sense alarm that goes off in my head [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=221.76000000000002s)]
*  about the following. This is an individual who has five or six companies he's running, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=227.28s)]
*  right? The Boring Company and Neuralink and Tesla and SpaceX, and he's also running this operation [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=233.28s)]
*  of the government. He's got a video game system installed in the office that he gets the EOB [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=241.44s)]
*  while he's apparently taking a lot of drugs and is managing a private life that involves [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=247.84s)]
*  over a dozen children with multiple women. At a certain point, he starts to feel like, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=253.76s)]
*  can he really be doing all this actually? Well, I mean, there's been some credible reporting [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=258.16s)]
*  that he's not even really playing the video games, so I think that's an important caveat here on the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=264.8s)]
*  Elon Musk resume. That would be the most damaging thing I say today. But look, Musk clearly is a [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=270.32s)]
*  believer that there's a... In the Messiah complex here, right? The reason why he got involved [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=276.8s)]
*  in the Trump campaign is because he believed that he could save Western civilization from the [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=281.84000000000003s)]
*  problems of illegal immigration and crime, and only he can fix it. He even said that if he lost [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=288.0s)]
*  in Wisconsin in that judicial race earlier this year, that American Western civilization would [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=294.72s)]
*  crumble. The reason why he is so overextended, I think, is related to the way he sees his role [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=300.64s)]
*  in the world, which is if I don't create Tesla, no one's going to create Tesla. If I don't create [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=307.76s)]
*  XAI, no one's going to create XAI. And if I don't save America from crippling deficits and debt, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=311.91999999999996s)]
*  then Donald Trump is cooked. So the reason why he is, in fact, having so many children based on [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=319.03999999999996s)]
*  our reporting is in part because of this belief that he is the type of person who should continue [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=326.08s)]
*  to populate the world. So these things are not just coincidental. He is doing all these things [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=332.15999999999997s)]
*  motivated by a core belief in his own power. There's a really interesting nugget in this [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=337.52s)]
*  reporting that speaks to what I think is sort of a scandal, at least as alleged, that Mr. Musk's [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=344.56s)]
*  aerospace firm SpaceX is a large government contractor. It must maintain a drug-free [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=353.36s)]
*  workforce, which by the way is a program I have some real policy objections to. It administers [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=358.16s)]
*  random drug tests to its employees, but Mr. Musk has received advanced warning of the tests. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=362.8s)]
*  According to people close to the process, SpaceX did not respond to questions about those warnings. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=368.08000000000004s)]
*  That's a pretty notable find in the reporting there. Yeah, I mean, my colleagues, Kirsten and [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=373.52000000000004s)]
*  Megan did a great job of excavating that fact. And obviously that would be true even if Elon Musk [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=380.0s)]
*  was not at the Department of Government Efficiency. I mean, he is going to be going back to SpaceX [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=385.84s)]
*  today or tomorrow or maybe he's already there. And you would think that if SpaceX read this [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=391.52s)]
*  New York Times story, their policies might change, but maybe not. SpaceX, by the way, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=397.76s)]
*  we should say in the new budget, some of the details of which we got further today, later in [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=402.56s)]
*  the day, would likely stand to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of enormous cuts to NASA [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=408.08s)]
*  that are being proposed by Donald Trump. As Elon Musk goes out the door, just one of the many obvious [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=413.52s)]
*  conflicts, probably the biggest in terms of government contracts with Elon Musk and the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=418.4s)]
*  government, Teddy Schleifer, New York Times. Thank you so much. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJsewjIl8qU&t=423.12s)]
