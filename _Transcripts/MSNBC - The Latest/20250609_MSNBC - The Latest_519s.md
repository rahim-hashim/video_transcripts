Video Description: Members of the California National Guard have arrived in Los Angeles Sunday morning in response to days of protest against federal immigration raids. On Saturday, President Donald Trump moved to deploy the 2,000 members over the opposition of California Gov. Gavin Newsom and L.A. Mayor Karen Bass, who say the move is inflammatory and unnecessary. California Congressman Jimmy Gomez, whose district is in Los Angeles, spoke out about the move and much more.

# 'They talk about the chaos in L.A. This is a lawless administration': Congressman
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE)
*  Joining me now we have California Congressman Jimmy Gomez. He's a member of the Intelligence and Ways and Means committees. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=0.0s)]
*  Congressman, welcome to you. What is your response to the president ordering California National Guard troops to assist the handling of demonstrations? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=5.92s)]
*  I mean, Governor Gavin Newsom said the president made the move because he wants a spectacle and it's only going to escalate tensions. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=13.58s)]
*  Is he right? Are you concerned that any standoff between [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=21.04s)]
*  uniformed officers and protesters will lead to more violence? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=25.44s)]
*  Yeah, I'm extremely concerned. I agree with the governor. This is something that President Trump, his advisor Stephen Miller, had always had in mind. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=30.16s)]
*  Is this confrontation between California and their federal government? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=38.72s)]
*  We have, I've heard from people that used to work in the DOD that this was just a matter of time before this happened, and this is the perfect opportunity for him to federalize the National Guard without the authorization of the California governor. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=43.84s)]
*  So on Friday, you may have heard me asking David Norgay about this. We understand that you and other California members of Congress were barred from entering the downtown L.A. federal courthouse where the immigrants are believed to be held. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=57.72s)]
*  What happened when you tried to go inside and what were you told about how many people are being detained there and what the conditions are like? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=69.88s)]
*  Yeah, I want to be clear that I specifically chose an early hour, 830 in the morning, to visit the detention center because I didn't want to hear that, oh, there's too many protesters or too many people, things are not safe. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=78.39999999999999s)]
*  So we went specifically early in the morning and we presented ourselves like we're supposed to, shored my congressional ID card saying I'm a member of Congress under this law. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  I have a right to inspect the facility. They actually ignored the call. I actually spoke to the Congressional Affairs Liaison. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=101.04s)]
*  They said they were working on it, and then I got called to the side and spoke to somebody from I'm assuming that was ICE or Department Homeland Security, and they said because of the safety issues, we weren't going to be allowed inside. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=110.76s)]
*  Well, it doesn't matter what's going on, number one. Number two, we also know that there was nobody there. It was four members of Congress, the press and a few attorneys. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=122.64s)]
*  So the idea that it's not safe is just complete nonsense and unacceptable. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=132.76s)]
*  And was there any indication of what the conditions are like inside? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, so I heard the day a few days before, and that's why I was there, that people were being arrested when they were being going through ICE check ins that they were experiencing overcrowding there. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=142.24s)]
*  We have members that was with us, Norma Torres, who had already turned the facility in March. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  That was it has a capacity about 100 people. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=157.8s)]
*  It's only supposed to be a short term holding facility for 12 hours. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=160.56s)]
*  People were there for over 24 hours and that they were way above the 100 person capacity. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=164.88000000000002s)]
*  So we were concerned that they weren't getting fed. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=169.88s)]
*  They weren't having a place to sleep, that they weren't getting the medicine if they actually had medication. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=172.04s)]
*  We saw somebody there show up to provide medication that her dad needed and they weren't allowing her in. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=176.56s)]
*  So those are the kind of things that we wanted to see for ourselves. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=183.04s)]
*  So there are two tracks, as David was outlining for the viewers here. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=186.96s)]
*  There's you, the congressional members there, and you were denied access despite that card and legally you being allowed to access and inspect something on any sort of notice. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=192.2s)]
*  And then there are returnees that were also being denied to see clients or those who they presume they're going to represent, even get in to speak to them. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=203.12s)]
*  Can you speak to that? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=213.2s)]
*  Yeah, so the attorney started being denied access on Friday. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=215.48s)]
*  That's why I went with them on Saturday morning and they canceled all the attorney appointments and then they canceled any family visitation. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=219.4s)]
*  That is completely unacceptable because one of the things we know is that this is a facility that they can ship people out. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=227.96s)]
*  They'll try to pressure them for expedited removal, sign this paperwork and then especially if they're of Mexican descent, get them back over the border quickly. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=233.76s)]
*  So they're being denied representation, number one, for their due process rights, which they have. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=242.24s)]
*  And then the members of Congress were denied because we wanted to exercise our oversight authority as members of Congress. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=248.72000000000003s)]
*  OK, but you've at least spoken to somebody. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=257.68s)]
*  We're told on Friday you went to Chinatown there near downtown L.A. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=260.44s)]
*  After getting a tip, if you want to call it that, from ICE and FBI agents that were staging a parking lot, staging, pardon me, at a parking lot there, the tip not coming from ICE and FBI. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=264.64000000000004s)]
*  But you spoke with some of those agents, so I'm curious what they told you and what you saw. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=275.24s)]
*  Yeah, so Assemblymember Mark Gonzalez is a friend of mine, lives in Chinatown, called me the minute I landed and asked me to come down because they weren't answering his question. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=280.56s)]
*  So I went to Chinatown, spoke to the FBI that was staging there, and they basically said that they weren't there to do any immigration or ICE, like any kind of enforcement, because that's what people were afraid of. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=289.44s)]
*  And more and more people were showing up. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=302.71999999999997s)]
*  I had this conversation. I said, this is not a good place to stage or only to escalate the situation. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=304.91999999999996s)]
*  And I said, you guys should move, go somewhere else. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=310.88s)]
*  You need to leave the area. So they were saying that they weren't there. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=313.67999999999995s)]
*  They were there only to protect the federal buildings, but they weren't close to the federal buildings. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=316.76s)]
*  So that was kind of a concern. But they ended up leaving. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=321.2s)]
*  There was some a little bit of kind of chaos going on with some of the protesters. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=324.48s)]
*  And you know what? Some of them, the protesters shouldn't do what they're doing. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=329.04s)]
*  They shouldn't antagonize these officers. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=333.28s)]
*  So we got them to leave and things diffused there for a second. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=336.2s)]
*  OK, but you're talking that happened Friday. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=339.76s)]
*  You went yesterday morning at eight, third in the morning to try to get into the detention center for oversight, as you were justly allowed. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=342.0s)]
*  What can you do now? How are you going to be able to get into where you want? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=348.79999999999995s)]
*  What about the attorneys who've been denied seeing potential clients? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=353.56s)]
*  What about the families that want to get in and see their loved ones? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=357.15999999999997s)]
*  How is this going to be resolved? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=360.4s)]
*  So we are going back again tomorrow to try to get back in. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=362.67999999999995s)]
*  And this is a during regular business hours. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=368.28s)]
*  They have the National Guard. So things should be, quote unquote, safer for me when I show up. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=370.6s)]
*  Additionally, but other members of Congress went to Adelanto today and were denied access. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=375.48s)]
*  So here's the thing. They talk about the chaos in L.A. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=380.76s)]
*  This is a lawless administration that's breaking not only federal law when it comes to members of Congress, but due process and the rights of individuals who are in this country. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=384.68s)]
*  This is the only way this works is if we actually abide by the law for everybody. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=394.96s)]
*  And they're not abiding by the law when it comes to the people that are held in detention or the checks and balances that should be in place to keep this from happening. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=400.36s)]
*  Let me ask you about the administration's return of Kilmer Albrego Garcia to the U.S. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=409.04s)]
*  where he faces federal charges over alleged human trafficking. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=414.2s)]
*  What is your response to these charges and what do you make of the administration's decision to bring him back after months of defying court orders to do so? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=417.6s)]
*  It just shows that they actually had the ability to bring them back. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=426.64s)]
*  Remember, oh, we can't bring him back. We don't have any ability. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=430.44s)]
*  They were able to do it. And that's because people stayed and pressured the administration to do it. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=432.88s)]
*  Even people on their own side, people that voted for Trump saying that this was an overreach because he was mistakenly deported. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=438.72s)]
*  Additionally, now they're trying to cherry pick. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=446.28000000000003s)]
*  OK, what can we charge him with? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=448.8s)]
*  What can we show that he is a criminal? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=450.28000000000003s)]
*  Remember, at first, it was because he was part of this Venezuelan gang and that the Venezuelan government was directing the infiltration of our country by these individuals, which was complete nonsense. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=453.96s)]
*  Even an FBI agent said that there was no connection, was then fired because he said that there's no connection. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=465.56s)]
*  So this administration is trying to come up with the justification to convict him and then send him back. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=471.84s)]
*  So it's got at least a partial win, in my opinion, by getting them back and having this process. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=479.64000000000004s)]
*  But he should never have been in there in the first place. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=485.6s)]
*  That's why you have due process. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=487.52000000000004s)]
*  So innocent people are not mistakenly punished. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=489.12s)]
*  And then they actually get to go through the court process and the process that respects their rights. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDVW0FZmjE&t=492.52000000000004s)]
