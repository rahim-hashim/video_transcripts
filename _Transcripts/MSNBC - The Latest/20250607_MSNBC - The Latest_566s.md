# Community during fascism: Actress Laverne Cox on the importance of WorldPride in Trump’s D.C.
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso)
*  Representative Robert Garcia is back with us, an actress and LGBTQ plus advocate Laverne [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=0.0s)]
*  Cox joins us now. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Laverne, how in this moment of all the things that we've been talking about, the attacks [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=7.88s)]
*  on the trans community, attacks on the queer community, why is it important to be celebrating [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=13.72s)]
*  World Pride? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=18.72s)]
*  Because there was a lot of conversation about whether or not folks should even come. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=19.72s)]
*  I mean, well, there are travel advisories around traveling to the United States. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=22.6s)]
*  And if so, if I were a person who lived outside the country, I wouldn't come here because [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=27.2s)]
*  it's not safe. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=33.16s)]
*  Secretary of State, God, it's so weird to say Secretary of State, Mark Rubio. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=36.16s)]
*  He there, you know, they're looking into people's visas and if their gender has been changed [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=40.4s)]
*  at some point, they're denying their, denying them entry into this country if they're not [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=47.04s)]
*  citizens. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  I wouldn't want to come. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=52.48s)]
*  But I think what I, what's really important for me to remind myself of and remind specifically [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=55.8s)]
*  my community and trans and non-binary people is that in historically in the face of state [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=62.959999999999994s)]
*  discrimination, we've always been able to rely on each other. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=69.47999999999999s)]
*  That is chosen family, mutual aid. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=72.92s)]
*  We have been criminalized before this. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  The Stonewall riots were riots, a rebellion against state sanctioned violence against [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=79.44s)]
*  our community. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=85.75999999999999s)]
*  And we fought back. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=86.75999999999999s)]
*  And we have their state sanctioned discrimination against us right now that we must fight there. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=87.96s)]
*  I don't have faith in our lawmakers. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=94.12s)]
*  There are some encouraging things happening in the courts, but we'll see. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=96.4s)]
*  But I think at the end of the day, we have to rely on each other because our government [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=102.44s)]
*  has been captured by corporations, special interest and fear. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=105.8s)]
*  So many Democrats and independents are capitulating and equivocating beforehand and not fighting. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=110.8s)]
*  The lack of fight when this is really a fascist regime. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=117.88s)]
*  And I think framing it in the context of fascism is really important because, and not in a [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=121.64s)]
*  hyperbolic way, but I'm specifically referring to Jason Stanley's work on fascism, how fascism [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=126.88s)]
*  works. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=132.76s)]
*  Let's take a look at the military ban. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=133.79999999999998s)]
*  First of all, the military is the largest employer of trans people in this country. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=134.79999999999998s)]
*  There's nothing, it has nothing to do with their ability to do their jobs. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=140.39999999999998s)]
*  So many trans people I've met over the years have gotten accommodations and then told they [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=144.92s)]
*  were told they have to leave just because they're trans. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=149.88s)]
*  And that's discrimination. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=153.48s)]
*  It's un-American. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=154.48s)]
*  It's disgusting. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=155.48s)]
*  But it's part of a larger fascistic agenda to take control and have that traditional [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=156.48s)]
*  in-group in power and everyone else on the outs. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=165.16s)]
*  Congressman, you know, we're talking about Pride Month and everything that Laverne said, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=168.39999999999998s)]
*  but I want to bring up the case of Andre Jose Hernandez Romero, who you have made a point [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=174.48s)]
*  of reminding people is still in El Salvador prison, we think, but I want to play for you [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=181.44000000000003s)]
*  what- [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=189.68s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=190.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=191.68s)]
*  I want to play for you what Pod Save America's John Lovett had to say about him. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=192.68s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=197.36s)]
*  They can send people back any time they want. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=198.36s)]
*  They can bring Andre back any time they f***ing want. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=203.96s)]
*  Christine Ohm, a mother, is asked to give proof of life and she wouldn't do it. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=209.6s)]
*  That's their cruelty. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=214.68s)]
*  That's their callousness. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=215.72s)]
*  And, you know, we know he was taken there, but I think the last time you were on, we [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=218.72s)]
*  played a clip of you saying, we don't even, we haven't heard from him since March. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=226.72s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=233.51999999999998s)]
*  I think what's really important for the American public to understand about this case is that [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=234.51999999999998s)]
*  we, the United States government, gave Andre an appointment to come to the United States [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=238.76000000000002s)]
*  and to seek asylum. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=244.96s)]
*  So imagine you're a young man, you're gay, you're in your country, you're trying to flee [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=247.0s)]
*  because you're being persecuted for who you are. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=252.04000000000002s)]
*  In Venezuela. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=254.56s)]
*  Right, in Venezuela. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=255.56s)]
*  You apply for an asylum process in the U.S. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=256.56s)]
*  We say, come to the U.S. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=259.28000000000003s)]
*  He comes to the border of the United States. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=261.52s)]
*  He is processed. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=263.92s)]
*  He passes his first exam, which essentially validates that he is under threat. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=265.08s)]
*  And then from there, he is taken to a detention center. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=270.8s)]
*  And from there, he then deported to a foreign prison, not in his home country, but in El [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=273.64s)]
*  Salvador. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=279.2s)]
*  Since he arrived in that country, there has been no proof of life. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=280.68s)]
*  This is someone that has been described by his parents as delicate, as sweet, as never [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=284.24s)]
*  causing any problems. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=290.36s)]
*  And Andre also deserves due process. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=292.48s)]
*  The Constitution of the United States says that all persons deserve due process. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=294.92s)]
*  And what I think is very important, this is Pride Month. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=300.16s)]
*  I know we're celebrating our community. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=302.92s)]
*  We're trying to celebrate our progress. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=304.68s)]
*  Share Andre's story this month. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=307.44s)]
*  Share his story because we need to ensure that he's one alive and that we actually bring [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=310.8s)]
*  him back so that he gets his day in court. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=315.92s)]
*  Laverne, I'm curious what you think about the Supreme Court case that revived the straight [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=319.32s)]
*  woman's reverse discrimination claim. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=324.03999999999996s)]
*  So this was Marlene Ames, who said she was treated unfairly at work because she is straight. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=326.28s)]
*  The unanimous ruling could make it easier, Lawrence Hurley writes, in some parts of the [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=332.8s)]
*  country for people belonging to majority groups to bring such reverse discrimination claims. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=337.4s)]
*  Our community, black trans women specifically, actually face real discrimination over and [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=343.52s)]
*  over and over again in this country. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=349.08s)]
*  And I'm curious what you think this case might do to queer black women. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=350.68s)]
*  First of all, the story is just devastating. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=356.28s)]
*  It's so hard for me to hear about this story. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=361.76s)]
*  I think the 200 people who have been sent to El Salvador with no due process, it's devastating. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=363.68s)]
*  And we know that this is a concentration camp. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=371.04s)]
*  It's like, it's so inhumane and so disgusting. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=374.0s)]
*  And that our tax dollars are funding that. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=379.28000000000003s)]
*  It's just, it breaks my heart. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=381.64000000000004s)]
*  The Ames case I find interesting. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=386.28000000000003s)]
*  I find also that it was a unanimous decision written by Justice Jackson, who I love. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=388.32000000000005s)]
*  I think what's interesting is that basically the basis is that there shouldn't be a higher [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=396.72s)]
*  burden for the majority person filing a discrimination suit. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=401.72s)]
*  And in theory, if that makes sense, and if all nine judges say that, but then that means [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=406.40000000000003s)]
*  she has to go back to the courts and prove her case. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=413.36s)]
*  I see no evidence, as I heard about this case and started reading, I was like, where's the [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=416.56s)]
*  evidence that she was discriminating against because she's straight? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=421.6s)]
*  Just because a gay person was hired or another gay person was hired doesn't mean you were [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=424.76s)]
*  discriminated against because you were straight. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=430.0s)]
*  There is no evidence of that. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=431.71999999999997s)]
*  The Supreme Court ruled that she doesn't have to be held to a higher standard, but it doesn't [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=434.03999999999996s)]
*  seem like there's any evidence. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=439.71999999999997s)]
*  And what the problem with this in a larger scale is that it just really supports in the [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=441.12s)]
*  context of anti-DEI, anti-you know, the reverse discrimination thing is that it'll be spun [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=445.28s)]
*  by Republicans that reverse discrimination is really a thing. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=453.56s)]
*  That's how it'll be spun. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=459.04s)]
*  Right. Your reaction to the Supreme Court case, and especially I think a lot of people were [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=460.36s)]
*  surprised that it was a unanimous decision. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=464.56s)]
*  Yeah, first of all, I agree. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=469.84000000000003s)]
*  And let me just say a thing about the courts, what's happening right now, what's really [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=471.76s)]
*  important for people to understand is I know that this country, we're feeling attacked. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=474.84000000000003s)]
*  Our community certainly is, but all communities are feeling attacked, whether you're [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=478.6s)]
*  it's women, whether it's immigrants, whether it's workers that are in labor unions. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=483.24s)]
*  And we have to think in this moment that the courts are actually in some cases, the last [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=487.36s)]
*  line of defense right now. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=492.6s)]
*  A lot of cases. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=494.02000000000004s)]
*  A lot of cases. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=495.02000000000004s)]
*  Members of Congress aren't really doing their job. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ca-LQnQmso&t=496.02000000000004s)]
