# Conditions for ICE detainees are ‘horrific’: Attorney shines light on lack of food & necessities
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4)
*  Tensions remain high in Los Angeles amid the demonstrations against President Trump's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=0.0s)]
*  massive immigration crackdown. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=5.64s)]
*  And we're hearing from people on the ground now about why they're taking a stand. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=8.24s)]
*  I'm not OK with this. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=14.72s)]
*  I'm not OK with people getting taken from their jobs and being taken from when they're [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=15.72s)]
*  going into the federal building for their appointments to do this the right way. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=19.76s)]
*  We don't feel safe. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  We're standing up for the children that can't stand up for themselves or their parents. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  We need immigrant workers in this city really badly. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=29.36s)]
*  We've just gone through devastating fires. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=33.4s)]
*  We've lost 14,000 structures. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=35.56s)]
*  And if you look at who builds this city, it's immigrants. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=38.32s)]
*  Joining us now, Lindsay Taslowski. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=43.76s)]
*  She's the president, CEO and co-founder of the Immigrant Defenders Law Center. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=45.72s)]
*  Lindsay, what are you hearing about the fear and confusion people are experiencing with [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=50.32s)]
*  this uptick we're seeing in ICE arrests and these workplace raids and other operations [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=56.96s)]
*  that are outside the typical? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=61.52s)]
*  Yeah, thanks for having me, Anna. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=64.04s)]
*  What we're seeing here in Los Angeles is really a city under siege. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  We starting on Friday have seen large scale enforcement actions that are ripping our communities [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=72.44s)]
*  apart. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=79.0s)]
*  These are happening to people who are at work. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=80.32000000000001s)]
*  As attorneys, we have been blocked from accessing people. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=83.0s)]
*  But because some of our attorneys spent 12 hours yesterday at an immigration detention [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=86.52s)]
*  center waiting to be able to speak to just five people of the hundreds who have been [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=91.84s)]
*  rounded up, we do have some information on who these raids are targeting. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=96.52s)]
*  And they are targeting long-term residents, people who are being picked up at work, off [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=101.67999999999999s)]
*  of the streets, of the seven people that we were finally able to speak with after two [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=106.6s)]
*  days of waiting. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=111.67999999999999s)]
*  They had been here, five of them, more than 20 years. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=113.24s)]
*  They have children in our local schools. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=116.48s)]
*  They are our neighbors. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=118.56s)]
*  They are part of our community. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=119.56s)]
*  So the anger that you hear in the voices of the people who you just profiled at the protests, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=121.04s)]
*  it is real. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  We are feeling this because this is targeting the very core of who we are as Angelenos. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  It's targeting our neighborhoods and our homes and our neighbors. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=132.56s)]
*  And people are upset because of exactly who this is targeting. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=136.56s)]
*  I mean, we're hearing that they have now detained hundreds in some of these recent raids. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=140.0s)]
*  Where are they being held exactly? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=146.35999999999999s)]
*  Because we also reported that detention centers are over capacity. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=148.35999999999999s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=153.76s)]
*  People are being held in places that normally don't hold people in government custody. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=154.76s)]
*  We received reports of a family, two parents, young parents with a three-year-old child [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=160.42s)]
*  who were held in an office building for over two days and only given lazed potato chips [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=166.16s)]
*  and milk and animal crackers for their young child. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=171.24s)]
*  People being held in the areas of detention centers that don't normally house people. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=175.04000000000002s)]
*  We heard from people yesterday that for days, one man who was diabetic wasn't given his [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=180.6s)]
*  medication. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=186.04000000000002s)]
*  We heard about another person who went days without their medication sleeping on the floors [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=187.12s)]
*  of rooms that are usually the day centers for those detention centers. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=192.36s)]
*  What we are hearing about the conditions that people are being held in, it's not surprising [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=197.76000000000002s)]
*  that they have not allowed Congress members in to conduct oversight because the conditions [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=202.4s)]
*  we are hearing about are horrific. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=206.92s)]
*  In addition to the fact that they are denying attorneys access to people, they are denying [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=209.46s)]
*  us the ability to go in and speak with people and let them know their rights. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=214.52s)]
*  In one instance, as our attorneys yelled to people their information as they were being [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=219.36s)]
*  loaded into a van, an ICE officer actually began honking the horn so that the people [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=224.68s)]
*  they were detaining couldn't hear the legal information from the attorneys that were [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=229.6s)]
*  trying to communicate with them. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=233.44s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=235.04s)]
*  Also eye-opening. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=236.04s)]
*  And as we talk about this immigration crackdown, you represent Andre Hernandez Romero. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=237.04s)]
*  He's that gay makeup artist deported to Seacop, that notorious El Salvadoran prison when President [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=241.44s)]
*  Trump had invoked the Alien Enemies Act. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=246.28s)]
*  Well, Judge Boasberg, who has this case, just ruled that the men there do have to have due [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=248.64s)]
*  process. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=255.07999999999998s)]
*  But an appeals court has now paused that order. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=256.68s)]
*  In the meantime, you have another judge who has ruled the president's use of the Alien [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=259.32s)]
*  Enemies Act was unlawful. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=262.96s)]
*  I believe this is the third judge who has ruled that. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=264.56s)]
*  So what does all that mean right now for these detainees that are still in El Salvador? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=266.96s)]
*  Well, today is day 88. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=272.2s)]
*  It's day 88 of Andre, our other clients who are at Seacot, and all of the men who were [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=275.79999999999995s)]
*  sent there, who we know their due process was violated. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=281.44s)]
*  It is day 88 of their lives being in danger. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=285.44s)]
*  This pause of Judge Boasberg's order that the government facilitate the due process [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=288.92s)]
*  rights for these men is absolutely frustrating. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=294.4s)]
*  The justice system was already moving way too slow when people's lives are in danger. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=298.44s)]
*  But this pause is incredibly frustrating for the legal team and for the families. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=303.56s)]
*  For Andre's mother, it's been 88 days since she's had any proof of life for her son, since [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=309.68s)]
*  she's been able to communicate with him. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=314.96s)]
*  We are pushing forward. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=317.92s)]
*  We will continue to fight in the courts because we know their due process rights were violated. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=319.72s)]
*  And the only way for them to rectify that, to vindicate those due process rights, is [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=325.12s)]
*  for them to be able to come back here and have their day in court. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=329.8s)]
*  Lindsay Toslowski, thanks for shining light. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=333.2s)]
*  We appreciate you joining us. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=335.36s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOs9lekloB4&t=337.32s)]
