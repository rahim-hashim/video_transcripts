# Planes, yachts, and trophy wives: Rep. Crockett slams ‘transfer of wealth’ from Trump agenda bill
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0)
*  Texas congressman Jasmine Crockett, she's a member of the Oversight and Judicial Committees. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome my friend. It's good to have you as always. Before I get to a couple things I'd [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=5.36s)]
*  plan to speak with you about, what are your thoughts about the, about Kristi Noem, you know, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=8.88s)]
*  Department of Homeland Security secretary, being over there? Do you think this is about [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=14.4s)]
*  trying to repair some sort of fracture, tensions, as Matt Bradley was very aptly calling them? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=19.28s)]
*  Is it about a quick discussion about what happened tragically this last week in Washington? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=25.439999999999998s)]
*  Is there an underpinning about Israel not being happy about Donald Trump wanting to [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=32.32s)]
*  negotiate with Iran? I mean, there's a lot of possibilities what discussions could be about. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=36.8s)]
*  Yeah, you went over all of the kind of sane things that this could be about, but I have [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=43.92s)]
*  found a lack of sanity from this administration. I have found them to be more decisive when it [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=49.28s)]
*  comes to making sure that they've got a good photo op. And so as far as I'm concerned, I doubt [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=56.72s)]
*  that there's anything of substance that she probably is over there to deal with. I doubt that [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=61.92s)]
*  she is going to decide to have a conversation about what happened to those two young people [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=67.04s)]
*  that worked for the Israeli embassy and talk about potential security measures that may need [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=73.28s)]
*  to be increased in cooperation. I doubt it is anything of substance. You just add a good photo [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=80.24s)]
*  op and I think that that's probably all Kristi Noem is good for is a photo op. All right, let's get [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=86.0s)]
*  to the tax breaks in President Trump's big, beautiful domestic spending bill. It's going to [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=91.44s)]
*  cost the government what about four, maybe more, five trillion? It's going to cut Medicaid, other [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=95.68s)]
*  safety net programs by at least 700 billion. Studies show those tax breaks are going to [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=100.96s)]
*  increase income for the top earning households. And I mean the top top while reducing income for [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=105.91999999999999s)]
*  the poorest 10%. So if it passes, how does it affect your constituents? And what do you say [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=111.11999999999999s)]
*  to Republicans who claim this bill is all about fiscal responsibility? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=116.39999999999999s)]
*  First of all, there's nothing but a transfer of wealth in a country in which under the Biden [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=122.8s)]
*  Harris administration, that wealth gap was actually starting to shrink because there were [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=127.36s)]
*  actual jobs that were being created. We saw through the Chips and Science Act that we ended up [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=132.32s)]
*  providing for opportunities for new high tech manufacturing jobs. We also saw through the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=138.4s)]
*  Inflation Reduction Act that there were so many opportunities around new green jobs. All we have [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=145.04s)]
*  seen out of this administration is that they have cut jobs, whether it was within the federal [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=151.52s)]
*  government or outside of the federal government. And what we've also seen is that they don't care [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=155.84s)]
*  about the people that are struggling the most, the people that believe in the American dream, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=161.76s)]
*  that believe that they should be able to come from anywhere and still have an opportunity at [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=166.16s)]
*  prosperity. So beyond that, beyond the fact that it's just really a cruel bill, it's this idea [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=171.36s)]
*  that they are going to somehow be fiscally responsible when we know under the first Trump [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=179.12s)]
*  administration, they ran the national deficit up $8 trillion. And with this one bill, they want to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=185.68s)]
*  raise the debt ceiling an additional $5 trillion. So here is the deal. If we have cut off everything [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=191.36s)]
*  that would help somebody, which doesn't sound like a very Christian thing to do, if we're going to do [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=198.48000000000002s)]
*  all of that, at least have something to show for it. They have nothing to show for it except for, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=203.36s)]
*  again, those top earners being able to say, have their next trophy wife or buy their next yacht or [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=207.52s)]
*  get their next plane. That doesn't work for me. And that obviously does not work for my constituents. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=215.04000000000002s)]
*  Let's talk about what President Trump did yesterday, giving the commencement address [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=222.0s)]
*  at West Point. Besides congratulating the graduating cadets, they got to hear the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=225.68s)]
*  president veer off into his usual grievances and political attacks. Let's take a listen. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=229.76000000000002s)]
*  I went through more investigations than Alphonse Capone. And now I'm talking to you as president. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=234.16s)]
*  Can you believe this? I must tell you, a lot of trophy wives. Does it work out? They subjected [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=242.24s)]
*  the armed forces to all manner of social projects and political causes while leaving our borders [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=247.51999999999998s)]
*  undefended and depleting our arsenals to fight other countries' wars. The job of the U.S. armed [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=254.0s)]
*  forces is not to host drag shows. We will not have men playing in women's sports, if that's okay. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=261.44s)]
*  So look, we are all used to Trump making campaign-style diaprotribes in, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=271.68s)]
*  you know, inappropriate settings. But what is your response to him doing it at West Point? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=276.08000000000004s)]
*  Listen, you say we're all used to it. No, I am tired of it, Alex. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=282.56s)]
*  Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I'm right there with you. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=286.8s)]
*  He literally sounds like someone who was broken out of the insane asylum. Like, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=288.56s)]
*  he'd just be all over the place. Like, give him some ADHD medicine, if nothing else, because I [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=294.48s)]
*  don't know where he's ever going to go. And I don't think that those that have gone through West Point [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=301.44s)]
*  expected to have their commander-in-chief address them and start talking about trophy wives or start [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=307.28s)]
*  talking about how he had so many investigations. What a great reminder that you are not qualified [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=314.0s)]
*  to be the person that potentially will command us as troops to go into war. Like, that is not [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=320.16s)]
*  instilling confidence whatsoever. And honestly, our troops deserve better. Our graduates deserve [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=327.20000000000005s)]
*  better. We as a country deserve better. And frankly, if we are going to ever be seen as [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=334.0s)]
*  the world leaders that we historically have been, the world deserves better. It is time for [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=339.36s)]
*  Republicans to start calling him out and start questioning his mental acuity and whether or not [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=344.24s)]
*  he is equipped to serve mentally. We know when it comes down to his criminality, he is not [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=350.08000000000004s)]
*  qualified to serve, but this is just absolutely deplorable. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=357.04s)]
*  So Trump this week, as you well know, returned to his trade war, threatening a 50% tax on all [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=361.12s)]
*  European Union imports and a 25% tariff on Apple iPhones if they aren't made in America. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=366.48s)]
*  I mean, this once again threw the markets into uncertainty. Stocks went plummeting. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=372.64000000000004s)]
*  Listen to what political analyst Cornell Belcher told me about this yesterday. Here it is. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=376.64000000000004s)]
*  Imagine for one moment that Barack Obama was interfering in the free market system the way [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=382.48s)]
*  Donald Trump is. Imagine how Wall Street would lose their stuff. They would lose their minds [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=388.48s)]
*  Barack Obama was having this sort of chaos and pain inflicted just on a whim. Wall Street [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=395.36s)]
*  elections coming up, you got to make them pay for this. If you pull the plug on the [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=404.4s)]
*  pocketbook, and a lot of this might stop. Do you agree with Cornell? I mean, is Wall Street [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=409.92s)]
*  just giving Trump a pass that it would never give to a Democratic president? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=416.4s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. There is no way. In fact, you're talking about Wall Street. I think [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=419.68s)]
*  even in this country, the people are giving him a pass. I mean, the people gave him a pass when they [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=427.52s)]
*  elected him with 34 convictions. I mean, he has got nothing but special privilege treatment. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=432.32s)]
*  And sadly enough, while he is enjoying this privilege, it is only causing harm and wreaking [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=438.4s)]
*  havoc on us as a country. I mean, the safest thing that you can ever have is a bond, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=444.24s)]
*  allegedly, at least in the United States, right? And we know even the bond markets are being shaken. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=449.84000000000003s)]
*  We know that our credit rating was recently reduced, which for everyone watching at home, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=455.28000000000003s)]
*  what that means is that when your credit score drops from above 800 and drops down, say, into [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=461.12s)]
*  the 600s, that means that your debt is going to cost you more money. I mean, all he is doing is [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=466.8s)]
*  costing us money and giving us less resources overall and then telling us, you know what, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=472.16s)]
*  go ahead and pay more for that iPhone, that iPhone that we know that you're using consistently. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=478.32000000000005s)]
*  Or he's telling our friends, like, why would you tell the EU that you want to invoke these [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=484.0s)]
*  tariffs? Tariffs should always be something that we are using on the people that we are not the [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=489.52000000000004s)]
*  friendliest with, not on our closest allies. And he started with our closest allies when he went [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=495.36s)]
*  after Mexico and when he went after Canada. I can't say that China is necessarily our closest [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=501.28s)]
*  ally, but when it comes to trade, we know that the world overall has been highly dependent upon [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=506.71999999999997s)]
*  China. That is why we were so stunted and why we ended up experiencing the inflation that we did [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=512.64s)]
*  when we went through the global pandemic. Right now, all the inflation that we are experiencing [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=518.4s)]
*  is self-inflicted or Trump-inflicted. I'm curious, if the Democrats take over [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=523.92s)]
*  after the midterms next year, the House and or Senate, do you think they're going to push [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=529.84s)]
*  for investigations into Trump's family and the whole crypto acquisitions that he is getting? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=534.32s)]
*  Well, Alex, I'm glad you asked. Listen, so long as we end up taking the House, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=543.52s)]
*  which I fully anticipate that we will do and we are going to work hard to obviously help our [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=551.6800000000001s)]
*  Senate colleagues as well, then as someone who serves on the Oversight Committee and hopes to [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=556.24s)]
*  lead the Oversight Committee, I can guarantee you that we will do what we are supposed to do [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=561.44s)]
*  as constitutionally sworn members of the House, which means that we will conduct oversight. That [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=566.72s)]
*  means that we will investigate. We will look at whether or not this president himself has violated [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=571.36s)]
*  the emoluments clause as relates to say such things as getting a $400 million plane from the [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=576.8s)]
*  Qataris. We also will make sure that we're looking into all these business deals that they have going [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=582.96s)]
*  on. I mean, think about it this way, Alex, they were going after Hunter because he sat on a board. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=587.76s)]
*  Think about how much money they are raking in, whether we're talking about the next golf [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=593.76s)]
*  resort that they're setting up in Qatar or whether we're talking about them leveling Gaza as they've [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=600.24s)]
*  talked about and talked about how it would be great beachfront property, whether we're talking [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=606.0s)]
*  about this crypto scam, the scam that people didn't even want to walk into and show their faces. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=611.04s)]
*  Let me tell you, there is no shortage of things for us to dig into and determine whether or not [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=616.3199999999999s)]
*  there have been not only violations of the law, but definitely violations of our constitution as a whole. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=622.3199999999999s)]
*  Did you make a little news here? Didn't you say you hope to lead that committee? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=628.4s)]
*  I absolutely do. Unfortunately, we are going to lay our dear colleague, Jerry Conley, to rest here on [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=633.28s)]
*  Tuesday. There will have to be an election to determine who is going to lead the oversight [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_am5wGsO0&t=641.6s)]
