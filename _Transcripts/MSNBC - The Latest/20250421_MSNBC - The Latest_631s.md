**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc)
*  We begin with NBC News International correspondent Claudio Lavanga in Vatican City, Thomas Reese, the senior analyst at [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=0.0s)]
*  Religion News Service who previously was with National Catholic Reporter, a former US ambassador to the Vatican during Pope Benedict's papacy [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=6.7s)]
*  Ambassador Francis Rooney and USA Today Washington bureau chief Susan Page. Claudio take us to [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=15.1s)]
*  the Vatican right now. What's it like? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=21.48s)]
*  Jose, you can see behind me. There's still a lot of people here in St. Peter's Square and around the Vatican now [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=24.68s)]
*  This is about six o'clock in the evening, but there's people that have been trickling in all day [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=31.08s)]
*  There were already a lot of people here even before the announcement of the Pope's death because this is Easter Monday [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=36.08s)]
*  It is a national holiday. It is also a jubilee year [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=41.959999999999994s)]
*  But then of course a lot of people also came here to pay the respects after the announcement of the Pope's death earlier [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=45.36s)]
*  This morning. Well now the Vatican has announced that in about an hour and a half from now in St. Peter [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=51.44s)]
*  they will recite a [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=56.64s)]
*  Rosary in memory of Pope Francis and he's invited the faithful to come along and join [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=58.76s)]
*  Them in the rosary also in about a couple of hours from now [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=65.28s)]
*  the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=69.47999999999999s)]
*  American Cardinal Cardinal Kevin Farrell who's acting as the camera lingo of the Catholic Church [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=70.96s)]
*  This is the name of a local admin is kind of a temporary administration [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=76.84s)]
*  Administrator of a Catholic Church in between popes. He will preside over the right of [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=80.52s)]
*  Confirmation of death and the deposition of the body of Pope Francis inside a coffin now [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=86.24s)]
*  That's also a special occasion because the Pope Francis has simplified that [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=92.0s)]
*  Streamlined that process in the past popes used to be placed into three different coffins [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  The Pope has simplified that it that really goes along with his humble way of [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=102.0s)]
*  Dealing with the Catholic Church and with tradition. He said no [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=107.16s)]
*  We only need one zinc lined simple wooden church is wooden coffin [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=110.44s)]
*  And he's going to be placed in there and then as early as Wednesday in a couple of days [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=114.11999999999999s)]
*  The Vatican spokesperson told us that he will be start aligning state inside st. Peter's Basilica [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=118.67999999999999s)]
*  Behind me to allow [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=125.72s)]
*  The pilgrims the faithful the Catholics anyone who wants to pay their last respects to Pope Francis to do so [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=127.76s)]
*  For about 24 to 48 hours and we do expect very very long [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=136.07999999999998s)]
*  Cues of pilgrims wanting to do that because Pope Francis was a very loved [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=140.56s)]
*  Pope here at the Vatican in Rome in Italy and I'm sure around the world as well also [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=145.68s)]
*  I know that this is just right now essentially occurring and maybe they haven't announced how [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=151.4s)]
*  This is going to be handled but among the things that this pope changed in structure and even in [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=157.52s)]
*  Tradition is that he is he spent his entire time as Pope in the Casa Santa Marta not in the Pope's [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=165.12s)]
*  Apartments there at at the Vatican [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=172.76s)]
*  And so traditionally the Pope's quarters are closed when the Pope dies [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=176.4s)]
*  But Santa Marta is where the Cardinals have to come and spend their time when they come to Rome [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=183.84s)]
*  For the conclave any information on what they're going to do on Santa Marta the second the entire second floor of Santa Marta has been [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=189.56s)]
*  the Pope's [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=197.68s)]
*  Residence in the Vatican [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=199.28000000000003s)]
*  Absolutely right Jose if he decided from day one not to live in the luxurious enormous [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=201.28s)]
*  Apartment that is dedicated to the Pope's in the Apostolic Palace and decided to live in that room in this kind of residence [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=207.08s)]
*  Let me just explain what Domus Casa Santa Marta is is basically a residence inside the Vatican [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=213.4s)]
*  And it's a very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=221.16s)]
*  Basically a residence inside the Vatican some B&B bed and breakfast that was built by the Pope John Paul II [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=228.12s)]
*  specifically to host [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=237.64000000000001s)]
*  Cardinals during conclave because it was always a problem where to host them during this event because there are so many [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=239.28s)]
*  Coming to Rome for that occasion so the Pope decided to just live in one of those rooms [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=245.20000000000002s)]
*  They're all kind of a smaller smallish rooms and as you mentioned it is not clear [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=249.20000000000002s)]
*  What's gonna happen are they gonna seal that room instead of the papal apartments where he's never lived not very clear and by sealing [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=255.24s)]
*  His room and the whole floor are they gonna take away? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=262.40000000000003s)]
*  One or several rooms away from the cardinals who are coming for the conclave that that is one of the things the things that the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=265.72s)]
*  Vatican had not really [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=271.36s)]
*  They've really specified or confirmed so we'll have to wait from them to understand what's going on there Jose I [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=272.88s)]
*  I [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=279.44s)]
*  Imagine it's with all of the things that are going on [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=280.44s)]
*  That's one of the issues that they're gonna have to announce shortly the Thomas [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=282.47999999999996s)]
*  How how did Francis? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=287.32s)]
*  Change or shape the Catholic Church, and he wasn't the most prolific writer [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=290.32s)]
*  He was certainly wrote some books, but he wasn't the most prolific of writers of writers popes [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=296.59999999999997s)]
*  How did he what was his major impact? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=303.08s)]
*  Pope Francis really changed the culture the of the Catholic Church [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=308.91999999999996s)]
*  you know we've in the past tend to shake our fingers at people and condemn things and [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=314.84s)]
*  Be kind of a nag [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=322.03999999999996s)]
*  Pope Francis wanted to embrace people wanted to welcome them [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=324.24s)]
*  He talked about the church as a field hospital for the wounded not a country club for the beautiful people [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=327.96s)]
*  So he was very pastoral he was also very prophetic he spoke out on issues of justice and peace and [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=335.8s)]
*  You know was just long for piecing in the Middle East and in Ukraine and parts of Africa that are warring [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=344.2s)]
*  And he also spoke out in defense of the environment. I mean, this is the Pope that embraced the environmental movement [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=352.32s)]
*  Accepted [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=360.71999999999997s)]
*  Global warming as a fact and said that we have to respond to it and do something about it [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=362.08s)]
*  So these are the kinds of things he did [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=367.88s)]
*  to change the nature of the Catholic Church and also to [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=372.24s)]
*  Really have an influence on the world in which we all live [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=376.88s)]
*  Yes, Susan that influence he at times focused on the United States and its politics in many ways [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=382.44s)]
*  You know you remember [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=390.8s)]
*  2015 when the Pope came to Washington the only Pope to address a joint session of Congress and with a different message than other [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=392.71999999999997s)]
*  modern popes had had [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=400.88s)]
*  He talked not only about the issue of abortion which had put him at odds with many Democrats [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=402.76s)]
*  He also talked about issues like climate change and immigration [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=408.2s)]
*  And a Middle East peace things that sometimes put him at odds with Republicans [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=412.12s)]
*  He was very much aligned with the foreign policy of President Obama and he spoke out against the immigration [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=417.52s)]
*  policies in particular of [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=424.88s)]
*  President Trump against building the wall and against his rhetoric with migrants [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=426.8s)]
*  This was very very different and it it I think energized some parts of the Catholic Church [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=431.24s)]
*  In the United States, but it also has divided American Catholics [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=437.4s)]
*  And we know from the polling that Pew does along on issues of religion that Catholic [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=441.15999999999997s)]
*  Democrats have a much almost universally revere Pope Francis, but Catholic Republicans are somewhat [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=446.84s)]
*  Divided on him. They still approve him by much lower numbers than Catholic Democrats [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=454.47999999999996s)]
*  And in that way the Pope just reflects I think modern American politics generally [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=459.28s)]
*  Yeah an ambassador of just thinking one of the things that the Pope did maybe because of where he was born and where he was raised [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=464.88s)]
*  ambassadors he opened the focus or the the prism [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=472.6s)]
*  towards [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=476.68s)]
*  Africa and and and the Americas [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=478.48s)]
*  It's his impact on those parts of the world was far more significant. I think than many recognize [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=481.4s)]
*  Well, he did a lot of things no one has done before I mean when he went he started out by [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=489.64s)]
*  new newly into his papacy going to Lampedusa and calling the [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=494.12s)]
*  Calling out the plight of migrants and the global he called it the globalization of indifference [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=499.0s)]
*  He had a great way with expressive imagery in the way he described problems around the world [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=503.4s)]
*  And he was the first Pope to go to Saudi Arabia or to the Arabian Peninsula into Iraq. He went a lot of places [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=508.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, and and and the the [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=515.2s)]
*  And I'm just wondering that traveling which he visited 65 countries in the 12 plus years that he was [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=518.08s)]
*  You know Pope [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=525.68s)]
*  And I will never forget his visit [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=527.56s)]
*  To Mexico and it wasn't just the fact that Mexico is such a powerful [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=530.84s)]
*  Catholic country, but it's where he chose to hold mass [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=536.64s)]
*  And with whom he chose to hold mass and a father. I'm just wondering [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=541.68s)]
*  There is so much symbolism in the decisions that he took [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=546.68s)]
*  Absolutely, I mean that was quite a visit when he came to Mexico and he came right up to the border and [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=551.8s)]
*  Celebrated the Eucharist there and talked about how we should be building bridges not walls [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=559.96s)]
*  That was not subtle at all on what he was trying to say [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=566.8000000000001s)]
*  This is a pope who really [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=572.6s)]
*  Spoke for the marginalized for the refugees for the migrants for the sick for the poor [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=576.72s)]
*  This is a pope who embraced those people and said that these are the ones that we have to care for [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=584.48s)]
*  Because his whole message was one of compassion how much God loves us and then how God is [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=591.12s)]
*  Calling us to respond by loving our neighbors loving one another [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=597.68s)]
*  especially the poor and the [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=602.8s)]
*  marginalized [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=605.52s)]
*  You [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhoWpFgomYc&t=620.64s)]
