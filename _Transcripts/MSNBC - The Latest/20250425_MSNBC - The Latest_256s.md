# Pope Francis brought young people from diverse backgrounds together through his non-profit
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyEBn1oZhqg)
*  Joining us now is Jimena Flores, Executive Director of Scolas USA, a global nonprofit [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyEBn1oZhqg&t=0.0s)]
*  founded by Pope Francis in 2013 that brings young people together at educational institutions from [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyEBn1oZhqg&t=6.16s)]
*  around the world. Jimena, it's always a treat to see you as well. Why was this cause, and if you [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyEBn1oZhqg&t=11.84s)]
*  would talk to us a little bit about what Scolas is. Yes, Jose, thank you so much for this opportunity. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyEBn1oZhqg&t=17.92s)]
*  Well, Scolas was an initiative that took Pope Francis back in 2001 when he was bishop of [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyEBn1oZhqg&t=25.04s)]
*  Buenos Aires. He wasn't yet a pope and was out of the conflict where Buenos Aires, if you remember, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyEBn1oZhqg&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  the civil war that Buenos Aires was facing back in the time when everyone was in conflict, there was [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyEBn1oZhqg&t=38.32s)]
*  no peace in the country. So he was taking and working with the educators and saying that we [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyEBn1oZhqg&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  need to gather together the young people from different backgrounds, not just Catholics, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyEBn1oZhqg&t=51.2s)]
*  but Jewish, Muslim, and non-believers, and let's try to start thinking and listening what are their [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyEBn1oZhqg&t=56.720000000000006s)]
*  voices and what they say. So Scolas Ocurientes, the foundation of that started by gathering people [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyEBn1oZhqg&t=63.92s)]
*  back at the time in Buenos Aires. These young people that gathered together in 2001, they could [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyEBn1oZhqg&t=70.80000000000001s)]
*  transport 37 laws. We are talking about children from 15 to 25 years old who transports 37 laws [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyEBn1oZhqg&t=76.32s)]
*  in the government promoting the peace, and it was the beginning of creating peace back in Buenos [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyEBn1oZhqg&t=84.96s)]
*  Aires. And that was the foundation of Scolas Ocurientes. And when he became the pope in 2013, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyEBn1oZhqg&t=90.0s)]
*  then he was saying to the global president of Scolas, who was his closest friend and educator, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyEBn1oZhqg&t=98.24s)]
*  let's take Scolas not just to, there is not just a problem in Buenos Aires or in Argentina, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyEBn1oZhqg&t=105.28s)]
*  there is a problem of youth that needs to speak and needs to be listened all over the world. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyEBn1oZhqg&t=110.8s)]
*  And then it was called Scolas because it's Escuelas, schools in Italian, Ocurientes, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyEBn1oZhqg&t=116.4s)]
*  that with meaning. So we can actually through Scolas listen to the youth and embrace them [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyEBn1oZhqg&t=122.72s)]
*  and leadership to transform the society, not leave everything to the authorities, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyEBn1oZhqg&t=128.96s)]
*  by empowering teenagers. And you know, I remember with Telemundo, who has had a strong and long [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyEBn1oZhqg&t=133.76s)]
*  working relationship with Scolas, I remember the opportunity that I had to be a part of a worldwide [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyEBn1oZhqg&t=140.07999999999998s)]
*  satellite link up between the pope in the Vatican and young people from Mexico all throughout the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyEBn1oZhqg&t=147.12s)]
*  United States. What do you think the pope's basic most important legacy is vis-a-vis the children? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyEBn1oZhqg&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  Yes, definitely will be for the youth because he created a way for them to express themselves, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyEBn1oZhqg&t=162.16s)]
*  to be listened. And the legacy is not now that we have created the spaces, the legacy continues [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyEBn1oZhqg&t=171.68s)]
*  because we work now with the educational institution, not just in the United States, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyEBn1oZhqg&t=178.07999999999998s)]
*  that we work already with public schools from Miami public schools, Los Angeles, New York, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyEBn1oZhqg&t=183.35999999999999s)]
*  Chicago, but also in 70 countries. So the main legacy is how we can embrace an educational with [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyEBn1oZhqg&t=188.8s)]
*  meaning through a methodology created by Pope Francis and the educators when we can do, we can [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyEBn1oZhqg&t=194.72s)]
*  experience the voices and teenagers can lead changes, can be active members of society, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyEBn1oZhqg&t=201.12s)]
*  but most importantly, they can collaborate together even though if they believe in different things. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyEBn1oZhqg&t=208.56s)]
*  So for just to give you an example, we are working with teenagers that are Jewish with [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyEBn1oZhqg&t=216.08s)]
*  muslim together and this is embracing a way to create peace from the teens, from the children, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyEBn1oZhqg&t=221.36s)]
*  and see the life in a different way. Jimena Flores, thank you very much for being with us today, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyEBn1oZhqg&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  very much appreciate it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyEBn1oZhqg&t=234.32000000000002s)]
