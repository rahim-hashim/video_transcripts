# 'Crunch time': Trump and Putin to speak in 'high-stakes' call over war in Ukraine
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0)
*  Let's go to NBC News White House correspondent Yamiche Alcindor, former CIA officer and MSNBC [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=0.0s)]
*  national security and intel analyst Arch Pauli Maropoulos, and former deputy assistant secretary [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=6.32s)]
*  of state Joel Rubin. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=11.44s)]
*  Yamiche, this first call was set to begin at 10 a.m., so any minute. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=12.84s)]
*  What kind of expectations does the White House have here? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=17.92s)]
*  Well, this is really a high stakes call, and expectations are very high, as President Trump [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=20.6s)]
*  said that nothing, quote, nothing can happen without him directly talking to the president [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=26.84s)]
*  of Russia. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=31.72s)]
*  So that is now happening separately. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=32.72s)]
*  He's going to then talk to the president of Ukraine and NATO leaders. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=34.64s)]
*  So we know that European leaders have said that they're going to be pushing for a 30-day [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=37.38s)]
*  unconditional ceasefire. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=41.019999999999996s)]
*  But President Trump has also said he wants to end this war altogether, what he's calling [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=43.08s)]
*  a bloodbath. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  We've also just heard from the vice president, J.D. Vance, earlier today in Rome take a listen [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  to what he had to say. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  I'd say we're more than open. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=52.76s)]
*  Then we're eventually just going to have to say, this is not our war. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=57.48s)]
*  It's Joe Biden's war. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=60.519999999999996s)]
*  It's Vladimir Putin's war. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=61.72s)]
*  It's not our war. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=62.96s)]
*  We're going to try to end it. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=63.96s)]
*  But if we can't end it, we're eventually going to say, you know what, that was worth a try, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=64.96s)]
*  but we're not doing it anymore. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=68.24s)]
*  Now it's really interesting because the vice president is in some ways echoing what we've [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=70.32s)]
*  also heard from Secretary of State Marco Rubio and President Trump, essentially saying that [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=73.52s)]
*  the United States could walk away if things just don't look like they're progressing, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=78.0s)]
*  that there's not enough enthusiasm to end this war. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=82.0s)]
*  That being said, President Trump has said that he was going to end this war on day one. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=84.47999999999999s)]
*  He since said that he was joking in some ways, but that he in fact is very much determined [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=88.52s)]
*  to end this war. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=93.08s)]
*  But it is, I think, an open question. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=94.56s)]
*  How long could negotiations go on without the White House just finally saying, you know [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=96.06s)]
*  what, we're going to walk away? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=100.39999999999999s)]
*  That's a big question that is continuing to loom over all of this, Anna. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=101.39999999999999s)]
*  Joel, hours before this Trump and Putin phone call, Russia launched its biggest drone attack [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=105.56s)]
*  on Ukraine since the start of this war. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=110.84s)]
*  Putin told state TV that Russia is going to win this war. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=113.72s)]
*  What does that tell you about Putin's approach to these talks? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=116.88000000000001s)]
*  Does he think he has leverage? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=119.92s)]
*  You know, Anna, it means that Putin thinks he's in the driver's seat. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=122.88000000000001s)]
*  This is a weak policy. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=126.28s)]
*  There's no demands on Vladimir Putin at all. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=128.56s)]
*  In fact, right now, the Trump administration is not spending $3 billion that it was appropriated [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=130.84s)]
*  to provide in military aid to Ukraine. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=137.16s)]
*  So what we're seeing is Vladimir Putin kind of leading this whole discussion. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=139.54s)]
*  That's what's so strange about today's theatrics, which is it's almost as if Donald Trump is [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=143.82s)]
*  chasing Vladimir Putin, begging him to give him a bone, give him some kind of win, something [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=148.62s)]
*  to show that he is not being totally humiliated for claiming that he'd end this war on day [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=155.89999999999998s)]
*  one. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=160.89999999999998s)]
*  But he hasn't. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=161.89999999999998s)]
*  And it's an imbalanced policy. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=162.89999999999998s)]
*  It needs to be rebalanced. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=164.22s)]
*  The Congress is standing up saying it will move on sanctions and President Trump should [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=165.82s)]
*  move on those sanctions. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=170.2s)]
*  He should have moved on them a weeks ago. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=171.82s)]
*  But certainly now, after these calls, I think he has no choice but to do so because Vladimir [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=173.92s)]
*  Putin is not taking his his argument seriously. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=179.68s)]
*  But do you think, Mark, that more sanctions would make Vladimir Putin take Donald Trump [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=183.7s)]
*  more seriously? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=188.82s)]
*  Well, I wish that Trump would surely listen to the intelligence community. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=189.82s)]
*  I'm sure there is many leadership profiles, as many assessments that state that the only [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=194.38s)]
*  thing that Putin will listen to is pressure. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=198.74s)]
*  Now, as pressure increased sanctions, I mean, the package put together by Lindsey Graham [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=201.78s)]
*  is pretty robust. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=206.22s)]
*  I also think that what should be on the table is increasing offensive military assistance [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=207.98s)]
*  to Ukraine. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=212.01999999999998s)]
*  Of course, this is something that Trump doesn't seem to want to do. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=213.01999999999998s)]
*  But basically, the world sees this as the United States not being able to put pressure [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=216.1s)]
*  on Putin. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=220.78s)]
*  I mean, Trump knows this. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=222.18s)]
*  And so this really is crunch time. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=223.82s)]
*  I think this phone call is going to set up probably a summit. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=225.3s)]
*  But at some point, you know, President Trump either changes the narrative that he's not [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=228.5s)]
*  sided with Moscow or or he kind of goes along with the charade from the Russians. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=232.06s)]
*  But, you know, Putin understands one thing. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=236.98s)]
*  That's pressure. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=238.94s)]
*  The U.S. hasn't put that on him yet. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=239.94s)]
*  So, Yamiche, as Mark brings up, there's the question about whether there'll be this face [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=242.26s)]
*  to face meeting with President Putin and President Trump. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=247.1s)]
*  And that's what we're hearing from the White House. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=250.74s)]
*  This phone call is going to set the table for right. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=252.57999999999998s)]
*  Where do those efforts stand to actually get Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in the same [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=255.02s)]
*  room? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=259.78s)]
*  Well, that's a key question, because, again, it goes back to this idea that President Trump [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=260.78s)]
*  has continued to say he has a friendly relationship with President Putin, that he feels like he [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=264.3s)]
*  can do this deal and get this done. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=268.38s)]
*  That being said, getting them in a room is complicated. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=271.18s)]
*  And Secretary of State Marco Rubio talked about that over the weekend. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=273.74s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=277.02s)]
*  We don't want to be involved in this process of just endless talks. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=278.06s)]
*  There has to be some progress, some movement forward. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=282.85999999999996s)]
*  Ultimately, one of the things that could help break this long jam, perhaps the only thing [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=285.26s)]
*  that can, is a direct conversation between President Trump and Vladimir Putin. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=289.53999999999996s)]
*  The mechanics of setting that kind of meeting up would require a little bit of work. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=295.53999999999996s)]
*  So, I can't say that's being planned as we speak in terms of picking a site and a date. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=299.06s)]
*  But the president wants to do it. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=303.53999999999996s)]
*  He wants to do it as soon as feasible. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=304.7s)]
*  Now, here are two things that are really important. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=307.82s)]
*  The first is that there was supposed to be this delegation meeting, this summit in Turkey. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=310.1s)]
*  And President Putin had suggested it. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=315.7s)]
*  President Zelensky of Ukraine showed up. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=317.98s)]
*  And then President Putin said, actually, I'm not going. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=320.02000000000004s)]
*  And then the two delegations were literally in separate cities, miles and miles apart, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=321.90000000000003s)]
*  one in Istanbul, one in Ankara. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=325.74s)]
*  Eventually, they ended up getting together. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=327.3s)]
*  The other thing is that the president has said that he wants to meet with President [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=329.18s)]
*  Putin at some point, but we just don't know if the logistics are going to be there. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=332.42s)]
*  He has gotten more critical of President Putin, which is, I think, a really interesting space to watch. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=335.86s)]
*  We know he saw that disastrous meeting in the Oval Office with the president of Ukraine. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=340.42s)]
*  So what it actually looks like and how combustible a meeting could be is also a big question, Your Honor. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=344.21999999999997s)]
*  Joel, what are your thoughts on getting Trump and Putin in the same room? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=349.42s)]
*  How would you be advising the president to handle that scenario? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=352.62s)]
*  What red flags or red lines would you be concerned about? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=355.98s)]
*  Well, you know, and I think that's Donald Trump's goal all along. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=359.58s)]
*  He wants to reset American relations with Russia. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=362.90000000000003s)]
*  He wants to ally with Vladimir Putin. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=365.90000000000003s)]
*  This war with Ukraine is an irritant. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=368.26s)]
*  It's a sort of a stumbling block to get in that alliance going. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=369.94s)]
*  And quite frankly, I don't know why we would bet on a dying horse. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=373.06s)]
*  Look, look, we just had elections in Romania yesterday where the population voted for a centrist candidate, not the Kremlin candidate. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=376.66s)]
*  The European Union is now getting closer to Britain after Brexit. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=383.98s)]
*  Democratic allies of the United States do not want to be alive with Vladimir Putin. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=388.94s)]
*  So doing a phone call and then a meeting with Vladimir Putin for not stopping this war really does [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=392.78s)]
*  signify that Donald Trump doesn't want the war as the primary concern. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=399.21999999999997s)]
*  What he wants is the U.S. allied with Russia. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=402.98s)]
*  That's your concern, all of us. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=405.54s)]
*  Although about a month ago, Mark, we saw Trump actually change his tune on Putin, posting famously, Vladimir Stop. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=407.14s)]
*  That was after Russian strikes on Kiev. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=415.94s)]
*  And Putin was, you know, obviously ignoring this as far as what we've seen since then. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=418.58s)]
*  Do you think he respects President Trump? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=424.18s)]
*  No, I think Putin thinks President Trump is a very easy mark. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=427.9s)]
*  I mean, you know, one of the interesting things is that, you know, we see some difference in rhetoric. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=431.82s)]
*  You know, the U.S. has been a bit more critical, whether it's a Trump true social post or comments by Marco Rubio or J.D. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=436.18s)]
*  Vance, they've been a little bit more critical of Putin, but that has not translated into action. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=445.14s)]
*  And I think at this point, that is what we need to see if there's going to be any kind of change in U.S. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=449.78s)]
*  policy. You know, the European allies of Ukraine are watching this incredibly closely. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=453.98s)]
*  And, you know, my recommendations to my European friends in governments there is to is to certainly plan for the notion that the U.S. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=459.65999999999997s)]
*  is going to walk away because even if, for example, Trump does something that we see as somewhat tougher on Russia, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=467.62s)]
*  you know, everything is so dysfunctional, he can change his mind three, four or five days later. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=475.46s)]
*  And I think Joel and Yamiche have said it perfectly, that ultimately Trump wants better trade relations with Russia. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=479.86s)]
*  He wants rapprochement with Putin. That is his ultimate goal. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=485.62s)]
*  So if you're in Zelensky, if you're in Ukraine, if you're the European partners, you have to plan almost for a day after where the U.S. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=489.02s)]
*  does depart the scene. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=495.86s)]
*  Yeah, on that, Joel, we heard the vice president essentially say there could come a day where the U.S. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=497.62s)]
*  just walks, just pulls out of this altogether. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=503.46000000000004s)]
*  What's the risk if that happens? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=507.02000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, you know, those are not empty words when the vice president United States says that that has real meaning and impact. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=508.90000000000003s)]
*  And to do that for the United States to walk away from a Democratic ally that is on the receiving end of an assault, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=514.46s)]
*  an invasion by an autocratic regime should send shivers up the spine of all of our allies around the world, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=521.46s)]
*  Taiwan included, who's looking at China, of course, our European allies. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=528.1s)]
*  Now they're unifying, trying to find ways to backfill support to Ukraine. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=532.1s)]
*  In the case of the United States pulling out, this is a major shift in ideas, ideology and national security strategy for the United States. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=536.14s)]
*  You know, I believe that we still have deep commitments here in the country towards our Democratic allies nationally. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=544.38s)]
*  And in the Congress. But the president, his team, they don't seem to view that as the primary commitment for our foreign policy. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=551.3s)]
*  And I think that's what you hear when JD Vance says we can walk away. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=558.26s)]
*  Yamiche Alcindor, Mark Polymeropoulos and Joel Rubin, thank you all so much. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oav6f1VrH0&t=562.06s)]
