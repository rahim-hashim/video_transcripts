# Noem pushing to keep FEMA alive after saying White House would ‘eliminate’ it
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y)
*  Joining me now is Deanne Criswell, former FEMA administrator. It's really important to have [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=0.0s)]
*  someone with your expertise on right now. Do you see if Kristi Noem is behind the scenes and she's [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=4.96s)]
*  saying we have to support the need here. Is that a sign to you that without a plan for how to [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=10.32s)]
*  reorient or eliminate FEMA, she at least and a few others that were just named realized it's hard [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  to see how the U.S. can do without FEMA? Yeah, Kristi Noem was a governor of South Dakota. I [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=24.72s)]
*  had an opportunity to meet with her after some significant flooding that South Dakota experienced [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=31.84s)]
*  last year. And I think she knows the role and the needs that communities have and how FEMA comes in [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=36.72s)]
*  to support those communities. I don't think anybody disagrees that there are ways to improve the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=43.36s)]
*  efficiency and get rid of some of the bureaucracy in the way that FEMA delivers programs. But it is [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=48.72s)]
*  a necessary function to be able to assist these communities when they experience these really [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=54.88s)]
*  catastrophic events. And it has to be done thoughtfully and over time and in partnership [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=59.68s)]
*  with the states, right? So they can understand what's going to be expected of them and they can [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=64.88s)]
*  plan appropriately ahead of time. If you were to make massive changes right before hurricane season, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=69.28s)]
*  nobody would be prepared and they would be at greater risk of having significant impacts to [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=74.72s)]
*  their communities. There are local papers in Florida, for example, that are reporting right [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=79.84s)]
*  now that they rely on FEMA, that localities are relying on FEMA to remove storm debris, to cover [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=83.76s)]
*  overtime for first responders. You know, maybe at some point, as you say, there's a longer term [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=91.12s)]
*  plan where states or someone else picks up that expense. But right now, given the budgets in place, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=96.96s)]
*  walk us through what FEMA does on the ground in the immediate aftermath and not just of the storm, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=105.52s)]
*  but then after all of the news media goes away and people are left with things like rebuilding [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=111.67999999999999s)]
*  and debris. Well, it's a really good question because I think that there's always a lot of [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=117.75999999999999s)]
*  confusion as to what FEMA's role really is. You know, FEMA doesn't replace those first responders. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=122.72s)]
*  Every disaster starts and ends at that local jurisdiction, the firefighters, EMS, police [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=128.88s)]
*  officers, the National Guard, they are going in there to do that immediate response to help those [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=133.84s)]
*  communities as the storm passes and when it's safe for them to do so. When it exceeds their capability, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=138.88s)]
*  that's when the state can ask FEMA to send in additional assistance. And in the response phase, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=145.2s)]
*  we can send in search and rescue teams, we can pre-stage commodities like food and water so it [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=150.32s)]
*  can be readily available if needed. And we only employ those resources when the state asks for [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=155.6s)]
*  them. And so that's the role in the beginning. And I think one of the biggest pieces of that, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=161.12s)]
*  too, is there's a team that's embedded with that state director. So they're working side by side [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=165.12s)]
*  and as that state director identifies a need, FEMA can act quickly to make sure a resource is moving [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=170.95999999999998s)]
*  and can get to that community as quickly as possible. But as you said, when the cameras go away [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  and all of the media goes away and they're continuing their recovery, what FEMA is is a [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  reimbursement. The states always have the responsibility. They are always in charge [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=186.0s)]
*  of their recovery. FEMA's role is to reimburse them for some of the costs that they incur if [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=191.12s)]
*  they're eligible under the different programs. And we want to work with them and provide them [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=196.56s)]
*  sometimes technical assistance if they don't have the capacity to do it on their own. And so [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=200.72s)]
*  just not the reimbursement, but that technical assistance is also so important. Just like you [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=206.4s)]
*  said with debris removal, many states have really good contracts, but some don't. And so that way [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  we have an ability to tap into the Army Corps of Engineers to come in and assist them if they don't [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=216.56s)]
*  have the necessary means to be able to bring in their own contractors to remove that degree. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=222.0s)]
*  It's really about a partnership and making sure we're working together to achieve the governor's [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=226.72s)]
*  goals. As we are just a couple of days away from the start of what is expected to be a bigger [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  average hurricane season, your expertise is invaluable helping people understand the role [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=236.48s)]
*  of FEMA. So thanks for coming on the show. Thanks, Chris. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-xEuM3U4Y&t=240.72s)]
