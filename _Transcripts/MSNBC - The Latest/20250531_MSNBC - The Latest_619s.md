# Oregon AG touts confidence in courts as Trump tries to ‘amass power in unconstitutional ways’
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I)
*  And Trump is borrowing from his playbook here at home. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=0.0s)]
*  We've got the details. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=3.84s)]
*  Plus, his administration is making new threats [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=5.36s)]
*  against Harvard and other universities, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=8.08s)]
*  even while facing pushback from the courts. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=10.64s)]
*  And another of Trump's personal attorneys [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=14.08s)]
*  just landed a cushy appointment. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=16.88s)]
*  But we begin this hour with President Donald Trump's [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=19.72s)]
*  continued reality check from the co-equal judicial branch [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=22.26s)]
*  as the courts exercise their crucial role [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=26.52s)]
*  in the system of checks and balances [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=28.68s)]
*  and give a reminder to Trump that he is, in fact, not a king. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=31.28s)]
*  Just this week, both the US Court of International Trade [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=36.6s)]
*  and a separate federal judge in Washington [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=39.72s)]
*  blocked the administration from imposing many of Trump's [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=42.76s)]
*  sweeping tariffs, ruling Trump overstepped his authority. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=46.56s)]
*  An appellate court has temporarily [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=51.08s)]
*  stayed one of the rulings, as it considers [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=52.92s)]
*  the government's appeal. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=55.2s)]
*  Additionally, a federal judge on Tuesday [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=56.6s)]
*  struck down Trump's executive order [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=59.400000000000006s)]
*  that targeted the law firm Wilmer Hale, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=61.24s)]
*  calling it unconstitutional. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=64.12s)]
*  This marks the third ruling to overwhelmingly reject [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=66.36s)]
*  Trump's effort to punish law firms he perceives [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=69.60000000000001s)]
*  as enemies of his administration. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=72.52000000000001s)]
*  And in Trump's escalating war against Harvard University, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=75.64s)]
*  a federal judge extended her order, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=78.92s)]
*  blocking the administration from revoking the school's ability [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=81.32000000000001s)]
*  to enroll foreign students. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=84.88s)]
*  But of course, it's not all defeats for Trump. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=88.08s)]
*  The Supreme Court ruled yesterday [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=91.56s)]
*  in Trump's favor on immigration, allowing the administration [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=93.24s)]
*  to revoke the temporary legal status granted by the Biden [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=96.64s)]
*  administration to more than half a million immigrants [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=100.24s)]
*  from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  Joining us now, Mary McCord, former acting assistant [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=107.88s)]
*  attorney general for national security at the Justice [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=111.0s)]
*  Department, and Oregon attorney general Dan Rayfield, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=113.56s)]
*  who led one of the lawsuits blocking Trump's tariffs. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=117.36s)]
*  Thank you both very much for coming to the weekend. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=120.84s)]
*  Mary, let me start with you. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=125.16s)]
*  And I want to play what the White House Deputy Chief [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=127.16s)]
*  of Staff, Stephen Miller, tweeted on Wednesday [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=131.16s)]
*  about the federal court, federal trade [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=135.56s)]
*  courts blocking of Trump's tariffs. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=137.88s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=140.0s)]
*  The judicial coup is out of control. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=141.04000000000002s)]
*  And he's been repeating this in television interviews. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=144.04000000000002s)]
*  Please explain to the viewers what [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=147.12s)]
*  the Deputy Chief of Staff to the President of the United States, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=150.36s)]
*  why that is just patently wrong. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=153.64000000000001s)]
*  And what's behind it? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=157.0s)]
*  Why is he saying it? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=158.20000000000002s)]
*  Well, so the judicial branch is a third co-equal branch [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=159.08s)]
*  of government. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=162.4s)]
*  We have three branches of government, right? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=163.12s)]
*  The executive, the legislative, and the judicial. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=165.20000000000002s)]
*  And in fact, this president and this Stephen Miller [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=168.08s)]
*  kind of don't want to admit that, right? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=171.84s)]
*  The executive branch, the actions [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=173.96s)]
*  we've been seeing since January 20th, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=175.88000000000002s)]
*  have really been intended to kind of steamroll [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=178.20000000000002s)]
*  both Congress's authority and judges' authority. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=180.92000000000002s)]
*  And they don't like those rulings, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=183.64000000000001s)]
*  and so they're making comments like that. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=185.10000000000002s)]
*  That's not a judicial coup. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=186.72000000000003s)]
*  I mean, the Supreme Court, since Marbury v. Madison, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=188.12s)]
*  the very founding of the country, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=191.36s)]
*  has said it's the judiciary's job to say what the law is. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=192.76000000000002s)]
*  And that Court of International Trade, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=196.84s)]
*  that's exactly what the court did. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=198.72s)]
*  That is a three-member panel, too. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=200.36s)]
*  That's not like this, you know, there's [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=202.84s)]
*  a lot of criticism out of the administration [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=204.24s)]
*  about a single federal district or a judge did something. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=206.16s)]
*  That was a three-judge panel that overwhelmingly said, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=209.08s)]
*  these tariffs are beyond the authority [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=212.72s)]
*  that Congress delegated under AIIPA for you to impose. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=215.12s)]
*  AIIPA is the International Economic Emergency Powers Act. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=219.12s)]
*  And Congress is the one under the Constitution [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=223.08s)]
*  that has the power to levy tariffs. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=226.28s)]
*  They delegated some power to the president, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=228.6s)]
*  but he exceeded that. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=231.68s)]
*  That is saying what the law is. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=232.88s)]
*  That's the judiciary's job. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=235.32s)]
*  Attorney General Rayfield, you know, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=236.92000000000002s)]
*  you are part of one of these tariff cases in Oregon. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=238.84s)]
*  And it feels like this is both for folks in your state [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=242.76s)]
*  about the impact on the people, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=246.36s)]
*  how the tariffs would impact the people in your state, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=247.96s)]
*  but also about reining in, if Congress won't do it, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=250.08s)]
*  as Mary's talking about, reining in [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=253.12s)]
*  the power of the president. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=254.92s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the motivation for bringing this [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=257.36s)]
*  starts with people. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=259.4s)]
*  Tariffs, again, always seems like something [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=260.96s)]
*  that isn't going to impact us in our daily lives, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=262.96s)]
*  but economists show that these tariffs, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=265.2s)]
*  as Donald Trump has tried to implement them, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=267.28s)]
*  was gonna be a $3,800 increase [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=269.52s)]
*  to average households each year. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=272.44s)]
*  And that's effectively a tax on all Americans. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=274.47999999999996s)]
*  So that's where we start out. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=276.47999999999996s)]
*  It's impacting businesses. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=277.84s)]
*  Here in Oregon, we have one of the largest [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=279.2s)]
*  nursery industries, this side of the Mississippi, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=281.28s)]
*  and they're pulling our products off the shelves in Canada. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=283.4s)]
*  It's hurting people, it's hurting businesses. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=286.4s)]
*  As a state, we're losing revenue. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=288.52s)]
*  And also, at the same time, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=292.03999999999996s)]
*  where goods and things that we purchase [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=294.12s)]
*  are becoming more expensive. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=296.08s)]
*  What that means for us in the community, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=297.32s)]
*  that means less money for schools, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=299.2s)]
*  less money for healthcare. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=300.64s)]
*  And then at the same time, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=301.91999999999996s)]
*  and I think this was just talked about, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=303.88s)]
*  this is bigger than us. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=305.23999999999995s)]
*  This is about the hallmark of our democracy, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=307.32s)]
*  about the separation of powers, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=310.0s)]
*  and how important it is that no one branch of government [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=311.68s)]
*  has too much power. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=315.12s)]
*  And this president is just trying to amass power [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=316.2s)]
*  in unconstitutional ways. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=319.96s)]
*  And that's why we're winning in courts right now. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=321.4s)]
*  So Mary, where does it go from here in the courts? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=325.52s)]
*  Because they'll appeal it, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=327.96s)]
*  and it's just gonna keep going up the chain? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=329.2s)]
*  Or can you explain to us what to expect? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=331.44s)]
*  And frankly, give, I mean, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=333.88s)]
*  it has such a ripple effect on the economy, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=337.0s)]
*  these arbitrary laws that he is enacting. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=339.64s)]
*  So in this particular case involving the tariffs, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=342.59999999999997s)]
*  already there's been, of course, an appeal, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=345.68s)]
*  not only appeal to the circuit court for the federal circuit, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=347.44s)]
*  that's where these appeals court, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=351.68s)]
*  these are Article III courts, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=353.56s)]
*  but they're sort of specialized courts. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=354.59999999999997s)]
*  That court has already issued a stay [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=356.32s)]
*  of the lower court's ruling, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=358.96s)]
*  which is that sort of whiplash effect, right? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=360.59999999999997s)]
*  The tariffs are off, the tariffs are back on. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=363.28s)]
*  But that stay is just an administrative stay. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=365.76s)]
*  It's just until they can actually have more time [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=368.12s)]
*  to take to rule on the motion, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=370.76s)]
*  and then ultimately rule on the substantive legal issues, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=372.08s)]
*  the same legal issues I was just talking about [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=375.48s)]
*  with respect to whether the president's executive orders [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=378.28000000000003s)]
*  and his tariffs have exceeded his authority, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=381.08s)]
*  both his constitutional authority and his statutory authority. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=383.2s)]
*  And then from there, you know, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=385.84000000000003s)]
*  if it's not a favorable ruling for Trump, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=388.2s)]
*  we can imagine that this will be in the Supreme Court. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=390.68s)]
*  And you know, what Trump's been doing [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=393.44s)]
*  in so many other cases is going to the Supreme Court [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=395.56s)]
*  even earlier if he gets a ruling he doesn't like, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=398.96s)]
*  and especially when a circuit court [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=402.4s)]
*  does not stay that ruling, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=404.68s)]
*  then he's been going straight up to the Supreme Court. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=406.52s)]
*  Their emergency docket is overflowing. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=408.79999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=411.32s)]
*  So then Attorney General Rayfield, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=412.32s)]
*  how concerned are you that, given what Mary just said, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=414.59999999999997s)]
*  the emergency docket of the Supreme Court is, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=419.4s)]
*  you know, overflowing with cases? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=421.84s)]
*  Are you, how confident are you [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=423.64s)]
*  that the Supreme Court of the United States [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=426.71999999999997s)]
*  will uphold the rule of law, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=429.44s)]
*  will be a block on the president when it's really needed, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=431.96s)]
*  especially since the president thinks [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=437.28s)]
*  that the Supreme Court works for him [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=439.36s)]
*  because he's appointed what, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=441.2s)]
*  three of the justices on the bench? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=442.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, here's the thing. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=446.15999999999997s)]
*  This case was as strong as it was on day one. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=447.0s)]
*  It's gonna be strong when we get to the Supreme Court, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=449.2s)]
*  if we get to the Supreme Court. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=451.47999999999996s)]
*  I think it's very interesting. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=454.32s)]
*  That three panel judge that has been referenced, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=455.16s)]
*  one of those was appointed by Donald Trump. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=457.28000000000003s)]
*  Another person was appointed by Ronald Reagan. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=460.12s)]
*  And so you have this unique dynamic [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=463.0s)]
*  where they're choosing the referees for the game, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=464.84000000000003s)]
*  but then they're complaining about the game [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=467.24s)]
*  on the back end of this thing. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=468.88s)]
*  And so I do feel confident. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=470.64000000000004s)]
*  I think we're in a moment in time [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=472.68s)]
*  where it comes to foundational, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=474.04s)]
*  hallmark constitutional issues, right? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=475.52000000000004s)]
*  Not giving the president more power [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=477.76s)]
*  than Congress has delegated. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=480.28000000000003s)]
*  They are standing up to him on these big issues. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=482.28000000000003s)]
*  And so I do feel confident [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=485.28000000000003s)]
*  as we move through the court systems. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=486.56s)]
*  Mr. Agee, I wanna follow up really quickly [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=489.32s)]
*  because I've asked Mary this question before. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=491.92s)]
*  The judges feel very fed up already, right? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=494.24s)]
*  As we're reading these opinions, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=498.24s)]
*  as we hear from these judges and justices, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=500.32s)]
*  they're getting kind of fed up with kind of the stretches [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=503.0s)]
*  that Donald Trump and his team are doing. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=505.2s)]
*  But if the Trump folks ignore them, then what? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=507.0s)]
*  Because our colleague Lisa Rubin writes, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=510.4s)]
*  but those victories conceal a goring cancer [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=513.4399999999999s)]
*  on the rule of law. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=515.48s)]
*  The seeming ease with which government lawyers [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=516.3199999999999s)]
*  and or officials under legal and ethical obligations [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=518.4s)]
*  to adhere to and execute our court orders [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=521.28s)]
*  are instead flouting them. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=523.68s)]
*  What happens if they just continue to ignore [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=525.6s)]
*  some of these court orders? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=528.9599999999999s)]
*  Including maybe the one that comes in your case. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=533.0s)]
*  You're absolutely right, they're getting fed up. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=534.6s)]
*  This is a big deal. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=535.88s)]
*  Last week in court, Trump's lawyers came in [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=537.0s)]
*  and effectively said, you know what, judges? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=540.92s)]
*  You can't review anything we do. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=542.4399999999999s)]
*  And the judges did not have that. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=545.04s)]
*  It was incredibly clear and palpable in that courtroom [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=546.48s)]
*  that they were not having this were above the law mentality [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=549.68s)]
*  in the courtroom. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=554.16s)]
*  And so I think you're starting to see these worries [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=555.0799999999999s)]
*  trickle into, like here in my community, right? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=557.8399999999999s)]
*  This is a big issue. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=560.8s)]
*  What happens if they stop following the court orders? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=561.64s)]
*  So far, specifically in this case, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=564.52s)]
*  we're not getting any indication [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=567.5999999999999s)]
*  that they are not going to follow these laws. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=569.3599999999999s)]
*  Uniquely, what they could do is try and pass tariffs [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=571.7199999999999s)]
*  under a different statute, right? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=575.0799999999999s)]
*  There's an actual Title 19 statutes [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=577.4s)]
*  that allow the president to set tariffs [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=579.88s)]
*  with specific safeguards for our economy, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=582.0799999999999s)]
*  safeguards for our businesses, safeguards for our consumers. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=585.04s)]
*  And so that's something that they could try and do, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=589.4399999999999s)]
*  but I do anticipate, especially in this case, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=592.3599999999999s)]
*  that they would follow the rule of law [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=594.64s)]
*  if we got a positive ruling in the Supreme Court. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVU_F33nj_I&t=596.04s)]
