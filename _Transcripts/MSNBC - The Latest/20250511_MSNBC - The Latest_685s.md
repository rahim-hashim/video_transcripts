# Pulitzer prize-winning Palestinian poet on the war in Gaza: 'Why is our suffering not acknowledged?'
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0)
*  As we have all been witnessing the horrific images and videos [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=0.0s)]
*  that are coming out of Gaza, something happened right here [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=3.4s)]
*  in the United States that should be acknowledged. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=5.8s)]
*  Mosab Abu Toha, a Palestinian poet and writer from Gaza, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=8.68s)]
*  has won the most prestigious award in American journalism, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=12.32s)]
*  the Pulitzer Prize in Commentary. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=15.48s)]
*  He was honored for essays in the New Yorker written [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=18.16s)]
*  after escaping Gaza with his family. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=20.46s)]
*  The Pulitzer board said his essays portrayed the quote [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=23.0s)]
*  physical and emotional carnage in Gaza that combined [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=26.2s)]
*  deep reporting with the intimacy of memoir [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=29.66s)]
*  to convey the Palestinian experience of more than a year [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=32.72s)]
*  and a half of war with Israel. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=36.0s)]
*  In one of his essays, he wrote, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=37.86s)]
*  in part, as I eat simple meals of chicken, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=39.46s)]
*  rice salad and olives with my family, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=42.58s)]
*  I think of the hunger in my homeland of all of the people [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=45.04s)]
*  with whom I want to share my meals. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=48.68s)]
*  I yearn to return to Gaza, sit at the kitchen table [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=50.44s)]
*  with my mother and father and make tea for my sisters. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=53.58s)]
*  I do not need to eat. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=57.14s)]
*  I only want to look at them again. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=58.72s)]
*  Joining us now is Mosab Abu Toha himself. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=61.66s)]
*  I wanna begin by asking you how you are. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=66.7s)]
*  There's so much to celebrate in this win, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=70.32s)]
*  but at the same time, you have family that is still in Gaza [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=73.7s)]
*  facing so much on a day-to-day basis. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=77.56s)]
*  How are you feeling right now? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=80.36s)]
*  I mean, I feel so heartbroken, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=82.53999999999999s)]
*  but at the same time, I feel so much honor [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=86.19999999999999s)]
*  having won this award. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=88.8s)]
*  My friends and family in Gaza are very proud, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=90.66s)]
*  and not only because of me, but also because of the work [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=93.74s)]
*  that I have worked to document. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=96.19999999999999s)]
*  How I feel, I mean, I don't know. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=99.64s)]
*  Every day we are losing someone. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  Every day we are learning about a new tragedy [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=105.44s)]
*  that is unfolding, not only for my family, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=107.82s)]
*  but also for our friends and students in Gaza. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=111.22s)]
*  Three days ago, my wife lost a first cousin of hers. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=113.96s)]
*  That first cousin was killed with her mother-in-law, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=118.44s)]
*  a brother-in-law, sister-in-law, and three children. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=122.3s)]
*  This is happening every day, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=126.17999999999999s)]
*  and I sometimes wake in the middle of the night. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=128.68s)]
*  I have nightmares, and I wake up feeling like [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=132.28s)]
*  something happened in Gaza, and I check the news, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=135.28s)]
*  and everything to some extent is fine. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=137.42s)]
*  I go back to sleep. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=139.72s)]
*  This is what I'm experiencing for at least 18 months. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=141.04000000000002s)]
*  That's so much to carry on a day-to-day basis. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=144.44s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, also especially winning the Pulitzer Prize, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=147.02s)]
*  which is a great honor for me as a writer. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  It comes with a great responsibility [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=152.92000000000002s)]
*  to carry more and more voices, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=155.36s)]
*  and I hope this Pulitzer Prize is an invitation [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=157.08s)]
*  for more writers and also more readers [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=160.10000000000002s)]
*  to read works that are coming from Gaza. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=162.02s)]
*  Congratulations, first of all, on your win. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=166.36s)]
*  I'm very sorry for everything you and your family [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=169.16s)]
*  continue to go through. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=171.20000000000002s)]
*  Your win is not without controversy, obviously, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=173.26s)]
*  and in particular, some comments you've made in the past [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=176.76s)]
*  about the Israeli hostages have been very controversial, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=179.48000000000002s)]
*  where you have said that most of the hostages [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=182.84s)]
*  held by Hamas are not actually hostages. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  I believe you specifically singled out Emily Demary, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=189.68s)]
*  who's a 28-year-old who was kidnapped from her home [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=192.24s)]
*  and held for 471 days and lost two fingers. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=196.02s)]
*  I'm just wondering, is there anything you wanna clarify [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=200.34s)]
*  about those comments? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=202.66000000000003s)]
*  First of all, I did not question her status as a hostage [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=204.62s)]
*  because she's a hostage, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=210.58s)]
*  but because what other Palestinians who were kidnapped, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=213.14000000000001s)]
*  I mean, I don't want to name people, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=216.18s)]
*  but I have people in my family who were kidnapped [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=218.28s)]
*  from checkpoints, from schools, from shelters, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=221.24s)]
*  and they are named prisoners. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=224.5s)]
*  So my question was, why should Emily and other hostages, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=226.70000000000002s)]
*  be named hostages while my loved ones [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=229.9s)]
*  should be named prisoners? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=232.06s)]
*  So that was the question. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=234.26000000000002s)]
*  I've never denied anyone suffering. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=235.26000000000002s)]
*  I know that everyone is suffering, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=237.26000000000002s)]
*  Israelis and Palestinians, but why are our sufferings [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=238.62s)]
*  not acknowledged? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=242.70000000000002s)]
*  Why are we called terrorists? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=243.62s)]
*  Why are we called prisoners of war [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=245.26000000000002s)]
*  while the Israelis who were kidnapped from Israel [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=247.02s)]
*  are named hostage? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=249.66000000000003s)]
*  Does this give them more humanity [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=251.06s)]
*  because they are Israelis while my loved ones [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=252.36s)]
*  are being named prisoners and they are tortured? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=255.46s)]
*  I mean, I myself, by the way, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=259.34000000000003s)]
*  I was kept hostage for 53 hours. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=261.38s)]
*  I was blindfolded and handcuffed and was beaten in my face [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=264.26s)]
*  and asked for them, for the Israeli soldiers, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=267.74s)]
*  to see a doctor and they denied me any medical treatment. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=269.62s)]
*  So no one is talking about this, why? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=272.78000000000003s)]
*  They are not acknowledging my suffering. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=275.34000000000003s)]
*  So I questioned, why are they given this privilege [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=277.26s)]
*  of being called a hostage while I am called [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=279.66s)]
*  in all the social, in all news platforms, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=282.38s)]
*  I was named, I was detained, I was a prisoner, why? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=285.21999999999997s)]
*  Am I less human than anyone else? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=288.85999999999996s)]
*  So that was the question. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=290.65999999999997s)]
*  It was not the question that she was not kidnapped, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=291.88s)]
*  that she was not tortured. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=294.21999999999997s)]
*  I did not talk about any of this. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=295.58s)]
*  Well, you did criticize some Western outlets [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=297.67999999999995s)]
*  for humanizing the hostages. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=300.34s)]
*  Because we are not humanized. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=302.7s)]
*  Well, I guess my question to you is, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=303.94s)]
*  wouldn't the better approach to be to humanize everyone, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=306.34s)]
*  to treat all humans as human? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=309.65999999999997s)]
*  Do you know what I'm going through every day? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=311.14s)]
*  I cannot even imagine. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=313.82s)]
*  Do you know how many members of my family were killed? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=314.65999999999997s)]
*  I cannot even imagine. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=316.46s)]
*  31 members of my family were killed in one airstrike. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=317.3s)]
*  And four of them were forced, first cousins were killed, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=320.7s)]
*  two of them with their husband and their children. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=323.9s)]
*  And you are requesting me how to use language here? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=325.86s)]
*  Oh, you brought it up. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=328.34s)]
*  I'm just asking you to elaborate on comments you had made [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=329.58s)]
*  that have attracted a lot of criticism. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=333.14s)]
*  That's all I'm asking. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=334.97999999999996s)]
*  Well, I mean, you know what, there is the point [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=335.82s)]
*  and I would like everyone to understand it. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=336.78s)]
*  A Palestinian won a Pulitzer Prize. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=339.82s)]
*  What do you expect the other side to say? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=341.5s)]
*  Are they going to celebrate it? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=344.3s)]
*  And by the way, the win is not my win as Musab. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=345.98s)]
*  It is for the stories that I shared with the whole world. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=348.26s)]
*  And I promise you, there are so many stories [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=351.3s)]
*  that I have that I haven't written. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=354.14000000000004s)]
*  One story, because they mentioned that Emily was kidnapped [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=356.18s)]
*  for 500 days, and I'm not denying this. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=359.86s)]
*  But I would like to tell you that a cousin of mine [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=363.70000000000005s)]
*  was killed in October, 2023, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=367.78000000000003s)]
*  and her body remained under the rubble for 558 days. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=370.94s)]
*  And still her husband and their child [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=376.06s)]
*  is still under the rubble until today. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=378.42s)]
*  So I don't want to compare several, I hate this. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=380.58000000000004s)]
*  But I mean, 560 days under the rubble, she was killed. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=383.86s)]
*  She was not kidnapped. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=387.86s)]
*  She did not lose two fingers. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=388.90000000000003s)]
*  I lost members of my family. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=390.58000000000004s)]
*  And this is not to minimize her suffering. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=392.70000000000005s)]
*  I've never attacked her as a human being. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=395.5s)]
*  But I was questioning, why should we humanize this soldier? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=398.02s)]
*  And she was a soldier. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=400.7s)]
*  And the other host he was a soldier too. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=402.26s)]
*  So I'm not making stories up. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=404.9s)]
*  I was questioning why should we sympathize with this soldier [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=406.65999999999997s)]
*  who a few days later after her release, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=410.34s)]
*  went to celebrate who? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=413.26s)]
*  Her sister who graduated from the Air Force. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=414.78s)]
*  What is the Israeli Air Force? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=416.9s)]
*  They are responsible for the killing of my family. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=418.29999999999995s)]
*  So why am I supposed to sympathize with her? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=420.82s)]
*  Not because she is A and B, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=423.41999999999996s)]
*  but no, because she is celebrating the graduation [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=426.38s)]
*  from the Air Force of a sister who, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=428.98s)]
*  and by the way, one last point. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=431.21999999999997s)]
*  In 2009, I was injured in an airstrike. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=433.54s)]
*  One piece of shrapnel pierced my neck, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=436.94s)]
*  three centimeters away from my windpipe. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=440.9s)]
*  And I was in that airstrike, seven people were killed. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=443.65999999999997s)]
*  So the question, who was going to kill me [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=446.14s)]
*  as a 16 year old child? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=449.06s)]
*  Let me, Mossad, let me ask you a question [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=451.34s)]
*  about the award itself. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=453.9s)]
*  You're talking about the Pulitzer Prize [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=455.38s)]
*  and how important it is. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=456.78s)]
*  What do you think the award symbolizes at a time [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=457.98s)]
*  when there is so much pressure on Palestinian voices [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=461.18s)]
*  here in the United States? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=463.86s)]
*  We're seeing students and people who are writing [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=464.82s)]
*  and activists being detained, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=466.94s)]
*  possibly potentially being deported. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=469.26s)]
*  What do you think it symbolizes that you, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=471.02s)]
*  a Palestinian poet who has gone through this experience, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=473.18s)]
*  has now received this prestigious award? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=475.9s)]
*  It symbolizes the Pulitzer Prize Award, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=478.82s)]
*  and I hope this is the case of all the journalists [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=484.42s)]
*  and journalist institutions. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=487.21999999999997s)]
*  They are acknowledging the importance of the Palestinian voice. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=489.65999999999997s)]
*  And I believe, I hope that this win [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=492.82s)]
*  would be a step towards a greater understanding [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=496.26s)]
*  of the Palestinian plight. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=499.18s)]
*  That is not only 18 months old, that is 77 years old. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=500.7s)]
*  I am the son of refugees. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=505.06s)]
*  My grandfather, Hassan, died in the refugee camp in 1984, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=508.14s)]
*  and he was buried. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=513.22s)]
*  I never met him because I was not born. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=514.06s)]
*  And you know, Ayman, I don't know where his grave is right now [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=516.66s)]
*  because Israel bombed the cemetery where he was buried. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=519.58s)]
*  So why am I deprived not only of Yaffa, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=525.18s)]
*  where my grandparents were expelled, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=527.6999999999999s)]
*  not only of seeing my grandparents, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=529.78s)]
*  but also I can't go to the cemetery and read Al-Fatiha, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=531.22s)]
*  the opening chapter of the Holy Quran, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=535.42s)]
*  on his grave, just like I don't, I can't, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=537.58s)]
*  there is no place that I can return to. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=539.98s)]
*  And this is what we left behind in Gaza. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=542.06s)]
*  We did not only leave a city, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=544.9799999999999s)]
*  we left every single memory that we created, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=547.9s)]
*  which I wish I could show to my children [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=550.9s)]
*  and my grandchildren. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=553.38s)]
*  If I go back to Gaza, what will I show my children? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=554.4599999999999s)]
*  There is no kindergarten to show them. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=557.9399999999999s)]
*  The university where I studied, I can't show them. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=560.5799999999999s)]
*  Even the grave of my brother, Hudaifa, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=562.9s)]
*  who passed away in 2006 in Bethlehem, his grave is gone. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=564.78s)]
*  I can't go to take my children to read, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=568.74s)]
*  to just say prayers on his grave. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=572.26s)]
*  I lost everything, so and they come to talk, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=574.66s)]
*  oh, he's not, he's denying his status as a hostage. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=576.82s)]
*  Is this really the big question? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=580.22s)]
*  Why don't you read the stories that I wrote [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=582.14s)]
*  and acknowledge and admit that you are, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=585.02s)]
*  the Israelis are committing a decades long genocide [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=587.9s)]
*  against the Palestinian people? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=592.02s)]
*  I wrote a piece about the starvation in Gaza. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=593.9s)]
*  Why don't they go read how my family [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=597.02s)]
*  is struggling to find food? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=598.86s)]
*  Every day, this is, I mean, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=601.54s)]
*  the same stories that I wrote for which I won. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=603.34s)]
*  I wrote four stories in 2024. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=605.78s)]
*  I won the Pulitzer Prize for those who said. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=607.5799999999999s)]
*  One of them was about the starvation. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=610.46s)]
*  I wrote it in February 2024, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=612.1s)]
*  and the starvation continues until today. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=614.34s)]
*  And then the other piece was about [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=618.1s)]
*  what we leave behind in Gaza, the refugee camp. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=619.74s)]
*  One question that no one is asking, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=623.38s)]
*  Israel destroyed so many refugee camps in Gaza. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=624.9s)]
*  One of them is the Jabali refugee camp [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=628.18s)]
*  where my mother was born. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=629.86s)]
*  It was nearly erased. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=631.66s)]
*  The question is not about the destruction of the refugee camp. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=633.74s)]
*  The question is, why is there still a refugee camp? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=636.98s)]
*  This is the question. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=640.78s)]
*  Go read the pieces and question these things. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=641.62s)]
*  We know many of our viewers are going to read your pieces [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=644.8199999999999s)]
*  if they haven't already. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=647.78s)]
*  They're incredibly engaged on these issues. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=649.3s)]
*  Moshe, we thank you for joining us this evening. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=651.54s)]
*  We congratulate you on this incredible honor, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=653.94s)]
*  and we wish your family health and safety. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=658.0200000000001s)]
*  Thank you for being here tonight. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=660.86s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=661.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=662.7800000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu2-ZgBxng0&t=683.94s)]
