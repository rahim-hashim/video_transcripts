# Trump 'needs to start penalizing Russia for its bad behavior': Fmr. Ukraine Ambassador
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8)
*  Joining us now is NBC News senior White House correspondent, Gabe Gutierrez. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=0.0s)]
*  Jeff Bennett, co-anchor of PBS NewsHour. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=4.36s)]
*  He's also an MSNBC political contributor and former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Stephen [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=6.88s)]
*  Pfeiffer. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=12.4s)]
*  He's the director of the Arms Control and Non-Proliferation Initiative at Brookings. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=13.4s)]
*  Thank you all for being here. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=18.76s)]
*  Gabe, what do we know about this call and what the White House is looking to achieve? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=20.0s)]
*  Oh, hi there, Honor. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=23.44s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=24.44s)]
*  The president has changed his tone, has increasingly changed his tone over the last several days [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=25.84s)]
*  when it comes to Vladimir Putin. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=31.8s)]
*  But White House officials say the president has been increasingly frustrated with both [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=33.52s)]
*  sides of this conflict. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=38.260000000000005s)]
*  Still, Secretary of State Marco Rubio over the weekend wondering if it might be possible [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=40.68s)]
*  that Vladimir Putin is tapping us along and the president essentially saying as much in [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=45.040000000000006s)]
*  a social media post several days ago. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=49.08s)]
*  But now we understand, according to a White House official, that Putin and Trump are both [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=51.44s)]
*  speaking. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=55.96s)]
*  And this is incredibly high stakes. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=56.96s)]
*  Vice President J.D. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=59.12s)]
*  Vance on his way back from Italy was asked about this phone call a little early on this [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=60.12s)]
*  morning. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=65.0s)]
*  Listen to what he said. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=66.0s)]
*  I'd say we're more than open to walking away. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=67.0s)]
*  I think one open question is, is Vladimir Putin serious about negotiating peace? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=71.8s)]
*  Takes two to tango. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=77.47999999999999s)]
*  I know the president's willing to do that. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=78.47999999999999s)]
*  But if Russia is not willing to do that, then we're eventually just going to say this is [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  not our war. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=83.2s)]
*  It's Joe Biden's war. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=84.32000000000001s)]
*  It's Vladimir Putin's war. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=85.52000000000001s)]
*  It's not our war. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=86.76s)]
*  We're going to try to end it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=88.0s)]
*  But if we can't end it, we're eventually going to say, you know what, that was worth a try, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=89.0s)]
*  but we're not doing anymore. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=92.04s)]
*  So a couple of things that we're looking at during this phone call or after this phone [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=93.04s)]
*  call, by the way, we do expect the readout from the White House and also press secretary [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=96.84s)]
*  Caroline Levitt saying that the president will also speak with Ukrainian President Zelensky [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=100.80000000000001s)]
*  as well as other NATO members. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=105.84s)]
*  But then the president might have to make a tactical decision here. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=108.22s)]
*  Does he still want to meet face to face with Vladimir Putin? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=111.25999999999999s)]
*  Just last week, he said that that was something that needed to happen in order for these peace [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=114.6s)]
*  talks to move forward. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=118.94s)]
*  This phone call should be critical to see what comes of that. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=120.38s)]
*  Ambassador NBC News, learning that just a few minutes ago, this phone call is underway [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=124.69999999999999s)]
*  officially. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=129.57999999999998s)]
*  What are you watching for? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=130.57999999999998s)]
*  Well, I have to say my expectations for the call are pretty modest. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=131.57999999999998s)]
*  I think what we've seen over the last three months is Vladimir Putin has really tried [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=136.7s)]
*  to string President Trump along. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=140.29999999999998s)]
*  And thus far, although President Trump has several times expressed frustration that the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=143.22s)]
*  Russians are not doing more, he hasn't yet done anything to express that frustration. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=148.73999999999998s)]
*  So even though the United States has significant leverage, it could apply to pressure Russia [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=154.6s)]
*  in terms of providing more military assistance to Ukraine and proceeding to tighten sanctioned [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=159.57999999999998s)]
*  loopholes to increase the sanctioned impacts on Russia in terms of moving with the Europeans [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=165.9s)]
*  to seize Russian central bank assets. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=171.38s)]
*  There's a lot of things that the United States could do and the president could do that would [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=173.98000000000002s)]
*  confront Putin with the prospect that if he continues the war and doesn't negotiate in [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=177.86s)]
*  a serious way, the economic, military and political costs for Russia are going to increase. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=183.1s)]
*  But unfortunately, the president has not applied any of that leverage. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=188.9s)]
*  And to your point, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine recently, Brigitte Brink, just [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=193.2s)]
*  resigned last month after three years in her post. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=203.2s)]
*  She's now speaking out about why she made that decision. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=206.52s)]
*  Listen. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=210.12s)]
*  I resigned from Ukraine and also from the Foreign Service because the policy since the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=211.12s)]
*  beginning of the administration was to put pressure on the victim Ukraine rather than [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=216.84s)]
*  on the aggressor Russia. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=221.4s)]
*  I fully agree that the war needs to end, but I believe that peace at any price is not peace [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=223.88s)]
*  at all. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=230.0s)]
*  It's appeasement. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=231.0s)]
*  And as we know from history, appeasement only leads to more war. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=232.12s)]
*  Jeff, if Putin is the last one in President Trump's ear, how do you see that shaping what [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=235.72s)]
*  comes next? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=242.32s)]
*  Well, it's a great question, Anna, because the asymmetry here is stark. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=243.32s)]
*  We have Donald Trump who is pushing for a quick end to this war. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=248.22s)]
*  And you have Vladimir Putin, who has shown that he is ready for a protracted conflict [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=252.62s)]
*  as this war enters its fourth year. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=257.46s)]
*  He has basically said, according out of the Kremlin, is that he is completely unmoved [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=260.42s)]
*  by the threat of further sanctions in large part because Russia's economy has already [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=264.94s)]
*  adjusted to years of severe sanctions. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=268.96s)]
*  He also appears that he is really not really willing to take any off ramp that is given [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=273.65999999999997s)]
*  to him. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=280.06s)]
*  And so the question becomes, the fear among European capitals around the world is that [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=281.06s)]
*  Kiev will be pressured into giving up more ground and that if the U.S. does decide that [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=285.21999999999997s)]
*  Vladimir Putin is not operating in good faith, that to take JD Vance at his word, the U.S. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=291.26s)]
*  would just walk away and say, this isn't our war. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=296.7s)]
*  Well, who would that benefit? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=299.06s)]
*  It certainly wouldn't benefit the West. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=300.26s)]
*  It would benefit Vladimir Putin, who by all outward appearances, views this war as existential [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=301.82s)]
*  and does not view it in his political benefit or in the benefit for Moscow to wind things [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=307.34s)]
*  down as evidenced by that drone strike, that massive drone strike just yesterday. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=312.09999999999997s)]
*  We know, of course, Putin's phone call with President Trump is a huge focus that we're [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=317.78s)]
*  all trying to get readouts on today. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=322.06s)]
*  But there's also the phone call with Zelensky that's expected. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=324.53999999999996s)]
*  And yesterday we know Zelensky had a good meeting, at least that's how he is reporting [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=326.98s)]
*  it out with Vice President JD Vance as well as Secretary of State Marco Rubio. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=330.97999999999996s)]
*  This was after Pope Leo's inauguration mass. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=334.97999999999996s)]
*  And you can see the picture here with the vice president and Zelensky smiling and laughing [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=337.34s)]
*  together. This is a photo provided by the White House. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=343.09999999999997s)]
*  Pretty striking. After that Oval Office blow up just a few months ago. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=346.14s)]
*  What more, Gabe, are we learning about that meeting and how those leaders came together? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=350.26s)]
*  It really is remarkable to see that picture side by side with that eruption here in the [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=354.78s)]
*  Oval Office, you're right, several months ago. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=360.14s)]
*  But there does seem to be just a slightly different posture with the Trump administration [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=363.14s)]
*  when it comes to dealing with Ukraine. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=368.38s)]
*  We heard the White House officials, including press secretary Carolyn Levitt today, call [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=371.5s)]
*  that meeting between Vice President Vance and Zelensky a productive meeting. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=376.18s)]
*  We heard as much from Ukrainian President Zelensky as well, who said that they touched [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=381.78s)]
*  upon the need for sanctions against Russia and also spoke about bilateral trade and defense [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=386.82s)]
*  cooperation and upcoming prisoner exchanges. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=391.9s)]
*  But Zelensky really used this opportunity, he says, to impress upon the United States [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=395.21999999999997s)]
*  the urgency of this and to try and get the Trump administration to ramp up the pressure [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=401.41999999999996s)]
*  on Vladimir Putin. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=407.26s)]
*  Question will be whether President Trump is swayed by whatever Putin has to say to him [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=409.41999999999996s)]
*  today during this phone call. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=413.9s)]
*  We'll be watching on that. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=416.17999999999995s)]
*  Ambassador, President Trump has been calling for a 30-day ceasefire to help pave the way [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=417.41999999999996s)]
*  for peace talks. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=421.5s)]
*  Yet Russia just unleashed its largest series of drone attacks since the war began over [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=422.5s)]
*  the weekend, launching hundreds of strikes. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=426.97999999999996s)]
*  Other cities were also shelled, including residential areas, according to Ukraine. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=430.29999999999995s)]
*  Was that meant to be a not-so-subtle message from President Putin? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=435.41999999999996s)]
*  Is Russia anywhere close to agreeing to peace? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=439.41999999999996s)]
*  No, I think at this point we have seen a Russian approach that is prepared to continue the [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=443.14s)]
*  war. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=449.58s)]
*  And it's helped, I think, in part by inconsistency in the White House. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=451.46s)]
*  So go back a week ago Saturday. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=455.91999999999996s)]
*  President Zelensky met with the leaders of France, Britain, Germany, and Poland, and [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=458.82s)]
*  they agreed that there should be a demand to Russia for a ceasefire with negotiations [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=464.82s)]
*  then to follow, but that if Russia did not quickly agree to a ceasefire, that there would [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=470.38s)]
*  be harsher Western sanctions. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=475.1s)]
*  And they had a phone call then a week ago Saturday with President Trump. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=478.06s)]
*  He agreed to that. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=480.98s)]
*  That was the position. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=482.58s)]
*  On Sunday, Putin says no to a ceasefire. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=484.14s)]
*  I'll do direct negotiations. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=486.74s)]
*  And President Trump flips to that. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=488.94s)]
*  So I think there's a concern. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=491.74s)]
*  Is the White House going to be consistent here? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=493.46s)]
*  But what I think Putin is trying to do, he does not want a ceasefire. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=495.86s)]
*  He has rejected the administration's proposal back in March for a ceasefire. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=499.34s)]
*  What he wants to do instead is to have direct negotiations. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=505.61999999999995s)]
*  But that's going to be a mechanism that allows the Russians to simply bog the talks down [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=509.08s)]
*  in details for months and months and months while they continue military operations. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=514.06s)]
*  And this is why I think it's important that if the president really wants to try to bring [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=519.3399999999999s)]
*  an end to this war, he needs to start penalizing Russia for its bad behavior and make it clear [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=523.06s)]
*  that the costs to Russia are going to escalate if Russia does not get serious about a ceasefire [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=529.0600000000001s)]
*  in a negotiation. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=534.1800000000001s)]
*  Look, Jeff, President Trump said on the campaign trail that he was going to end this war in [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=535.1800000000001s)]
*  his first 24 hours in office. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=539.94s)]
*  He's repeatedly called for an end to the violence that's unfolding there in Ukraine. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=542.3000000000001s)]
*  What kind of political pressure is he under to make a deal to end this conflict? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=546.5s)]
*  I would say it's significant political pressure in large part because he sort of set the terms [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=552.86s)]
*  for it. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=557.9s)]
*  And I think that President Trump has basically made the case that only he can be the one [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=559.8199999999999s)]
*  to influence Vladimir Putin. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=563.6999999999999s)]
*  He's not the first American president to believe that through the sheer force of personality [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=564.6999999999999s)]
*  or charisma or magnetism that that might somehow yield a desired outcome. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=569.42s)]
*  But Vladimir Putin has shown for years now that he is not willing to give up this protracted [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=573.86s)]
*  war. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=579.9s)]
*  And even during the Biden administration, the view was that Ukraine would not win this [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=580.9s)]
*  would be a negotiated end and that the goal was to give Ukraine the resources, the military [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=585.9s)]
*  intelligence, the military resources it needed to have the most leverage and to have the [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=591.6999999999999s)]
*  best seat at the table. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=596.3s)]
*  And to the ambassador's point, you could argue that the Trump administration, by vacillating, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=598.34s)]
*  has undermined Ukraine's position and by JD Vance even saying today ahead of the talks [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=602.98s)]
*  that the U.S. is prepared to walk away. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=608.6999999999999s)]
*  Well, that certainly strikes fear in the heart, I would imagine, of not just President Zelensky [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=610.9s)]
*  but European countries all around the world that will say Ukraine was the first, but Ukraine [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=615.82s)]
*  might not be the last if Russia has its way and is basically able to march across parts [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=621.1s)]
*  of Europe. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=627.38s)]
*  Such a good point about the other potential consequences if Russia is allowed to continue [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=628.38s)]
*  advancing. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=634.54s)]
*  Thank you so much, Gabe Gutierrez, Jeff Bennett and former ambassador Stephen Pfeiffer. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hJLf9J3b8&t=635.54s)]
