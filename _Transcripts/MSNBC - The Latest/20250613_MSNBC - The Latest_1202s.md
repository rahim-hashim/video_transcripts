# Crisis? Trump’s attack on law rebuked by Tyler Perry as he talks movies, vision & news with Melber
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s)
*  There are some interested and talented people who come by here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=0.0s)]
*  We appreciate all of them. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=3.12s)]
*  But this is one of those days where we are extra excited. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=4.16s)]
*  For an artist of so many talents, I bet you know many types of work he has created in [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  this world. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=12.92s)]
*  Tyler Perry, the director, actor, producer, playwright. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=13.92s)]
*  He is also an entrepreneur, a billionaire, media mogul. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=17.2s)]
*  Oprah says he is a true visionary and trailblazer. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=21.44s)]
*  He's known for so many things. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=25.16s)]
*  If you go back far enough, you have the Madea character, a box office hit to the tune of [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=26.32s)]
*  a global billion. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=30.48s)]
*  He's produced over 20 different TV series. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=31.48s)]
*  So if you say we work hard on this single show, he's done 20 of them, many of them across [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  the years and directed 30 films and counting. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=39.64s)]
*  His new Netflix project is the film Straw, starring Taraji P. Henson. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=43.2s)]
*  You don't know how hard it is to take care of my baby. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=49.36s)]
*  Or for what I make. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=54.56s)]
*  I can't get half of what she needs. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=58.4s)]
*  Nobody cares. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=60.8s)]
*  Nobody sees us. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=62.8s)]
*  This is my life. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=66.8s)]
*  Over and over. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=68.8s)]
*  Tyler Perry joins us. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=70.8s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=72.8s)]
*  It's my pleasure, my friend. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=73.8s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=74.8s)]
*  Really great to have you. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=75.8s)]
*  Watch you all the time. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=76.8s)]
*  Watch the beat all the time. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=77.8s)]
*  This project will jump right into it and then I'd love to talk more about your journey. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=79.24s)]
*  Or the beat. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=82.64s)]
*  Or the beat. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=83.64s)]
*  If you want to get into it, we go back and forth. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=84.64s)]
*  This is, like much of your work, something that looks at what pain and adversity can [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=87.24s)]
*  lead to. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=91.62s)]
*  Tell us about the story, what inspired it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=92.62s)]
*  I wanted to write this movie for everybody who is not seeing. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=94.0s)]
*  There's a line in the movie where she says, nobody sees us, nobody pays attention to us. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=97.8s)]
*  And I wanted to write this movie for everyone who's just caring a lot and doesn't feel like [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=101.92s)]
*  anybody in the country or anybody in the world cares. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=105.4s)]
*  The thing about this lead character that Taraji plays, she's a single mother raising her child [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=107.72s)]
*  and she finds herself with these compounding circumstances. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=112.04s)]
*  And I think the theme of the movie, one of the characters says, people don't know how [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=115.4s)]
*  expensive it is to be poor. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=119.24000000000001s)]
*  So what I wanted to do was just shine a light on what people are going through every day. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=121.06s)]
*  And that's what this movie is about. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=124.44s)]
*  In our political debates, a lot of things boil down to what you just said. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=126.4s)]
*  Do we see people as people? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=131.36s)]
*  And people can be more generous, fair. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=133.52s)]
*  When they see the humanity in others and vice versa. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=137.88s)]
*  I want to play a clip, but you look like you have a reaction. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=140.16s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=141.76s)]
*  Just the fairness is the thing. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=142.76s)]
*  Just fair. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=143.76s)]
*  Just give us fair. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=144.76s)]
*  Fair is enough. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=145.76s)]
*  Fair is enough. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=146.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=147.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=148.76s)]
*  So if we talk about, we've had a debate about immigration and how could it be done? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=149.76s)]
*  There are ways to do it that are more or less fair, as you just alluded to. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=155.04s)]
*  You talk about child protective services or other rules. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=158.39999999999998s)]
*  Are they enforced fairly or not? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=161.5s)]
*  And so culture sometimes helps us see the humanity. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=163.42s)]
*  That's what you do. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=166.38s)]
*  You create culture. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=167.38s)]
*  You have this track record. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=168.62s)]
*  People years later are quoting your character. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=169.9s)]
*  So let's look at what's a difficult scene here that seems to humanize a mother who might [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=172.46s)]
*  lose custody. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=176.22s)]
*  My daughter is safe with me. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=177.22s)]
*  Teacher and the principal say she comes to school very hungry. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=182.22s)]
*  I work two jobs. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=190.98s)]
*  Okay? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=192.46s)]
*  I work two jobs to make sure we have what we can to eat. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=193.54000000000002s)]
*  What are we seeing there? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=198.38s)]
*  First of all, I'm watching Taraji just play this role. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=199.38s)]
*  Even in the moments when she was doing these scenes, it was just so real, her being a single [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=202.82s)]
*  mother. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=206.74s)]
*  And on her graduation day from Howard University, she took her one-year-old on stage with her [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=207.74s)]
*  because it was like people didn't think I would do it and graduate. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=211.46s)]
*  So she really could relate to this character. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=215.0s)]
*  But what you're seeing there, more than anything, is just a mother who is doing everything she [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=217.10000000000002s)]
*  can and the situation starts to compound and compound. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=220.54s)]
*  Hence the title straw, the final straw that makes it all go left. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=223.54s)]
*  Well, you know what most F.Yassine Bay said? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=227.46s)]
*  Tell me. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=231.22s)]
*  The straw that broke the camel's back, what's the secret? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=233.46s)]
*  A million other straws underneath it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=237.42000000000002s)]
*  Always you, man. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=240.38s)]
*  Always you. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=241.38s)]
*  I can count on you to quote it. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=242.38s)]
*  This film was made quickly. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=244.06s)]
*  How quickly? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=245.38s)]
*  About seven days. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=246.38s)]
*  How does that work? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=248.74s)]
*  I'm not a person that has a whole group of people telling me don't do this, don't do [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=249.98000000000002s)]
*  that, don't. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=254.26000000000002s)]
*  She can't wear this, she can't wear that. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=255.26000000000002s)]
*  It's me making all the decisions. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=257.1s)]
*  So a lot of people that slow down the process are not in my studio. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=258.1s)]
*  So we get to work and we knock it out and make it happen. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=261.6s)]
*  I got to say as a creator, shout out to being able to say my studio because I don't think [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=264.74s)]
*  everyone always realizes even acclaimed directors, someone like you a few years back or many [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=269.6s)]
*  others that we see, every time they want to do a project, they're still, before they even [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=274.98s)]
*  get started, looking for approval, money, rules, and then what you just mentioned, creative [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=279.54s)]
*  interference. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=284.1s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, no, I don't have any of that. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=285.1s)]
*  Respect. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=286.90000000000003s)]
*  I don't have any of that. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=287.90000000000003s)]
*  I've had great partnerships over the years and that have proved extremely lucrative for [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=289.14000000000004s)]
*  everybody I've been in business with, from TBS to Turner to Lionsgate to Netflix to Amazon, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=292.86s)]
*  you name it, to OWN to Oprah, everywhere I've gone, it's been extremely lucrative for the [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=299.42s)]
*  companies and I think people know the bottom line. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=303.54s)]
*  They know what you're buying. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=306.06s)]
*  When you do a contract with me, you're buying a brand that is going to show up. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=307.98s)]
*  My audience is, they're more loyal than country music fans. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=311.42s)]
*  They show up 100 times over and send everything to number one. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=314.58s)]
*  So that's why I think I've been able to make some of the deals that I've been able to make. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=318.9s)]
*  Are you thinking about them, that loyal audience, when you create or do you feel like some artists [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=322.02s)]
*  say, as long as I'm true, they'll be there? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=326.66s)]
*  I feel like I'm doing what they want to see and what they haven't been able to see, see [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=330.26s)]
*  themselves in these situations and I think that's why it's worked so well. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=335.86s)]
*  But you know, Jazz Man's Blues, which is on Netflix, I wrote 27, 28 years ago and it was [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=339.38s)]
*  set in the 1940s and I was afraid to do it for all those years because I was afraid to [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=345.06s)]
*  have a flop. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=348.42s)]
*  So it worked, it became a big success on Netflix, which is great, but which led me to do 6888, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=349.42s)]
*  which let me know that I could spread my wings a little bit and then come back to a medial [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=355.34s)]
*  or something to make sure that my audience is there and fed because that's my focus, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=359.06s)]
*  the audience, not the critics. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=362.86s)]
*  Why was that a flop? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=364.54s)]
*  Risk, to use your word, because it's a period piece? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=366.38s)]
*  Because it was a period piece and because everybody in the industry said period pieces [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=368.62s)]
*  aren't going to work, especially about a black man and woman passing for white during that [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=371.9s)]
*  time. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=376.02s)]
*  So all of those years I held it, but I was so glad I got a chance to do it when I did. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=377.02s)]
*  And after 19 movies, this was the first time I ever fell in love with filmmaking. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=381.04s)]
*  Really? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=384.74s)]
*  Making Jazz Man, yeah. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=385.74s)]
*  It's funny you say that because we've heard from other artists at this table, including [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=386.74s)]
*  musicians who say that the industry feedback is this has never worked before so it can't [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=388.76s)]
*  work, which just as a logical fallacy can't be true because people invent new things all [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=394.64s)]
*  the time. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=401.44s)]
*  If everything had to already have worked, we'd just be doing the same things and who [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=402.44s)]
*  wants to do that? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=405.68s)]
*  Yeah, but you're talking about an industry that always only wants to follow. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=406.68s)]
*  They always, what worked? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=410.12s)]
*  Let's go that way. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=411.12s)]
*  What didn't work? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=412.12s)]
*  Let's go, don't do that. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=413.12s)]
*  So it's very far and few between defined risk takers inside of Hollywood because everybody [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=414.12s)]
*  is trying to follow a trend and I get it. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=418.64s)]
*  Everybody wants to affect their job. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=420.36s)]
*  People know you from different things. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=422.68s)]
*  Your core audience knows you as this, what I call, world creator. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=424.0s)]
*  Other folks just say, oh, he's that actor. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=427.08s)]
*  He's a good actor. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=428.68s)]
*  Or they say, I don't know you. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=430.76s)]
*  Or they don't know you? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=431.76s)]
*  I don't know that many people don't know you. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=432.76s)]
*  No, I was at Hell's Kitchen the other night and watching the Alicia show was fantastic [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=434.47999999999996s)]
*  and this guy turns around because everybody's coming over trying to get pictures. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=437.91999999999996s)]
*  I don't know who you are, but you're really gracious. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=440.56s)]
*  So I just thank that. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=442.8s)]
*  Because he saw the other people. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=443.8s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=444.8s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=445.8s)]
*  I appreciate that. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=446.8s)]
*  Which is the acting. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=447.96000000000004s)]
*  This session has been called to resolve a troubling matter. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=448.96000000000004s)]
*  James T. Kirk, step forward. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=454.16s)]
*  That's where you two are the most fucked up people I've ever known. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=456.04s)]
*  And I specialize in fucked up. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=459.48s)]
*  Carl, I have been very vocal. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=460.96000000000004s)]
*  Very vocal about my reservations about evading Iraq. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=463.40000000000003s)]
*  No, Colin, you're such a nervous Nellie. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=465.64s)]
*  You can't do this. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=468.64s)]
*  It won't stop. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=471.64s)]
*  I've seen his face. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=476.47999999999996s)]
*  You like doing this. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=478.24s)]
*  Your directing makes you better at it. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=479.44s)]
*  And I'm going to ask you the question. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=481.44s)]
*  I know you seem pretty honest so far. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=482.91999999999996s)]
*  Do you have range? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=485.15999999999997s)]
*  I think I do have range more than what I've shown, but I don't like doing it. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=487.15999999999997s)]
*  You don't? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=490.8s)]
*  I don't. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=491.8s)]
*  I'd rather have a costume to hide behind. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=492.8s)]
*  So stepping out to do something like Gone Girl, had I known that David Fincher was who he [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=494.52s)]
*  was and Ben Affleck had done the... [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=498.08s)]
*  I knew the work, but I didn't know how to the degree that they really lean into directing [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=500.40000000000003s)]
*  and understanding everything. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=505.72s)]
*  I would have been intimidated by it. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=507.04s)]
*  I wouldn't have said yes, but I'm glad I did because working with David and Ben was incredible. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=508.36s)]
*  I want to ask you about criticism. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=515.0s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=516.88s)]
*  Your criticism level seems to be higher than other people at your success level. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=518.92s)]
*  Do you agree with that? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=525.36s)]
*  I would absolutely agree. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=526.36s)]
*  I think there are people at my success level. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=528.2s)]
*  Okay, bars. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=530.2800000000001s)]
*  So I just want to read one, if it's all right with you. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=531.88s)]
*  And this is from Ture, who's been around. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=534.24s)]
*  I don't know if he came across this or not. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=536.32s)]
*  But he said Perry is... [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=538.44s)]
*  Well, Liquor for the Masses, is that the one? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=540.36s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=542.08s)]
*  He said Perry's serving an audience that is underserved by Hollywood, he argues. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=543.08s)]
*  And he says, and he's speaking as a black man in America, he says, especially black [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=547.72s)]
*  southern women who don't see themselves in Hollywood fare. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=551.1600000000001s)]
*  He says his grandmother loves this stuff. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=555.36s)]
*  And then he says, quote, I can't watch it without cringing. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=558.44s)]
*  What do you take of that? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=564.28s)]
*  Is it just out of bounds off the whole conversation? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=565.28s)]
*  Or is there something there that you deal with? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=568.6800000000001s)]
*  First of all, he's brilliant. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=570.64s)]
*  Like I've watched him. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=572.28s)]
*  I pay attention to him. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=573.28s)]
*  He's brilliant. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=574.28s)]
*  However, I can understand why he doesn't relate to it because there's a high brow level of [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=575.28s)]
*  Negro who doesn't understand what I do and how I do it. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=580.52s)]
*  And there's this need to look down upon it, to make themselves feel a certain way about [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=583.5999999999999s)]
*  it rather than embracing and understand what it is, because there's a sense of moving away [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=588.3599999999999s)]
*  from where we come from, forgetting that our mothers were actually maids and grandmothers [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=593.0s)]
*  were maids and helped and all the things that we had to do to get us to be in the place [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=597.7399999999999s)]
*  that we're in. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=601.88s)]
*  Now, I don't know about his. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=602.88s)]
*  It's almost like Spike Lee. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=604.16s)]
*  Spike Lee's mother was an educator. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=605.16s)]
*  So I can't relate to that. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=607.06s)]
*  My mother worked at a Jewish community center with preschool kids. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=608.3s)]
*  This is my childhood and my father was a carpenter. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=611.8s)]
*  So my upbringing is very Southern. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=614.04s)]
*  It's very raw. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=615.8s)]
*  It's very guttural. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=616.8s)]
*  It's not the class of sophistication of New York. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=617.8s)]
*  Toray, New York. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=620.0s)]
*  Spike, New York. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=622.12s)]
*  They are allowed to have that. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=623.8399999999999s)]
*  But what it will tell you this. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=624.92s)]
*  Langston Hughes said that Zora Neuhörsten was a new version of the darkie because she [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=626.7199999999999s)]
*  spoke in a Southern dialect. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=630.4s)]
*  So you look at the two of them who brilliant in both their ways, but they also had their [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=632.16s)]
*  opinions. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=636.4399999999999s)]
*  I can't fix them. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=637.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm glad I asked because it's such an interesting answer and you explore this culture. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=639.08s)]
*  You give voice to this culture. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=643.76s)]
*  And so my follow up question to that hearing you say it is, is there this double standard [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=644.84s)]
*  where America, which has been enriched by so many of its diverse inhabitants, but is [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=649.5600000000001s)]
*  still as we've seen in politics, predominantly this white overclass. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=655.64s)]
*  Is there a double standard where white Americans are celebrated and encouraged to get as down [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=661.96s)]
*  into the Tennessee cowboy, that culture. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=668.24s)]
*  And then you're saying that there's a version of black success in culture that requires [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=673.5600000000001s)]
*  you to somehow leave something behind. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=679.36s)]
*  Why should anyone have to do that? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=682.0s)]
*  Well, exactly. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=683.2s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=684.2s)]
*  You said exactly right. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=685.2s)]
*  And I think that if we were to, as black people, embrace all the different sides and shades [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=686.2s)]
*  of us and everywhere we've come from, we'd have a better appreciation for understanding [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=691.48s)]
*  that every, every one of us, we're not a monolith. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=694.88s)]
*  Every one of us has our own stories and every one of our stories deserve to be told. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=697.28s)]
*  The stories I'm talking about, Medea, that's my mother and my aunt, you know, and Mr. Brown [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=701.32s)]
*  with his Ashen kneecaps. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=705.6800000000001s)]
*  That's my uncle James Bell. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=706.76s)]
*  So these are real people who had lives, who had great stories to tell. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=707.96s)]
*  So I feel like I would be doing a disservice to shut that down and not talk about the things [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=711.76s)]
*  that all of these people went through and endured because there's a certain level of [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=716.28s)]
*  Negro who thinks that it shouldn't be mentioned. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=720.64s)]
*  Yeah, really interesting. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=723.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=724.84s)]
*  I want to remind people we have Medea, I believe over the years, across some different films. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=725.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=729.5600000000001s)]
*  Since you mentioned it, let's take a look. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=730.5600000000001s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=731.5600000000001s)]
*  I mentioned it, but you didn't have to show it. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=732.5600000000001s)]
*  What was he doing? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=735.84s)]
*  He was... [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=736.84s)]
*  Hey! [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=737.84s)]
*  You lucky you didn't swallow them bastards. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=738.84s)]
*  Have them go in there chewing up your sausage. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=741.84s)]
*  I say half everything, it ain't him belong to her. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=744.84s)]
*  Which half do you want? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=746.84s)]
*  Do you want this half? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=747.84s)]
*  Do you want this half? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=748.84s)]
*  You say, yes, ma'am, to me. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=752.84s)]
*  Yes, ma'am. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=754.84s)]
*  He say, yes, ma'am. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=757.84s)]
*  The hell y'all looking at? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=760.84s)]
*  It's Christmas and I'm taking what the hell I want up in here. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=761.84s)]
*  This is a nice lighter. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=769.84s)]
*  Well, I'm watching you watch it. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=772.84s)]
*  You're laughing, you're shaking your head. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=773.84s)]
*  I mean, people share things. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=775.84s)]
*  Saturday Night Live is something that people shared over the decades. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=777.84s)]
*  And if you go back far enough, it didn't include everybody. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=781.84s)]
*  This is a different piece of culture that people share and laugh at and come back to, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=784.84s)]
*  as you know, because it's what, 30 films and a billion dollars deep. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=788.84s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I can't let it go. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=792.84s)]
*  They still want to see it. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=793.84s)]
*  But unfortunately, I carry the stigma of, you know, Mel Brooks and his characters or [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=794.84s)]
*  Mrs. Doubtfire, they don't carry the stigma of, oh, Tyler, you're making every black man [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=799.84s)]
*  look bad, you're masculine by doing this character. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=803.84s)]
*  But for me, it's simply what it is. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=806.84s)]
*  It's fun, it's entertainment. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=808.84s)]
*  I'm an actor and just like I'm playing Tanner Bolt in Gone Girl, it's the same thing. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=809.84s)]
*  You give me this costume, I'm going to be what it is. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=814.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=816.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=817.84s)]
*  We also noticed, again, because you've done so much, that there's a lot of actors who [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=818.84s)]
*  like working with you in an industry where it's very common on record or in blind quotes [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=821.84s)]
*  to hear about how tough it is because of the systemic pressures or because of the way, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=826.84s)]
*  I guess, some directors are, and I'm sure it's hard to pull off a giant project, right? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=831.84s)]
*  Here's some specifically, we've heard from some actresses talking about working with [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=835.84s)]
*  you. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=840.84s)]
*  I want to play that for you. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=841.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=842.84s)]
*  Why would I say no to Tyler Perry? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=843.84s)]
*  And he is passionate. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=845.84s)]
*  Like he comes to me with projects that work for me, that work that are specifically great [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=847.84s)]
*  for my town. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=852.84s)]
*  Tyler's been such a support for me throughout my career. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=853.84s)]
*  Like at a time earlier in my career where I was like, I'm done acting, I don't think [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=856.84s)]
*  I want to do this anymore, he called me to be in For Colored Girls, beautiful film, and [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=859.84s)]
*  I worked with so many of my heroes. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=863.84s)]
*  The question is, is that just happening because that's your approach or is this more deliberate [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=866.84s)]
*  because your charity work, what you've discussed in your own life about going through things [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=872.84s)]
*  and then trying to help other people, and maybe that's not the right way to divide it, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=878.84s)]
*  but how does this come about and is it an affirmative approach? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=882.84s)]
*  I think it's both. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=885.84s)]
*  I think that I've been given this platform and this moment in time to be able to make [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=886.84s)]
*  these projects and tell these stories and to have an opportunity to work with some of [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=890.84s)]
*  these incredibly talented women and men. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=893.84s)]
*  I mean, Viola Davis, and I can go down the list of all these people that came through [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=896.84s)]
*  the Tyler Perry camp at some point or another before they hit these different milestones. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=900.84s)]
*  So it feels wonderful to be able to do that, to be able to hold that, to take the door [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=905.84s)]
*  that I was able to break through and make it a platform for somebody else to come through. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=909.84s)]
*  So that feels great. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=913.84s)]
*  And you've heard that from them directly as well because they're out there saying it. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=914.84s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=917.84s)]
*  And Idris Elba, there's a ton of them and I really, really appreciate it. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=918.84s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=921.84s)]
*  I want to ask you about the political environment we're in and then a little bit of lightning [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=922.84s)]
*  around. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=926.84s)]
*  You said you've seen the beats, so maybe you've seen we ask people to do that. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=927.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=929.84s)]
*  You're very empowered because you've built power and wealth and prestige and success, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=930.84s)]
*  as we've shown. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=935.84s)]
*  So you've been using that in various ways. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=936.84s)]
*  You campaigned for Harris. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=938.84s)]
*  You've also at times suggested that there's a way to do this and you can't do it all at [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=939.84s)]
*  once overnight and not expect a backlash. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=943.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=945.84s)]
*  So Blue Sky, as we say, I know you're promoting a movie, you've got other stuff, but Blue [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=946.84s)]
*  Sky, the environment we're in right now in this second term of this president, crackdowns [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=949.84s)]
*  on artists, crackdowns on DEI. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=954.84s)]
*  What do you see here? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=957.84s)]
*  I'm extremely concerned about this assault on the rule of law is the biggest thing that [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=958.84s)]
*  has me concerned right away because if that's eroded and gone away, we end up in a constitutional [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=965.84s)]
*  crisis, then it's over. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=969.84s)]
*  What do we have? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=970.84s)]
*  And so many things are leaning to this administration's favor when it comes to the Supreme Court [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=972.84s)]
*  and some of the decisions that have been made. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=978.84s)]
*  Sure. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=979.84s)]
*  It's been mind boggling to me that I'm just blown away that someone could actually do [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=980.84s)]
*  this. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=986.84s)]
*  And I know that if Obama had done any of this, any of it, he wore a tan suit and it was a [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=987.84s)]
*  scandal, this entire country who supported him would have been in uproar. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=993.84s)]
*  If he freed violent insurrections, who would serve in 20-year terms for sedition. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=998.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1003.84s)]
*  And knowing how much I paid in taxes is even this year. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1004.84s)]
*  It's just like to just free someone who's tax evasion, it's so unfair to the people [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1009.84s)]
*  who are doing it right. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1015.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1016.84s)]
*  Well, Hov, there's a line, maybe it could apply to you since you told me you like some [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1017.84s)]
*  of the lines. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1020.84s)]
*  We don't shoot at the same baskets. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1022.84s)]
*  We're not in the same bracket. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1025.8400000000001s)]
*  And I feel like you could say that to most people who pay taxes right now. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1027.84s)]
*  I really want to film that and send it to Hov so he can see you saying it. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1030.84s)]
*  And you've got to be proud of it to be at that level. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1034.84s)]
*  All right, lightning round is pretty fun. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1037.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1039.84s)]
*  All right. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1040.84s)]
*  Atlanta or New Orleans? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1041.84s)]
*  Ooh. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1043.84s)]
*  Ooh. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1044.84s)]
*  Atlanta because New Orleans was the backdrop for me getting everything I needed to make [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1045.84s)]
*  it in Atlanta. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1050.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1051.84s)]
*  Directing or writing? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1052.84s)]
*  Writing. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1054.84s)]
*  I can do it alone by myself, singularly. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1055.84s)]
*  Get it done. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1057.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1058.84s)]
*  Finish this sentence. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1059.84s)]
*  The industry still doesn't get that. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1060.84s)]
*  Us. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1064.84s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1065.84s)]
*  When they said no, I... [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1066.84s)]
*  Blew the roof off the place. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1071.84s)]
*  If I, Tyler Perry, was going to reboot one classic film... [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1075.84s)]
*  Ooh. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1079.84s)]
*  Wow. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1080.84s)]
*  Claudine. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1081.84s)]
*  Claudine. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1082.84s)]
*  Claudine. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1083.84s)]
*  The most important thing I learned from Oprah is... [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1084.84s)]
*  Everything. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1088.84s)]
*  No, one thing. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1089.84s)]
*  Everything. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1090.84s)]
*  Every single thing. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1091.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1092.84s)]
*  The difference between vision and hustle is... [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1093.84s)]
*  The amount of time you put into each. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1098.84s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1100.84s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1101.84s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1102.84s)]
*  Final four. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1103.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1104.84s)]
*  I thought it was over when... [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1105.84s)]
*  When nobody showed up to the first show. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1107.84s)]
*  A play or... [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1111.84s)]
*  A play, yeah. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1112.84s)]
*  I thought 1,200 people would show up over the weekend, and 30 showed up. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1113.84s)]
*  I was like, thanks, Zoe, but my rent payment, car payment's in it. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1116.84s)]
*  I ended up homeless. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1119.84s)]
*  That's... [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1120.84s)]
*  So you were making art, but you're looking at the empty... [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1121.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1123.84s)]
*  Nearly empty stands, and then you're not able to support yourself. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1124.84s)]
*  But I'd always had this twin brain of knowing that the two have to work together, the business [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1127.84s)]
*  and the show. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1131.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1132.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1133.84s)]
*  Mm. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1134.84s)]
*  I knew I'd made it when... [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1135.84s)]
*  I knew I'd made it when The Color Purple premiered on Broadway, and I walked out of the back [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1136.84s)]
*  of the venue. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1141.84s)]
*  First, Oprah went out, and the crowd goes crazy. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1142.84s)]
*  Oprah, then Tina Turner walks out. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1144.84s)]
*  Tina, Tina. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1146.84s)]
*  Then I walk out, and they go, Tyler, Tyler. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1147.84s)]
*  I was like, whoa. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1148.84s)]
*  Oprah, Tina, Tyler. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1149.84s)]
*  Yeah, I think I did all right. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1150.84s)]
*  Wow. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1153.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1154.84s)]
*  Failure means... [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1155.84s)]
*  Failure means try another way. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1156.84s)]
*  And success means... [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1160.84s)]
*  Success means... [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1162.72s)]
*  Hm. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1164.84s)]
*  Still work like you're broke. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1166.52s)]
*  Still work like you're broke. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1167.84s)]
*  Still work like you're broke. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1168.84s)]
*  I still work like I'm broke. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1169.84s)]
*  Tyler Perry, thank you so much for coming on the show. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1170.84s)]
*  My pleasure, man. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVfn7uMb4s&t=1171.84s)]
