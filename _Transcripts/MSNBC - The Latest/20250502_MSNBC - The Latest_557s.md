# ‘Bizarre situation’: Trump removes Waltz as National Security Adviser, nominates him for U.N. Amb.
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU)
*  With us now, NBC News White House correspondent Vaughn Hilliard, MSNBC military analyst, retired [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=0.0s)]
*  general Barry McCaffrey, and former Florida Congressman Carlos Curbelo, who is also an [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=5.78s)]
*  MSNBC political analyst. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=9.6s)]
*  So Vaughn, what do we know on what made the president decide to do this now? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=11.28s)]
*  Well, we have heard far from a full throat a defense of Michael Waltz, his national security [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=17.48s)]
*  advisor over the last weeks since the initial Signalgate debacle took place. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=23.44s)]
*  And we saw in images during his cabinet meeting just 48 hours ago inside of the White House, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=29.08s)]
*  Mike Waltz using Signal to communicate with Tulsi Gabbard, Vice President Vance. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=35.64s)]
*  And we know that Michael Waltz was somebody who was always perceived quite skeptically [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=42.16s)]
*  by some more MAGA anti-interventionist foreign policy allies of the president, not only during [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  the 2024 campaign, but during the transition. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=55.4s)]
*  But we saw the former Green Beret and the former Florida Congressman Mike Waltz continually [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=58.16s)]
*  hit the road with the president and ultimately earn his confidence. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=63.36s)]
*  But just over three months in, losing his job notably during the first Trump administration, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=67.92s)]
*  Jose, he went through four national security advisors. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=72.96s)]
*  And in fact, this go around, he's lasting longer than his first one back in 2017, Michael [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=76.36s)]
*  Flynn, who only lasted three weeks. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=81.06s)]
*  But that said, this does not appear to be an outsized firing per se, but he has been [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=82.8s)]
*  promoted in the words of J.D. Vance, given a what will be Senate confirmed position to [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=88.0s)]
*  be the ambassador to the United Nations. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=93.0s)]
*  And so, Carlos, do you see this as a promotion? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=96.44s)]
*  I mean, the fact that Waltz stepped aside from his congressional seat in Florida, so [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=98.84s)]
*  many things. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=105.36s)]
*  How do you see this? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=106.96s)]
*  Jose, at best, this is a lateral move. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=107.96s)]
*  Look, any time you're getting kicked out of the West Wing, you're going from a place [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=110.6s)]
*  where you're making policy in the West Wing, that's what they do, to somewhere where you're [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=115.16s)]
*  implementing policy. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=120.0s)]
*  So this is an important role, UN ambassador. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=121.36s)]
*  I mean, this is not necessarily a demotion, but certainly Mike Waltz will now be more [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=123.44s)]
*  removed from the center of power in this administration and he won't be making policy. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=129.2s)]
*  He will be implementing the policies made by the president, Marco Rubio and others. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=134.56s)]
*  And I guess he could use the Signal app a lot easier. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=140.0s)]
*  Less scrutiny, for sure. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=144.84s)]
*  Less scrutiny. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=145.84s)]
*  General McAfee, President Biden's National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, reacted to [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=146.84s)]
*  the news this morning. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=150.44s)]
*  Here's part of what he said. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=151.44s)]
*  We have a very competitive world out there and we need a full team on the field. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=152.44s)]
*  So we need somebody in that National Security Advisor job, frankly, who has the trust of [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  the president, but also who can step up and deal with this array of challenges. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=162.96s)]
*  General, what's the time, the focus, the study commitment for a National Security Advisor [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=168.92000000000002s)]
*  to the president? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=174.96s)]
*  Well, look, Jose, I've been to dozens and dozens of national security meetings, either [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=177.6s)]
*  as the principal or as a backup to the chairman of the JCS. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=182.12s)]
*  The coordination of the NFC by the actual senior advisor and his deputy is vitally important. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=187.72s)]
*  It's not just when the secretary of defense and state and treasury are in the room. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=195.96s)]
*  It's when the three stars and their equivalent and the various departments of government [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=201.44s)]
*  come together to hash out the hundred or more vital national security concerns, foreign [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=206.64000000000001s)]
*  policy, that are facing us on any given day or week. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=213.32s)]
*  So this is a bizarre situation. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=218.64000000000001s)]
*  Trump basically conducts all foreign policy by whim himself. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=220.92s)]
*  He's got separate envoys to Russia, to North Korea, to Ukraine. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=227.2s)]
*  So it's an odd situation. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=232.67999999999998s)]
*  And certainly sending the U.N. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=235.0s)]
*  ambassador as somebody you fired in the White House is also an unusual signal. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=237.72s)]
*  Yeah, General Marco Rubio apparently now has four jobs. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=244.48s)]
*  Secretary of State, the acting National Security Advisor, acting administrator of USAID and [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=249.72s)]
*  also in charge of the archives of the United States. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=256.2s)]
*  What are some of the major challenges Secretary Rubio could face doing all of these jobs? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=259.0s)]
*  Well, it's not doable. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=263.88s)]
*  I mean, look, you have an NFC meeting. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=266.68s)]
*  Somebody's got to chair the meeting. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=269.68s)]
*  The Secretary of State is the guy and then gets on a plane and goes to Japan that afternoon. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=271.08000000000004s)]
*  There's simply no way to pull together a whole of government effort. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=277.96000000000004s)]
*  And by the way, Mike Walsh had a terrific reputation. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=282.56s)]
*  He was a genuine combat, decorated for valor, special forces colonel, congressman, successful [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=287.04s)]
*  businessman who's actually quite good up until the moment where he embarrassed Trump. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=295.56s)]
*  And by the way, I think this entire Trump government has zero attention to operational [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=303.0s)]
*  security, the nation's most precious secrets. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=309.28000000000003s)]
*  So somebody had to go and they pay. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=312.96s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the fact that these operational secrets and, you know, I guess basic 101 [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=316.28s)]
*  operational secrets handling general, the fact that Walsh, although he didn't create [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=321.28s)]
*  that signal chat, he was a part of it. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=327.88s)]
*  And now we see as long as telling us that just 48 hours ago in the cabinet meeting, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=331.84s)]
*  he was in the White House cabinet room, you know, using that that signal app. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=336.44s)]
*  And it looks as though he's having conversations who knows what about but with Secretary State [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=344.28s)]
*  Rubio, with with Gabbard, with with the vice president. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=348.92s)]
*  I mean, what do you see as the just concerns about that basic part? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=352.44s)]
*  Well, I think it's government is such a good deal for foreign intelligence operations [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=360.12s)]
*  beyond belief. There's no question they were using signal across government. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=364.28s)]
*  There weren't just two conversations without question. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=369.52s)]
*  And the biggest offender, by the way, is the secretary of defense, who has in his office [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=373.32s)]
*  a secured skiff area, has his personal computer, a separate dirty line, and he's using [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=377.88s)]
*  his cell phone, which is widely known that the SEC has telephone number all over the [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=385.8s)]
*  world. So they're they're treating this thing in a cavalier manner. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=390.92s)]
*  You know, if you can listen to the innermost secrets of an administration, your ability [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=397.4s)]
*  to negotiate, to make plans is transparent. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=403.64s)]
*  It's an outrageous situation. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=407.71999999999997s)]
*  But the biggest offender was the secretary of defense, not the NSA. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=409.8s)]
*  And neither. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=414.28s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, God, Mike Waltz could face a brutal Senate confirmation process. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=416.32s)]
*  Why put him up for a Senate confirmed position, you think? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=420.76s)]
*  Yeah, also, I think after a controversy of the nature that Mike Waltz just went through [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=423.56s)]
*  to have to go and face United States Senator now, that is going to be a tall task. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=429.32000000000005s)]
*  Some people say, well, they tried to make this elegant. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=434.20000000000005s)]
*  Well, sure, they did not fire Mike Waltz. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=437.16s)]
*  They moved him to a different position, but they set him up for some very difficult [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=439.64000000000004s)]
*  hearings in the United States Senate. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=445.72s)]
*  So that's going to be a big challenge for him. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=447.56s)]
*  And by the way, I don't think we should just assume that he is going to be confirmed. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=449.12s)]
*  And Vaughn, is there a list or an understanding of some of the people the president is [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=454.0s)]
*  considering to fill that role permanently? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=458.36s)]
*  Right. Well, potentially Marco Rubio could stay in this capacity for a period of time. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=461.24s)]
*  But also you would have to look at Steve Witkoff, somebody that the president is keenly [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=466.2s)]
*  trusting of, somebody who does not have national security experience, to be clear. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=472.04s)]
*  But somebody I was talking with, a diplomat from a Middle Eastern country here. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=477.08000000000004s)]
*  And the way that they told me was if they know if they want to get the ear of the [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=481.56s)]
*  president of the United States, they go to Suzy Wiles or Steve Witkoff. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=485.0s)]
*  It wasn't Marco Rubio or Michael Waltz, but it's Steve Witkoff. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=489.72s)]
*  And that goes a long ways inside of a White House that is run by Donald Trump. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=493.56s)]
*  But also you're looking at Rick Grinnell, who is the one time acting director of [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=498.36s)]
*  national intelligence in the first Trump administration, former ambassador to Germany, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=502.12s)]
*  somebody who is a special envoy for different interest matters that arise to the level of [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=506.28s)]
*  interest from the president, including, for example, getting some hostages out of Venezuela [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=513.0s)]
*  that he was engaged in. He's a much more brash figure. He's somebody that's close to Cash [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=518.04s)]
*  Patel. Of course, Lee Stefanik at a point in time in which the House is more comfortable with the [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=521.96s)]
*  Republican majority. She is now just down the hill. She is no longer the nominee to be a UN [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=526.28s)]
*  ambassador. So she could potentially be tapped for that role. So there are a lot of different [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=531.56s)]
*  directions that the president could go. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZHUnkK_KdU&t=535.8s)]
