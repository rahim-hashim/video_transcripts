# Stage IV cancer survivor: 'There's reason to be hopeful' about Biden's cancer diagnosis
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U)
*  We are back now with our breaking news. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=0.0s)]
*  Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=4.84s)]
*  NBC News is reporting that the former president and his family have been meeting with doctors [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=9.96s)]
*  and considering multiple treatment options, including hormone treatment. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=14.52s)]
*  And literally moments ago, we got reaction from a very close ally of the former president, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=19.52s)]
*  Congressman James Clyburn. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=24.64s)]
*  He posted, quote, I am saddened to learn of my dear friend, President Joe Biden's prostate [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=26.72s)]
*  cancer diagnosis. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=32.28s)]
*  My heartfelt prayers are with him and his family during this time. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=33.8s)]
*  We know Joe and he has always been a fighter and a faithful man of courage. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=37.96s)]
*  I joined the nation in wishing him the utmost resilience, strength and a full recovery. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=42.96s)]
*  Joe, we are with you. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=48.64s)]
*  Joining us now to discuss all of this is MSNBC contributor, Jonathan Alter. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=51.4s)]
*  Jonathan, thanks so much for being here. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=56.28s)]
*  What are you learning and hearing about the diagnosis? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=58.36s)]
*  Well, you know, I'm a stage four cancer survivor myself. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=61.72s)]
*  I'm 21 years out. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=67.04s)]
*  And so I think it's important when people hear that a former president Biden has a stage [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=69.44s)]
*  for metastatic cancer, they tend to assume it's a death sentence. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=76.12s)]
*  And it's important not to do that. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=83.8s)]
*  Cancer treatment has come a long way in recent years. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=86.6s)]
*  And so there's reason to be hopeful. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=91.32s)]
*  He is a fighter and we should not lose heart. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=94.4s)]
*  I had a different kind of cancer than he does. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  But you know, he has, according to what one can learn about this aggressive form of prostate [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=103.2s)]
*  cancer, he has about a 30 percent five year survival rate. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=111.64s)]
*  And that could be it could be worse. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=117.16s)]
*  So I think we just have to hope that somebody has to be in the good percentages. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=121.0s)]
*  It might as well be Joe Biden. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=128.08s)]
*  He's a man of great decency and integrity. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=129.72s)]
*  And I think an awful lot of people in this country are rooting for him. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=133.12s)]
*  Jonathan, you know, I'm kind of almost embarrassed to ask this question, but you know, you covered [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=139.32s)]
*  Washington, D.C. in politics, you know, the vitriol that exists in Washington, D.C. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=143.4s)]
*  Are you surprised by the overwhelming outpouring of sympathy from across the aisle from Republicans [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=148.56s)]
*  to this man, including the current president and some of his political rivals in the Republican [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=154.44s)]
*  Party? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=159.08s)]
*  No, I'm actually not that surprised by it, because I think that beneath the vitriol, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=162.0s)]
*  there are a lot of Americans and a lot of politicians on both sides who want to get [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=169.16s)]
*  back to a sense of decency. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=174.56s)]
*  Now, I don't actually think that Donald Trump will be able to contain himself for very long. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=176.88s)]
*  And I think it's only a matter of a few weeks, maybe days before he's back to sliming Joe [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=184.92000000000002s)]
*  Biden again, which he's been doing for many years. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=191.0s)]
*  But at least now, in the immediate aftermath, people are trying to bring forth the better [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=194.48s)]
*  angels of their natures. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=202.0s)]
*  All right, Jonathan Alter, thank you so much for that. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=203.32s)]
*  Greatly appreciate it. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=205.64s)]
*  It's good to see you, as always. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=206.64s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=207.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3RdxrAD0U&t=224.44s)]
