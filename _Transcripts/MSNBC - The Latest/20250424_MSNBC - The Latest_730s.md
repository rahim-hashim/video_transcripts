# Raid the shelves? Trump’s failed trade war stokes panic, 47’s polls crash below Obama, Biden, Bush
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A)
*  So, the new polls show Americans overwhelmingly rejecting Trump's governing so far. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=0.0s)]
*  The public not only souring on his overall leadership and economic problems, but actually [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=5.96s)]
*  doing so across the board. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=9.66s)]
*  Let me show you. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  A new survey from Pew shows Trump is underwater no matter how you divide up the nation, which, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  as you know in politics, people often do. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=18.5s)]
*  So he's underwater with women and men, across racial groups, with younger and older voters, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=20.96s)]
*  Even across the education gap, which you probably heard has become a bigger gap between the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=26.66s)]
*  parties lately. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=32.42s)]
*  Democrats have struggled with voters who didn't go to college, but non-college and college [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=33.7s)]
*  grads, both groups, oppose what they've seen so far. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=38.34s)]
*  These findings are just a really long ways from the campaign era. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=44.06s)]
*  Now, you remember, Democrats faced those incumbent headwinds. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=47.42s)]
*  They also swapped in a new candidate later than any other presidential race in history. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=51.1s)]
*  For all the bluster, I mentioned that tonight, because it might seem like ancient history, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=56.06s)]
*  but even that was a close national race. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=59.74s)]
*  Trump won by under two points. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=61.940000000000005s)]
*  He had about 50 percent of the total vote. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=63.74s)]
*  We're not going to do a lot of math tonight, but with these new polls and their ricocheting [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=65.98s)]
*  in Mago World and on Fox, keep that November number in mind, 50 percent. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=69.54s)]
*  Because maybe the idea of Trump after four years off last November was more appealing [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=75.18s)]
*  to more people than what we're now living through, which is the president actually governing. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=81.78s)]
*  Ninety-five days in, Trump has basically fallen to 40 percent. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=86.62s)]
*  So 50 in November, now crashing to 40, and they're just getting started. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=90.62s)]
*  This is supposed to be the honeymoon time. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=95.28s)]
*  These polls are driving rough headlines about weakening Trump's mandate already. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=97.66s)]
*  And there are some other numbers that show how it does get even worse when you dig in [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=101.86s)]
*  or go into the cross tabs, as I mentioned, going deep into the numbers. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=105.54s)]
*  But before I even get to those, I just want to show you up top here how this Trump polling [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=108.98s)]
*  slump, which is also reflected in a new Fox poll where you see the majority disapprove, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=113.89999999999999s)]
*  according to Fox News' pollster, on basically every issue. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=120.98s)]
*  You can see that. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=124.7s)]
*  Border security is the only one where a majority actually approves. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=125.7s)]
*  Wide disapproval on Fox, that's their poll, makes it harder for them to ignore it. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=128.98s)]
*  And here's how that played across that usually Mago-friendly channel. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=132.94s)]
*  The polls, you know, they're not extraordinary. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=139.42s)]
*  Job approval compared to other presidents. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=141.98s)]
*  There you see the president at 44 percent and you see his first term at 45 percent. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=144.3s)]
*  It's actually behind where Joe Biden was. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=150.5s)]
*  I don't think the stock market and today's polls are the best measurement. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=152.62s)]
*  When it comes to the economy, this is where it's a little trickier and this is where his [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=156.18s)]
*  numbers have gone south. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=159.74s)]
*  Only 28 percent say the economy is excellent or good. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=160.94s)]
*  He is underwater when it comes to the economy, tariffs and inflation. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=164.22s)]
*  So think about what's happening there, pretty straightforward. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=168.98s)]
*  That's what the people out there are thinking based on multiple surveys. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=171.06s)]
*  I showed you multiple groups of people across any way you cut it up, including politically. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=174.7s)]
*  That's what they're telling pollsters. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=179.46s)]
*  And because that includes the Fox pollster, Fox can't just ignore their own poll and work, right? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=180.57999999999998s)]
*  Maybe it'll get less play late in the evening, depending on the host, but they are. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=185.7s)]
*  And you can say a credit to some of the hosts who did deal with the news. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=189.62s)]
*  They're covering this. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=192.57999999999998s)]
*  So the people say, this isn't what we voted for. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=193.5s)]
*  This isn't what we want. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=196.1s)]
*  We don't want this type of governance from Trump, even if they are, many of the people, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=197.94s)]
*  more conservative, more likely to give him the benefit of the doubt. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=201.34s)]
*  That's still what they're saying. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=203.74s)]
*  And then Fox says that back to the Fox audience in Magelworld. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=204.54s)]
*  And you get this cycle of this reality. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=208.38s)]
*  Now, the economic problems are clearly driving the swiftest rise in the opposition to Trump. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=210.78s)]
*  And history shows this early period is supposed to be virtually always as the high point in [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=214.9s)]
*  approval for a second term president, because presidents typically enter office with the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=221.82s)]
*  groundswell of support, usually from their recent election that, quote, wanes over time, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=226.3s)]
*  as the New York Times puts it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=230.62s)]
*  So Trump's approval has actually been dropping slightly faster than his predecessors. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=232.02s)]
*  And across Trump's two terms, separated, of course, by Biden, Trump has the dubious record [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=237.14000000000001s)]
*  of the, quote, lowest approval rating for a president in modern history. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=241.58s)]
*  So. What do we do with this? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=251.42000000000002s)]
*  We have this politician who has power, but who is also widely opposed, historically unpopular, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=256.1s)]
*  and who I will remind you, and this might sound like one of those criticisms or burns, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=262.74s)]
*  but it's not. It's just literally the numbers as we've gone through this together as a country. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=267.42s)]
*  I will remind you, Trump's not only historically unpopular compared to those other presidents [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=271.34000000000003s)]
*  in all modern era. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=275.74s)]
*  He also got fewer votes in 2016 and in 2020, and then had that narrow finish that I mentioned [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=277.7s)]
*  last November. And yet you have this round of bad polls. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=284.98s)]
*  And for many people, it almost lands like a like a surprise. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=288.66s)]
*  As if the Trump show and the PR and the spectacle have slowly worked on some people to confuse [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=293.34000000000003s)]
*  them about what is his actual condition, a very unpopular, sometimes reviled figure [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=299.74s)]
*  for how he talks about people, for how he treats people, for the type of leadership [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=307.26s)]
*  he offers and for how he runs the government and the economy. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=311.58000000000004s)]
*  So the evidence actually reinforces how facts are different than spectacle. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=315.34000000000003s)]
*  If you want to grade him on a PR or spectacle curve, and that's part of politics, certainly [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=320.02000000000004s)]
*  part of our Internet televised politics, you could say he is effective at that. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=324.46000000000004s)]
*  And there's so much spectacle and so many storylines, and I'm not the first or the last [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=329.14000000000004s)]
*  to note this, that sometimes it does distract from the baseline, which is that he, his ideas [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=332.78000000000003s)]
*  and leadership and the president version of him, the first and second term, all together [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=338.7s)]
*  are extremely unpopular with most people. Now, by the end, let's be clear. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=344.74s)]
*  President Biden's term wasn't viewed as some high watermark of popularity either. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=351.06s)]
*  There were the tense times after covid and the readjustments to that economically. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=355.86s)]
*  There was Jan six, which, of course, was caused by the right, but was a fissure across our [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=359.41999999999996s)]
*  politics and many other things that were not by any means going great in the Biden [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=364.58s)]
*  era. We covered that at the time. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=369.46s)]
*  But I mentioned that right now for a comparison that also happens to be bad for the current [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=372.02s)]
*  president. Biden went out as a leader who did overstay his welcome, according to his [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=375.85999999999996s)]
*  own Democratic Party. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=380.78s)]
*  So keep that in mind when you consider this fact also in the new polling. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=383.06s)]
*  Donald Trump is now doing worse than that. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=388.09999999999997s)]
*  You call it the Biden standard. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=391.62s)]
*  Biden had positive numbers at this point in his term, as did other presidents in both [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=393.7s)]
*  parties. So anyone who wants to slag Biden or say, gosh, at least we're not there. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=397.58s)]
*  You hear that from some Republicans. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=403.1s)]
*  Well, politically, actually, you are there. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=404.22s)]
*  You're worse. Trump has struggled in both terms, even in the early 95 day kind of honeymoon [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=407.02s)]
*  period. So that's what we're hearing from the public. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=413.3s)]
*  This young Trump second term also has courted more formal pushback, not just the surveys [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=416.86s)]
*  or the general sort of public opinion, which does matter in politics, but this rejection [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=422.3s)]
*  we're seeing across Wall Street, which is normally pro-Republican across top law firms. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=426.3s)]
*  These are the people who, of course, form a type of leadership in our country, whether [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=431.5s)]
*  you want to make lawyer jokes or not. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=434.65999999999997s)]
*  They are the people who litigate and debate and represent a lot of the largest companies [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=436.3s)]
*  in the country and the big disputes run through them and up to the courts. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=441.42s)]
*  They're pushing back against what they see as Donald Trump's attack on the very fundamental [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=445.34s)]
*  right to counsel. They also, when you talk about elite politics, the firms tend to represent [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=449.65999999999997s)]
*  a lot of moneyed interests. But there are many of them going against Trump because they [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=454.29999999999995s)]
*  say he's undercutting key rights. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=458.82s)]
*  And then there's civil society in general, where it's no surprise we have the professionals, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=461.02s)]
*  the academics, the scientists. Basically, everyone committed professionally or otherwise [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=464.29999999999995s)]
*  to some level of facts or objective reality. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=468.29999999999995s)]
*  Well, they've been pushing back in all sorts of ways. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=472.53999999999996s)]
*  Then you have the courts, where even having three of his own appointees on the Supreme [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=475.53999999999996s)]
*  Court did not spare Trump a 7-2 loss last weekend on the core issue of whether he is [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=480.97999999999996s)]
*  abusing and exceeding his executive power. All three of his appointees ruled against [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=486.85999999999996s)]
*  him. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=493.34s)]
*  Now, we haven't got to the final resolution of that case, so in all fairness, we're going [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=494.34s)]
*  to have to see what happens, but that was an extraordinary weekend rebuke, and it wasn't [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=497.06s)]
*  close, 7-2. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=501.1s)]
*  All right. That's the bad polling. That's the politics of it. That's some other indicators [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=503.06s)]
*  I've just given you a lot. But I have a little more, and it does involve pizza. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=507.3s)]
*  There are the Trump voters, and the data shows that many Trump voters are loyal to him, even [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=514.02s)]
*  if they're concerned about these economic problems. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=519.26s)]
*  But you don't drop 10 percent from your November election results, by definition, without leaving [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=522.22s)]
*  behind and losing the support of some of these Trump voters. They're upset. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=526.94s)]
*  The disapproval numbers that I'm telling you about, which are on Fox News just like they're [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=531.6600000000001s)]
*  in Pew, mean that Trump voters now disapprove, some of them, of Trump's first 95 days. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=535.22s)]
*  Politically, that doesn't tell you the future. They could still come back to the Republican [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=541.5s)]
*  Party. But it shows that they are observing and living this. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=545.22s)]
*  Many people can see and feel that it's not just that Trump's having a rough start. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=550.86s)]
*  So before I get to the pizza, I'm going to remind you what he said. Because many people [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=556.5s)]
*  can see he's not doing what he said he would do, and often doesn't even seem to be trying [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=560.86s)]
*  to make good on these promises. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=566.0s)]
*  I will immediately bring prices down starting on day one. I'll get the war with Ukraine [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=568.82s)]
*  and Russia ended. If I'm president-elect, I'll get it done before even becoming president. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=574.3s)]
*  But if I win, we will rapidly defeat inflation. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=581.22s)]
*  Look at what's going on in the Middle East. This would have never happened. I will get [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=584.86s)]
*  that settled and fast. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=588.9s)]
*  Starting the day I take the oath of office, I will rapidly drive prices down and we will [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=590.82s)]
*  make America affordable again. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=596.1s)]
*  People remember some of that. He ran on that economic message and look at the economy we're [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=600.98s)]
*  living through. So the surveys capture broad response to that. On the campaign pledges [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=605.42s)]
*  versus the current Trump economy. Worldwide, the influential Economist magazine, which [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=611.46s)]
*  is a right-leaning but pro-markets publication, has this new cover. You can see their view [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=616.08s)]
*  is that Trump's tenure has left America as a kind of battered bandage bald eagle. The [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=622.6600000000001s)]
*  headline, only 1,361 days to go, refers to the end of Trump's last term, of course, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=629.6600000000001s)]
*  the second term. The Constitution bans any president from serving past that second term. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=634.74s)]
*  So fact check, true, that's how many days there are to go. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=639.14s)]
*  Meanwhile the Times writes this headline today on major economic decision, Trump blinks and [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=643.8199999999999s)]
*  then blinks again. It captures something that is a more dire conclusion than where we were [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=649.14s)]
*  on say day one of the presidency where Wall Street and nonpartisan reporters were waiting [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=655.1s)]
*  to see what he did on the economy and trade. Now that is a objective statement. It is literally [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=659.74s)]
*  true that he just keeps blinking because he is widely seen even on Wall Street amongst [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=664.88s)]
*  all the Republicans as a kind of amateurish weak leader in this so-called trade war. And [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=669.76s)]
*  Fox continues to digest Trump's polling slump while his sister outlet, the Journal, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=675.48s)]
*  reports Trump lost. It's basically time to move forward. Quote, China called Trump's [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=679.68s)]
*  bluff and seems to have won this round. It's all sinking in even if the entire kind of [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=684.48s)]
*  blustering PR strategy of this MAGA movement in the Trump White House has been to try to [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=692.48s)]
*  tell you everything you see before your eyes from the falling markets to the failed tariffs [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=697.6s)]
*  to the actual collapsing support for this young honeymoon president. They want you to [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=702.52s)]
*  believe it's not true, but it is. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDkCLgn15A&t=707.44s)]
