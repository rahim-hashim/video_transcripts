# Trump needs to work ‘member by member’ in order to get budget plan through: GOP strategist
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o)
*  Let's bring in right now NBC's Ryan Nobles, who's covering Capitol Hill, and Doug High, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=0.0s)]
*  former RNC Communications Director and Republican strategist. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=4.96s)]
*  Welcome to you both. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=9.08s)]
*  I mean, Ryan, this just went down the last two minutes. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=10.08s)]
*  So let's talk about what happened. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=12.48s)]
*  Give me a sense of the breakdown and what the final numbers were, because I don't even [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=14.96s)]
*  know it yet. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=18.76s)]
*  It just happened. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=19.76s)]
*  Yeah, so I can tell you the final vote was 21 no votes, 16 yes votes, far short of the [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=20.76s)]
*  majority needed for passage. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=27.96s)]
*  And Alex, make no mistake. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=29.52s)]
*  This is a massive setback for House Republican efforts to pass this massive reconciliation [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=31.72s)]
*  package, which is basically the centerpiece of Donald Trump's legislative agenda. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=38.32s)]
*  And what it does more than anything is it lays bare these real disagreements inside [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=43.0s)]
*  the House Republican conference that at this point appear to be immovable. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=48.28s)]
*  What we saw play out in this budget committee hearing was these deficit hawks, these hardcore [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=53.72s)]
*  Republican conservatives who view this opportunity that they have right now as a once in a generation [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=59.32s)]
*  opportunity to get the serious budget cuts that they are looking for. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=65.92s)]
*  And they are running right into moderate Republicans in swing districts, many of these moderate [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=70.32s)]
*  Republicans in states like New York and California, who are in many ways the majority makers for [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=75.8s)]
*  the House Republican caucus, who are very concerned that these budget cuts will ultimately [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=80.72s)]
*  lead to harming their constituents and then losing their elections in the 2026 midterms. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=85.76s)]
*  There's also, of course, a real issue that's playing out in terms of how this tax policy is going to be [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=91.72s)]
*  implemented and how it affects those blue states who are looking for that state and local tax [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=97.0s)]
*  deduction, the cap on that to be increased, which, of course, takes away from revenue coming into the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=102.68s)]
*  government and further increases the deficit. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=108.32s)]
*  So, Alex, I know this is very inside baseball for a lot of our viewers. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=110.75999999999999s)]
*  So we're going to try and make it as common sense as possible. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=114.72s)]
*  This was one step along what is going to be a very, very long process. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=117.92s)]
*  No one thought that this budget that was going to be voted out of this committee today was ultimately [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=122.56s)]
*  going to be the end product. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=127.88s)]
*  But the fact that they are having such a difficult time getting over this procedural hurdle is an [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=129.64s)]
*  indication of just how much more difficult this is going to be going down the road, because at each step [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=135.6s)]
*  along this process, it gets harder. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=141.48s)]
*  And so the fact that they can't even get over this step in the process, it still needs to go through the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=144.32s)]
*  rules committee. Then there needs to be a vote on the floor. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=149.08s)]
*  Then it needs to go to the Senate before it ultimately gets to President Trump's desk just shows how [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=151.32s)]
*  difficult things are for House Republicans. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=156.88s)]
*  Regardless of that, they still remain optimistic. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=159.36s)]
*  This is what the majority leader Steve Scalise said about how they ultimately believe they can get to a [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=162.32s)]
*  final yes vote. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=168.76s)]
*  Keep in mind, though, he said this before the budget went down in the committee today. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=170.04s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=174.0s)]
*  We've had some really good conversations with some of the members of the budget committee. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=176.08s)]
*  We're making a lot of progress. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=180.24s)]
*  You know, a couple of final issues that we're working through right now. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=182.08s)]
*  We've been talking to the administration, the Trump administration on a couple of questions that they had. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=185.64s)]
*  You know, it's timing implementation. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=192.08s)]
*  How long how quickly can we move some of these reforms and get them implemented? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=193.84s)]
*  So, you know, some of them we're working on answers. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=198.64s)]
*  Some of them we need to get answers from the Trump administration. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=201.92s)]
*  But we've got a pretty clear idea of what the final pieces are. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=204.2s)]
*  We're working through those right now. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=208.23999999999998s)]
*  So, as you can see, Steve Scalise admitting that there are a lot of open questions about the way that this [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=211.16s)]
*  reconciliation package would ultimately be implemented, which is part of the reason that you saw many of [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  his House Republican colleagues raise concerns about this and then ultimately vote no. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=222.44s)]
*  They've got a lot of work to do here. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=227.95999999999998s)]
*  And Alex, I think one of the important things to keep in mind prior to this budget vote, we saw President Trump [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=229.6s)]
*  once again take to a social media channel, implore House Republicans to vote for this, telling them not to grand stand. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=234.76s)]
*  There was a group of them that just did not heed that advice from President Trump and still voted no. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=242.72s)]
*  So it just shows that Republicans have a heck of a lot of work to do before they can get this package over the finish line. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=249.64000000000001s)]
*  And keep in mind, it is the bedrock of the Trump agenda. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=255.72s)]
*  And so right now it is on life support. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=259.0s)]
*  Oh, 100 percent. I don't know if the president classifying this as grandstanding is the way it should be classified. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=261.28s)]
*  These are House members who are voting the way they think is best for their constituents. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=266.4s)]
*  Let's keep that in mind. So, Doug, so much riding on this legislation. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=271.48s)]
*  First of all, you surprised that we're at this point. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=276.72s)]
*  And ultimately, how does this bode for its chances of passing? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=279.04s)]
*  No surprise that we have difficulties on this. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=283.64s)]
*  We knew going into it that this vote and the committee was going to be close. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=286.08000000000004s)]
*  We knew that these issues are really tough to reconcile within the Republican conference. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=289.64000000000004s)]
*  And part of that is a result of just having such a narrow majority. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=293.92s)]
*  If they had a 20 seat majority, we're probably not having this conversation. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=299.12s)]
*  And ultimately, you know, as Donald Trump talks about one big, beautiful bill and all of that, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=303.12s)]
*  Donald Trump is the one who's going to have to get this across the finish line. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=308.0s)]
*  It's not going to be the speaker. It's not going to be the majority leader. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=310.8s)]
*  Despite all of the work that they're doing, working their members. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=313.68s)]
*  I think Donald Trump would be much better served putting down the phone to tweet and picking up a real phone [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=317.44s)]
*  and calling those members who voted no in committee today, who voted no in previous committee hearings [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=323.2s)]
*  and are the obstacles for him to get this through. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=328.32s)]
*  Donald Trump needs to work this member by member. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=330.59999999999997s)]
*  He needs to work it hard. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=333.2s)]
*  And when you're tweeting about grandstanding and then tweeting about Taylor Swift and Bruce Springsteen, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=334.64s)]
*  you're not helping your cause. You've got to work your members relentlessly. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGL8aY0cO-o&t=339.56s)]
