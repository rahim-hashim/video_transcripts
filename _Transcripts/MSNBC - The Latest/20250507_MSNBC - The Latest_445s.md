# What is the future of the trade war with China? Business leaders 'need certainty'
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo)
*  Joining us now, NBC News senior White House correspondent Kelly O'Donnell, NBC senior [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=0.0s)]
*  business correspondent Christine Romance, and Axios senior economics reporter Courtney [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=4.84s)]
*  Brown. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=9.32s)]
*  Ladies, great to have you here. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=10.32s)]
*  So Kelly, what more can you tell us about these upcoming talks with China? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=11.76s)]
*  Well, the fact that they're happening is certainly notable. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  And if that sounds like something that might be familiar because you've heard a lot of [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=19.96s)]
*  conversation about China, that is right in the sweet spot because there has been a bit [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=23.52s)]
*  of a divide, a mixed message coming from the administration. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=29.38s)]
*  President Trump has on a number of occasions talked about some level of conversation related [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=33.1s)]
*  to the tariffs going on, as he has talked about wanting to have negotiations, deal making [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=38.78s)]
*  with lots of countries around the world. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=45.019999999999996s)]
*  He has left the impression on a number of occasions and flat out said there were talks [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=47.3s)]
*  happening. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=51.9s)]
*  Now we know that Secretary Besson, the Treasury secretary, will be the first official to engage [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=52.9s)]
*  in direct talks with China over these tariffs. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  And that's coming up in a few days in Switzerland. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  Here is part of what he had to say, sort of setting the table for what to expect. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=64.06s)]
*  What we're going to do in Switzerland is we've agreed to talk. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=71.16s)]
*  Then on Saturday and Sunday, we will agree what we're going to talk about. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=75.2s)]
*  My sense is that this will be about de-escalation, not about the big trade deal. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=78.88s)]
*  But we've got to de-escalate before we can move forward. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=86.9s)]
*  De-escalation is interesting. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=93.22s)]
*  Does that mean that they're looking for some kind of reduction in the tariffs in order [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=94.22s)]
*  to begin having a more constructive dialogue about how they could reorder this relationship? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=98.86000000000001s)]
*  That remains to be seen. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=106.02000000000001s)]
*  But President Trump has said just yesterday in the Oval, talked about the fact that he [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=107.14000000000001s)]
*  would also come down at some point. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=112.18s)]
*  Kelly O'Donnell, thank you. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=116.38000000000001s)]
*  Christine, listening to that sound with the Treasury secretary, it doesn't offer a lot [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=118.54s)]
*  of hope for a breakthrough here, but they're going to be talking. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=122.46000000000001s)]
*  So what will economists and business leaders and investors be watching for or hoping for [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=126.30000000000001s)]
*  in these talks? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=131.3s)]
*  Some clarity, looking for an off-ramp in the escalation, as the Treasury secretary said, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=132.34s)]
*  but also what will things look like in three months or six months? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=136.62s)]
*  We know that port traffic has just cratered, canceled orders, exports and imports down. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=139.78s)]
*  This is very, very disruptive. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=147.14000000000001s)]
*  Business leaders don't know how to plan for the next six months if they don't know what [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=149.16s)]
*  the trade war with China is going to look like. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=152.46s)]
*  So they just need some certainty. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=153.98s)]
*  Recently, the Treasury secretary said that in the near future, the uncertainty will start [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=156.02s)]
*  to go away. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=161.58s)]
*  That's what everyone wants to see. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=162.92000000000002s)]
*  They want to know exactly what's going to happen so they can plan. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=164.58s)]
*  They're talking about talking. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=168.1s)]
*  That's something. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=169.89999999999998s)]
*  That is, at least the door is opening a little bit, a door that had been slammed, closed [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=170.89999999999998s)]
*  and locked for some weeks now. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=174.94s)]
*  Courtney, even if the two sides do de-escalate at this meeting, that's still a big if. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=177.14s)]
*  You highlight that there have been some major economic impacts already in motion. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=182.56s)]
*  Christine touched on this as well, particularly when it comes to America's ports. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=186.78s)]
*  Walk us through what you're learning. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=191.82s)]
*  I think the economic data, like the jobs report, like the retail sales report, the things [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=194.34s)]
*  that economists look at to gauge the temperature of the economy are not reflecting what Americans [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=200.20000000000002s)]
*  are reporting in closely watched surveys. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=206.38000000000002s)]
*  Americans are afraid of inflation igniting. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=209.82000000000002s)]
*  They're afraid of shortages on the shelves, which the administration has conceded to in [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=213.42000000000002s)]
*  one form or another with President Trump's comments about Americans maybe not needing [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=218.54000000000002s)]
*  as many dolls as they're used to having. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=223.98s)]
*  They're also worried about the labor market. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=227.57999999999998s)]
*  If businesses don't know what's coming next, it makes it really difficult for them to plan, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=230.94s)]
*  to hire, and if they're worried about their businesses being able to survive this period [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=236.85999999999999s)]
*  of de-escalation, as the Treasury Secretary calls it, it's possible that they might start [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=243.45999999999998s)]
*  to shrink their workforces. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=248.89999999999998s)]
*  Let's talk about what came of President Trump's sit down with Canadian Prime Minister Carney [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=250.86s)]
*  yesterday. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=254.42000000000002s)]
*  I want to highlight a key moment where Carney essentially fact-checked Trump on the spot. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=255.42000000000002s)]
*  Watch. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=260.62s)]
*  Well, we don't do much business with Canada from our standpoint. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=263.62s)]
*  They do a lot of business with us. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=266.98s)]
*  We're at like 4 percent. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=269.34000000000003s)]
*  We are the largest client of the United States in the totality of all the goods. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=270.90000000000003s)]
*  So we are the largest client of the United States. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=276.5s)]
*  We have a tremendous auto sector between the two of us. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=278.8s)]
*  Just to put a pin on President Trump's claim about not doing much business with Canada, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=283.44s)]
*  Canada is the top buyer of U.S. goods, America's number three supplier. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=287.6s)]
*  Christine, did anything come of this meeting yesterday? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=292.76s)]
*  Any progress? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=295.36s)]
*  Well, Mark Carney was quite deft there, I think. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=296.36s)]
*  He is a politician. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=299.12s)]
*  He's also a businessman and a banker, right? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=300.12s)]
*  So the way he appealed to Donald Trump with real estate analogies, too, was quite deft [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=302.48s)]
*  there. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=308.92s)]
*  But the president is waging a trade war with kind of false premises. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=309.92s)]
*  He thinks that trade deficits are actually the U.S. losing money, that there's a winner [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=314.84s)]
*  and that there's a loser, when really the global system is much more complicated than [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=319.68s)]
*  that. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=324.52s)]
*  And then the U.S. does gain a lot from Canada. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=325.52s)]
*  We spoke yesterday about Canadian crude that is critical for so many different kinds of [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=327.8s)]
*  products that the U.S. makes in manufacturing, right? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=331.88s)]
*  So the United States does rely heavily on Canada, and Canada does buy a lot of stuff, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=335.20000000000005s)]
*  especially services from the United States. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=341.16s)]
*  So that fact check on the spot was quite interesting. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=343.04s)]
*  Courtney, today we're looking ahead now to the next Fed interest rate decision expected [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=346.44s)]
*  in the next few hours. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=351.8s)]
*  What do you expect to see? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=353.72s)]
*  And I have to wonder if there's any political pressure being a factor for Jerome Powell [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=354.92s)]
*  here. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=359.84000000000003s)]
*  Yes, the countdown is on. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=360.84000000000003s)]
*  I'm getting ready to head over to the Fed in a few hours to cover the interest rate [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=362.68s)]
*  decision. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=366.24s)]
*  Wall Street overwhelmingly expects that the Fed will keep interest rates on hold. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=367.24s)]
*  The question is what is the Fed is thinking about with respect to the months ahead. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=372.68s)]
*  Do they see interest rate cuts on the horizon? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=379.08s)]
*  That is, of course, what President Trump would like to see. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=382.72s)]
*  I think the question is, does Fed Chair Jerome Powell move at a pace that the president wants [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=385.56s)]
*  to see? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=391.88s)]
*  Of course, that's not a consideration at all for the Fed. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=392.88s)]
*  They are an apolitical institution. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=395.35999999999996s)]
*  It is sort of ironic that, you know, the Fed might be interested, would have been interested [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=397.56s)]
*  in cutting interest rates if it wasn't for President Trump's tariffs. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=405.0s)]
*  We were looking pretty good on the inflation front. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=409.96s)]
*  The labor market was holding up. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=412.59999999999997s)]
*  There was this environment that would have been perfect to cut interest rates, but now [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=414.47999999999996s)]
*  this trade war has reignited inflation fears, and the big question is how the Fed is going [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=419.12s)]
*  to handle that. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VET1j22xo&t=424.44s)]
