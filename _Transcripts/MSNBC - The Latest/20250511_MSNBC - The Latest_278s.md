# SCOTUS has ‘nudged’ Trump along during expansion of power, executive immunity: Law professor
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA)
*  In our Constitution, judges and the judiciary is a co-equal branch of government, separate [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=0.0s)]
*  from the others, with the authority to interpret the Constitution as law. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  Its job is to obviously decide cases, but in the course of that, check the excesses [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=12.32s)]
*  of Congress or the executive, and that does require a degree of independence. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=19.6s)]
*  Lots of applause there for Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, defending the independence [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=26.2s)]
*  of the judiciary. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=34.68s)]
*  Thursday, the court will hear oral arguments on a series of nationwide injunctions preventing [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=35.96s)]
*  the Trump administration from enforcing an executive order ending birthright citizenship. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=40.92s)]
*  Leah Lippman is back with me. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=46.16s)]
*  Her new book comes out Tuesday, Lawless, How the Supreme Court Runs on Conservative Grievance, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=47.76s)]
*  Fringe Theories, and Bad Vibes. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=52.84s)]
*  Leah, welcome back. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  Thanks for sticking around. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=56.519999999999996s)]
*  First of all, how do you interpret the Chief Justice's remarks? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  What does he mean when he says a degree of judicial independence is required to act as [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  a check on excesses? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=66.75999999999999s)]
*  The reality is our Constitution strikes a balance between independence and accountability. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=69.44s)]
*  So, for example, the Supreme Court justices are appointed by elected politicians, and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=74.0s)]
*  they are confirmed by elected senators. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=78.67999999999999s)]
*  They're also subject to impeachment. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=80.88s)]
*  Congress also makes decisions about the scope of the court's authority, their jurisdiction, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=82.64s)]
*  and their funding. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  On the other hand, they can hold office during good behavior. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=88.24s)]
*  And so the Constitution itself balances between independence and accountability, which is [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=91.32s)]
*  what I think the Chief Justice was gesturing toward when he said it requires some independence, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=95.84s)]
*  not complete independence. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=100.32s)]
*  You say the Supreme Court is responsible for Trump's interpretation of expanded presidential [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=102.52s)]
*  power and that readers can learn more about this in your book. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=107.12s)]
*  What are you getting at here? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=109.76s)]
*  So, in the immunity opinion, the Supreme Court relied on something that people call the unitary [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=113.16000000000001s)]
*  executive theory, the idea that the Constitution vests all of the executive power in the single [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  president, and therefore the president has vast sweeping authority over who to fire or [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=124.0s)]
*  how to carry out investigations and prosecutions, so much so that the president can fire people [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=130.16s)]
*  in violation of federal laws. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=135.26s)]
*  And it's that idea that the Trump administration has seized on to justify their authority to [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=137.5s)]
*  fire the members of the National Labor Relations Board or to suggest that the president has [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=142.66s)]
*  the constitutional authority to summarily expel people without due process. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=147.98000000000002s)]
*  So the Supreme Court has, I think, nudged Donald Trump along in this expansive vision [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=153.02s)]
*  of executive power that John Roberts was writing about back when he was a lawyer in the Reagan [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=158.70000000000002s)]
*  administration. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=163.98000000000002s)]
*  So part of what I do in the book is trace the development of these ideas from Republican [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=165.06s)]
*  political circles to political talking points and then show how the Republican justices [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=170.54s)]
*  have kind of legitimized those talking points as law. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=176.02s)]
*  So do you see the Supreme Court functioning as an institution designed to uphold democracy? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=179.74s)]
*  In an ideal world, the Supreme Court would intervene when our political process has broken [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=186.34s)]
*  down to protect democracy. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=191.6s)]
*  But as I argue in the book, I think the Supreme Court has very much done the opposite. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=193.52s)]
*  So they have dismantled key laws that actually safeguarded our democracy, like Section 5 [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=197.84s)]
*  of the Voting Rights Act. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=203.56s)]
*  That law used to prevent jurisdictions with especially bad histories of racial discrimination [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=205.12s)]
*  from enacting voting laws or policies before clearing them with the federal government. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=210.68s)]
*  The Supreme Court said that preclearance system couldn't stand, and they declared it actually [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=215.28s)]
*  unfair, unconstitutional discrimination against the former Confederacy. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  And part of what I argue in the book is it really takes a lot to take cases involving [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=225.64000000000001s)]
*  racial discrimination and somehow turn the former Confederacy into the victims of those [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  cases. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=236.0s)]
*  And it's that grievance mindset that is driving so much of the Republican justices' case [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=237.0s)]
*  law. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=242.52s)]
*  Well, the book is Lawless, How the Supreme Court Runs on Conservative Grievance, Fringe [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=243.52s)]
*  Theories and Bad Vibes. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=248.48000000000002s)]
*  Heck of a very catchy title. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=251.32s)]
*  Thank you so much, Leah, for joining us. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=253.44s)]
*  Best of luck with the book. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=254.88s)]
*  It comes out Tuesday, everybody, so check it out. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=255.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTnvoa4K8fA&t=257.88s)]
