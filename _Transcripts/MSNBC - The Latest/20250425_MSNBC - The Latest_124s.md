# Luigi Mangione pleads not guilty to federal murder charges
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR1fMJciijQ)
*  Luigi Mangione, the 26-year-old accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR1fMJciijQ&t=0.0s)]
*  was in federal court today where he just pleaded not guilty on federal murder and stalking [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR1fMJciijQ&t=5.7s)]
*  charges. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR1fMJciijQ&t=10.94s)]
*  It's his first hearing since prosecutors formally filed plans to seek the death penalty. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR1fMJciijQ&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  Joining me now is NBC's Tom Winter. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR1fMJciijQ&t=17.18s)]
*  Tom, what's the latest you're hearing out of court? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR1fMJciijQ&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  Well, Chris, the idea that he would plead not guilty to these charges and specifically [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR1fMJciijQ&t=21.52s)]
*  now that they carry capital offenses, the Justice Department has said previously and [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR1fMJciijQ&t=26.48s)]
*  has now formally told the court that they intend to seek the death penalty in this case. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR1fMJciijQ&t=30.92s)]
*  What was interesting is that now Mangione's defense says he wants the federal trial to [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR1fMJciijQ&t=36.68s)]
*  go first. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR1fMJciijQ&t=41.16s)]
*  You remember, he's under indictment by state prosecutors in the Manhattan District Attorney's [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR1fMJciijQ&t=42.16s)]
*  Office also for the same alleged crimes and offenses under state statutes, obviously. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR1fMJciijQ&t=46.28s)]
*  And so now they said that they want the federal case to go ahead because they think that some [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR1fMJciijQ&t=51.879999999999995s)]
*  of the facts and things that could come up potentially in the state case could harm the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR1fMJciijQ&t=54.98s)]
*  federal trial, which obviously now has the additional burden for them for his defense [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR1fMJciijQ&t=59.98s)]
*  of knowing that this is a capital case. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR1fMJciijQ&t=66.66s)]
*  So I think that's really kind of the big news out of this today. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR1fMJciijQ&t=68.3s)]
*  It appears that there's going to be a lot of motions going back and forth and that the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR1fMJciijQ&t=72.0s)]
*  next time all the parties are expected in court is December 5th, although of course [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR1fMJciijQ&t=75.02s)]
*  that could change depending upon the developments in the case. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR1fMJciijQ&t=78.66s)]
*  But that's the most significant development. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR1fMJciijQ&t=81.58s)]
*  The idea initially, apparently, according to our colleague Adam Reese's reporting, there [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR1fMJciijQ&t=83.34s)]
*  had been some sort of a handshake agreement, he says, between Mangione's defense and the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR1fMJciijQ&t=88.46000000000001s)]
*  Justice Department of the Biden administration that the state would go first. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR1fMJciijQ&t=92.58s)]
*  That would kind of be the process here. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR1fMJciijQ&t=96.14s)]
*  Now they're saying, look, we want this federal case, which has the death penalty attached [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR1fMJciijQ&t=97.86s)]
*  to it potentially, to go first instead. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR1fMJciijQ&t=101.38s)]
