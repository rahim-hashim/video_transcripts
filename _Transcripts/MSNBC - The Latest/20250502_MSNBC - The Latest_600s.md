# China says its open to engage in trade talks with U.S. as businesses brace for tariffs
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY)
*  Joining us now, NBC News senior business correspondent Christine Romans, Jared Bernstein, former [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=0.0s)]
*  chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Biden, and Sabrina Rodriguez, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=4.96s)]
*  national political reporter at The Washington Post. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=9.92s)]
*  So, Christine, take us to this jobs report. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=12.32s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=14.96s)]
*  What are the things that stand out to you? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=15.96s)]
*  Look, I mean, the labor market is still resilient, and I think that's really important considering [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=16.96s)]
*  all of the questions about how the president's trade strategy is going to ripple through [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=21.48s)]
*  the economy overall. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=26.48s)]
*  So you've got 177,000 jobs created. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=27.72s)]
*  You've got health care jobs created. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=31.4s)]
*  You've also got, you can see, warehouse and transportation jobs in here. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=32.839999999999996s)]
*  I think that's directly tied to his tariffs because you had a lot of frontloaded companies [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=36.76s)]
*  rushing in inventories, and so there were jobs probably surrounding that. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=41.36s)]
*  But when you look in federal jobs, 9,000 lost, 26,000 federal jobs lost so far this year, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=45.84s)]
*  you'll start to see that number grow. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=51.44s)]
*  And here's why. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=54.72s)]
*  There have been a lot of government layoffs, and anybody who took a buyout or is furloughed [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=55.92s)]
*  from the government and is still getting a paycheck, for example, if you had a buyout, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=61.08s)]
*  you're not counted yet. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=65.28s)]
*  So there could be a lag before those numbers really start to show up here. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=66.32000000000001s)]
*  So this is the kind of a number that really shows the durability of the American job market [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  with all of this uncertainty swirling around. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=75.48s)]
*  Jose? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=77.88s)]
*  And, Christine, so it's interesting because for so long, I would venture to guess probably [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=78.88s)]
*  if not decades, a lot of the economic growth in jobs was in the federal government part. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=85.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=93.08s)]
*  I mean, yes, indeed. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=94.08s)]
*  And that has been a part that has been a sturdy, you know, some economists and labor economists [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=95.08s)]
*  would call it kind of like a shock absorber. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=99.56s)]
*  This is a part of the labor market that's a shock absorber when times turn because you [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=102.04s)]
*  have this steady, solid part of the economy, the labor force that is employed, and this [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=106.0s)]
*  is the president and his team. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=111.56s)]
*  They don't want that anymore. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=113.24s)]
*  So they've been aggressively firing American workers. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=114.24s)]
*  So that number will will begin to change. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=118.0s)]
*  No question. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=121.39999999999999s)]
*  And I will say, Jose, also, over all these numbers, these are not the gangbuster numbers [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  of the past couple of years. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=125.47999999999999s)]
*  These are it's a steady cooling in a resilient labor market. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=126.88s)]
*  This is exactly what the Fed wants to see. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=130.56s)]
*  And Jared, when you were in the Biden White House, you were always so kind to come and [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=133.51999999999998s)]
*  speak to us when these jobs reports came out. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=138.88s)]
*  So today, outside of the White House, I ask you, give me your take on them. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=142.44s)]
*  This is a solid jobs report. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=149.08s)]
*  It came in better than expected. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=150.4s)]
*  The underlying pace of job growth is around one hundred and fifty thousand per month, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=152.4s)]
*  as Christine correctly noted. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  That's not like the gangbuster numbers that we were posting when I was around. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=158.0s)]
*  But that was in part just recovering back from, of course, the very deep pandemic induced [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=163.08s)]
*  recession. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=168.12s)]
*  The key factor right here is that one hundred and fifty thousand jobs is enough to keep [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=169.58s)]
*  the unemployment rate pretty low. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=173.34s)]
*  It's enough to provide opportunities for people looking for work. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=174.98s)]
*  And we actually saw a nice tick up in people coming into the job market. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=178.18s)]
*  So all told, this is this is a good job market. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=181.3s)]
*  But I happen to have been listening to your show for a while now this morning. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=184.7s)]
*  I've heard just one negative anecdote after another from business people. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=189.06s)]
*  And I happen to believe what they're saying. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=193.06s)]
*  This trade war is hurting them. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=195.3s)]
*  Now, they say in economics that the plural of anecdote is data. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=197.57999999999998s)]
*  Well, not yet. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=201.34s)]
*  Not in the jobs numbers yet. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=202.26s)]
*  We saw some of that in the GDP numbers. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=204.22s)]
*  But if this trade war persists at this magnitude, it will impact the job market. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=206.5s)]
*  But it hasn't yet. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=211.54s)]
*  And so, Jared, is there something to what? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=213.42s)]
*  And, you know, President Trump has been talking about the reorganization of the world economic [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=217.34s)]
*  order, right? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=223.34s)]
*  But is this jobs number also showing the reorientation of how jobs and where jobs are [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=224.38s)]
*  created? Because the fact is, as Christine was telling you, that when you have actual [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=234.7s)]
*  diminishment, diminishing federal jobs and you include that in the formula and then you [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=240.26s)]
*  get these numbers, is that also part of a changing shift? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=247.14000000000001s)]
*  I wouldn't say so in the sense that, you know, there's two and a half million federal [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=251.74s)]
*  workers in a job market of 160 million people. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=256.54s)]
*  Now, those layoffs that we're talking about are, I think, quite destructive and certainly [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=260.14s)]
*  very tough for the people who are facing them. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=265.34000000000003s)]
*  But I would not call what President Trump is engaged in any sort of seriously global [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=267.74s)]
*  restructuring. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=273.82s)]
*  This is him acting out of his just very deep antipathy towards imports, towards trade, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=275.38s)]
*  towards our trading partners. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=282.02s)]
*  It's far more chaos than any sort of organized plan. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=283.42s)]
*  Look, this is kind of an Occam's razor moment. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=286.62s)]
*  We have a strong job market that has been in place for many years, generating real wage [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=289.62s)]
*  gains to consumers in an economy that's 70 percent consumer spending. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=295.02s)]
*  Consumer spending is holding up. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=299.42s)]
*  The economy is holding up. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=301.02s)]
*  The economy is holding up for now. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=303.22s)]
*  And Sabrina, so this week we saw the Ukrainian minerals deal. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=307.42s)]
*  Beijing is now signaling it's open to trade talks. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=310.42s)]
*  What that could look like. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=314.22s)]
*  No one knows. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=315.82s)]
*  This better than expected jobs report. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=316.82s)]
*  How's the White House feeling in all of this? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=319.42s)]
*  The White House, we're seeing them definitely feel a little boosted by the jobs report today. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=323.02s)]
*  We're seeing them feel some relief to see that, OK, maybe some contours of deals are [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=327.42s)]
*  coming together. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=332.42s)]
*  But the reality is that we're a long ways away from these deals coming to fruition, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=333.42s)]
*  particularly with China. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=338.02000000000004s)]
*  And we see that we're a month after today, May 2nd, a month after Trump said that he [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=340.42s)]
*  was Liberation Day, imposing all these tariffs. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=346.82s)]
*  A few days later, announced that he was putting a pause on the majority of those tariffs. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=349.62s)]
*  He said it was a pause for 90 days. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=354.62s)]
*  And he's talking about making trade deals with all these countries that he paused those [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=356.72s)]
*  tariffs on. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=361.42s)]
*  To do these deals in 90 days is incredibly difficult, I think, for folks who I covered [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=362.62s)]
*  trade policy for years. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=369.62s)]
*  So the idea that I spent a year covering just the negotiations between U.S., Canada and [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=371.12s)]
*  Mexico, and we're going to do deals with, you know, dozens of countries in a matter [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=376.12s)]
*  of weeks, is very hard to envision. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=380.52000000000004s)]
*  And the reality is, given that, there's just so much uncertainty about the future of the [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=382.82s)]
*  tariffs and just how much that could really impact Americans if we're already feeling [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=388.21999999999997s)]
*  impacts with the limited ones that have gone into effect. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=391.92s)]
*  And Christine, let's talk about that, because this new tariff on auto parts set to take [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=395.92s)]
*  effect tomorrow, what kind of impact is that going to have? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=400.92s)]
*  Well, look, I mean, the North American auto industry is heavily reliant on goods and services [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=403.71999999999997s)]
*  from Canada and Mexico and everywhere around the world, right? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=410.71999999999997s)]
*  So now the president has sort of stepped back and instead of all of these tariffs stacking [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=414.32s)]
*  on top of each other, these auto tariffs, there'll be a way to have a rebate for what [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=418.82s)]
*  you're paying for the auto parts tariffs. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=423.02s)]
*  It's a complicate, you know, I have to tell you, for an administration that has talked [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=425.62s)]
*  about cutting red tape and being more laissez-faire to business, there is so much red tape around [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=430.21999999999997s)]
*  these tariffs, it's a little bit counterintuitive, but it's a whole new structure here for them [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=434.71999999999997s)]
*  to figure out how to tax the parts of a car. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=439.42s)]
*  And we, the economists that, even after all these, you know, changes from the White House, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=443.82s)]
*  are saying $2,000 to $12,000 extra for the price of a car, probably $300 extra, according [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=449.02000000000004s)]
*  to one estimate, for the insurance that you pay for your car because of higher prices. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=454.62s)]
*  So tariffs eventually mean higher prices, and now it's just how much higher? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=459.02000000000004s)]
*  That's what everyone's trying to figure out. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=463.22s)]
*  Yeah, and Jared, now we're being told that Mark Carney, the new prime minister of, you [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=465.21999999999997s)]
*  know, of Canada, has just announced that he would be traveling to Washington next Tuesday [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=470.42s)]
*  to meet with President Trump. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=475.82s)]
*  We've been seeing that Claudia Scheinbaum, the president of Mexico, as more, as recently [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=477.74s)]
*  as yesterday, was talking about their continuing series of conversations between high-level [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=483.38s)]
*  officials of the Mexican government with the United States. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=489.98s)]
*  And I'm just thinking, Jared, you know, the USMCA and somebody, and I was referring to [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=494.14000000000004s)]
*  this, you know, it took more than a year of intense negotiations. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=498.38s)]
*  Now that's been essentially made moot by these tariffs. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=502.98s)]
*  What kind of impact does that have on the most important, in many ways, trading partner [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=507.90000000000003s)]
*  that the United States has, which is Mexico, and of course, Canada as well? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=513.9s)]
*  Yeah, I very much agree with the importance there. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=517.9s)]
*  The car production system that we think of as a US car production system, it's really [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=521.78s)]
*  a North American car production system, and it's one that's been working well for a long [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=525.7s)]
*  time. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=529.9399999999999s)]
*  So I've been very disheartened to see these tariffs slapped on Mexico and Canada, even [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=530.9399999999999s)]
*  though there are exemptions for the USMCA deal. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=536.54s)]
*  Look, any time Trump is talking to foreign leaders about dialing back his very destructive [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=539.62s)]
*  trade policy, I consider that to be a good conversation worth having. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=546.5400000000001s)]
*  I happen to believe that this administration, maybe not all of them, but the people who [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=551.34s)]
*  I think have their heads screwed on most straight, are looking for off-ramps where they can [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=554.74s)]
*  find them. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=559.02s)]
*  I'm talking about Besant. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=560.02s)]
*  I'm talking about probably Lotnik. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=561.02s)]
*  And frankly, Trump himself on alternate Wednesdays, depending on what the market is doing. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=563.0600000000001s)]
*  So if these meetings are an off-ramp opportunity, a dialing back opportunity, that's going to [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=568.82s)]
*  be good for car producers, for North American trade, and ultimately for the economy. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b7vt5B_mjY&t=574.46s)]
