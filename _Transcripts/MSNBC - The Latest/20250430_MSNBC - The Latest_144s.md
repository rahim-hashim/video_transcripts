**MSNBC - The Latest:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg)
*  We're just covering before the break. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=0.0s)]
*  We are learning now a federal judge in Vermont [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=2.0s)]
*  has ordered the immediate release [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=4.96s)]
*  of this Columbia University student, Mohsen Madawi. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=7.72s)]
*  You can see he is outside the courthouse. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  These are live images right now as he's speaking. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=12.68s)]
*  Madawi was detained at his citizenship interview. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=15.08s)]
*  Here's a little of what he had to say [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=17.68s)]
*  as he was leaving the courthouse. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=19.76s)]
*  Let's listen in. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=20.8s)]
*  I love you too. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=24.28s)]
*  Ah! [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=25.48s)]
*  I've always learned that home is where you feel safe [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=26.32s)]
*  and loved and those who surround you there are your people [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=31.32s)]
*  and you are my people. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=35.76s)]
*  Welcome home! [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=36.96s)]
*  Woo! [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=37.8s)]
*  We'll continue to hear and listen to that news conference [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=42.16s)]
*  that he's holding right now outside the courthouse. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=45.04s)]
*  Bring you more sound from him. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  Let's bring back MSNBC legal analyst, Annie Savalos. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=48.56s)]
*  Now as we continue to look at these live pictures, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=51.64s)]
*  this is a breakthrough moment as we've seen case after case [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=53.76s)]
*  involving students who are here legally [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=57.76s)]
*  with visas of some sort being detained. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=60.36s)]
*  Now a judge is saying he's gonna go free. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=63.0s)]
*  Well, go free is a qualified term [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=65.6s)]
*  because it looks like this was a release [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=67.64s)]
*  under a case called what's called Matt v. Reno [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=69.6s)]
*  and Khalil also another student filed a motion similar. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  So what it means is since 2001, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=76.0s)]
*  the Second Circuit has held that somebody [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=78.0s)]
*  who files for habeas relief, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=80.36s)]
*  they can be granted bail pending the outcome [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=82.16s)]
*  of the habeas petition. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=84.75999999999999s)]
*  They have to make a showing essentially a three part showing [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  that they're likely to win basically, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=88.36s)]
*  that there's a real issue involved [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=90.32s)]
*  and it would really help their habeas petition [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=92.0s)]
*  to be released on bail. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=93.8s)]
*  So what I believe has happened here [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=95.55999999999999s)]
*  is that the judge has granted that. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  I didn't see anything on the docket yet. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=98.83999999999999s)]
*  That's not unusual. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=100.44s)]
*  It takes a few minutes to upload to ECF [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=101.28s)]
*  but in all likelihood, what we're seeing here [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=103.88s)]
*  is that he's been granted bail pending his habeas petition. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=106.3s)]
*  It is not truth. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=110.08s)]
*  It is freedom. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=111.32s)]
*  You are exactly right. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=112.16s)]
*  It is freedom in the sense that anything out of custody [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=113.11999999999999s)]
*  is freedom and it really improves your chances [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=115.91999999999999s)]
*  of winning your case. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=118.66s)]
*  But he's not out of the woods yet. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=119.83999999999999s)]
*  He's not out of the immigration woods yet so to speak. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df4rDGQLxgg&t=121.6s)]
