# Is a Chinese invasion of Taiwan ‘imminent’ like Hegseth says?
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM)
*  Also new today, the other big story, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth urging allies in Asia [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=0.0s)]
*  to be prepared after calling China an imminent threat to Taiwan. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=5.32s)]
*  So let's bring in NBC News national security reporter Gordon Lubold. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=10.32s)]
*  Gordon, welcome. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=13.76s)]
*  What does Hegseth mean by saying that China threat could be imminent? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=14.96s)]
*  I mean, he doesn't attach any kind of a timeline to the word imminent. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  So how do you interpret all of this? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=22.16s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=24.28s)]
*  Good afternoon. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=25.28s)]
*  There's a couple things there. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=26.28s)]
*  I think this is this Secretary of Defense's first kind of or one of his first big international [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=27.68s)]
*  trips. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=34.6s)]
*  I think he's trying to make kind of different kind of headlines than the ones that we've [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=35.6s)]
*  seen of about him in recent weeks. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=39.96s)]
*  Are we pertaining to other things that we can talk about? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=43.2s)]
*  But I think this is it's not clear that this is new intelligence or anything in that way. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=46.28s)]
*  in the region, in Singapore, trying to sound the alarm to the region to say a threat from [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=53.36s)]
*  China is real. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=59.56s)]
*  We've heard for years about the effort to kind of focus on that region and the kind [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=61.44s)]
*  of realities of the world keep getting in the way, the Middle East, Europe, Ukraine, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=67.24s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=72.03999999999999s)]
*  And so I think he's just really trying to kind of sign an alarm bell. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  It's not clear that China is anywhere near some kind of an invasion that we know of. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=77.32s)]
*  The notional view is that he, President Xi would do something after 2027. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=83.32s)]
*  So we're still a little ways out. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=91.63999999999999s)]
*  OK, so the top of what you said, though, the implication being that he's trying to present [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=93.32s)]
*  himself as someone to be taken seriously and trying to present an impressive front, basically, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=97.44s)]
*  and defy, as you refer to, past headlines. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=102.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=106.16s)]
*  So as viewers may be following, the Secretary of Defense has had some problems with not [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=108.16s)]
*  only the kind of signal gate issues where reporters put on a chat and Hegseth himself [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=114.03999999999999s)]
*  put the kind of very sensitive military operational information on that chat and that was shared [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=122.44s)]
*  with a reporter inadvertently. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=127.88s)]
*  But he's also had a lot of drama around his senior staff. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=131.2s)]
*  He abruptly fired three senior aides and removed his own chief of staff. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=136.68s)]
*  And now, over the last many weeks, has not been able to replace those people. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=141.44s)]
*  And some of this drama has drawn attention to the White House. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=147.68s)]
*  And they're now working to try to kind of smooth it over. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=152.8s)]
*  But I think in some ways, this is an effort to kind of erase or drown out some of those [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  concerns and say, here I am, a serious person on the world stage. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=162.12s)]
*  I mean, point well taken, hard to eliminate the memory of that Atlantic article, that's [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=166.12s)]
*  for sure, in the fallout. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=170.2s)]
*  So let's talk about the U.S., which has ratcheted up its rhetoric and actions, in fact, against [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=171.64s)]
*  China in the last couple of days on the terror front, the China student visa front as well. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=176.76s)]
*  Does this latest rhetoric from Hegseth, does it serve as a further warning of sorts to [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=182.28s)]
*  China? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=187.28s)]
*  Yeah, I think it certainly does. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=188.28s)]
*  Despite what we just said, I think that it's effective in putting another, as I say, warning [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=192.20000000000002s)]
*  sign, sending a signal to Beijing that the U.S. is serious on all these different fronts. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=200.04000000000002s)]
*  How they'll react is unclear. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=207.32000000000002s)]
*  The other thing I would say, though, about the defense secretary's remarks is, you know, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=210.28s)]
*  Trump is clear that he really doesn't want war anywhere. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=218.32s)]
*  He talks a lot about peace through strength, and that is, in effect, is what Hegseth is [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=222.96s)]
*  talking about. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=228.28s)]
*  But the kind of strong rhetoric that we heard from there today seems a little bit out of [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=230.28s)]
*  sync with the way Trump would like to portray the world order. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=238.68s)]
*  I think they want to send a strong signal to China, but they also don't want to suggest [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=245.92s)]
*  that, you know, we're about to go to war. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=250.44s)]
*  OK. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=252.44s)]
*  Let me quickly get to the new NBC News exclusive, in which you and some of our colleagues, Gordon, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=253.44s)]
*  are reporting. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=258.03999999999996s)]
*  National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard is considering ways to revamp Trump's intelligence [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=259.03999999999996s)]
*  briefing. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=264.47999999999996s)]
*  What does a revamp mean, and why does she think this is necessary? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=265.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=269.64s)]
*  So the PDB, as it's known, the Presidential Daily Briefing, is a highly classified briefing [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=270.76s)]
*  that presidents typically choose to take on different intervals, typically every day, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=277.47999999999996s)]
*  not always. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=283.08s)]
*  This president has taken, I think, 14 times since the inauguration in January. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=284.08s)]
*  But what I think Gabbard is trying to do is just to—and this is often done—essentially [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=289.56s)]
*  tailor this document, this product, this intelligence product, to suit the consumption [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=296.56s)]
*  desires of this president, which is fine. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=303.56s)]
*  You know, make it into a document that—or into a product that he will absorb and listen [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=307.28000000000003s)]
*  to. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=315.48s)]
*  The PDB is very important because how it is framed and what is included in it really does [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=316.48s)]
*  have an effect on how the president sees the world, literally. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=324.72s)]
*  And so I think what they're trying to do and what my colleagues and I reported early this [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=328.0s)]
*  morning was that they wanted to make it so it would be something that he could consume [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=333.70000000000005s)]
*  and absorb. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=339.08000000000004s)]
*  Yep. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=340.08000000000004s)]
*  Well, it's important he digest it. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=341.08000000000004s)]
*  That is for sure. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=342.08000000000004s)]
*  We thank you for all you gave us to digest, Gordon. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=343.44s)]
*  See you again. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=345.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=346.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uICY1XY9mM&t=354.48s)]
