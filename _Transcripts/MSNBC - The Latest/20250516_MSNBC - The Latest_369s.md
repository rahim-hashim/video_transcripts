# AG Pam Bondi sold $1 million in Trump Media stock day of Trump tariff announcement
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM)
*  Just after President Trump's sweeping tariff announcement last month, you might remember [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut warned that anyone who had advanced knowledge of [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=4.32s)]
*  Trump's plan to upend the global economic order could stand to benefit financially. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=10.0s)]
*  The bottom line is that the chaotic nature of this tariff policy, with Trump's position [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  changing every single hour, gives ample opportunity for any individual who has early access to [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=24.5s)]
*  information about the White House's change in position to make boatloads of money, either [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=32.82s)]
*  by investing at the right time or pulling their money out of the market at the right [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=38.74s)]
*  time. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=44.78s)]
*  Those comments come as new mandated government financial disclosure forms show Attorney General [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=46.78s)]
*  Pam Bondi sold between $1 million and $5 million worth of Trump media shares on April 2, the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=53.06s)]
*  very same day President Trump announced those tariffs. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=59.78s)]
*  NBC News reached out to the Justice Department with questions on Bondi's stock trades. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=64.26s)]
*  They declined to comment. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=69.54s)]
*  Let's bring in one of the writers who broke the story on Bondi's sales, money and politics [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=71.06s)]
*  reporter for ProPublica, Robert Federici. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=75.18s)]
*  Robert, we should know Bondi said she'd sell this stock within 90 days of becoming AG, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=78.18s)]
*  so her deadline would have been May 4. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=83.82000000000001s)]
*  So this sale falls within that window, but it's the timing on this exact day that's raising [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=86.02000000000001s)]
*  questions. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=92.26s)]
*  Could it just be coincidental that the sale came just before President Trump's tariff [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=93.74000000000001s)]
*  announcement that tanked the markets? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=98.38000000000001s)]
*  It definitely could be. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=102.10000000000001s)]
*  A lot of insider trading investigations start exactly that way. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=105.14s)]
*  You see a trade that is perfectly timed and you dig in deeper and you find out that for [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=110.89999999999999s)]
*  whatever reason it was just a coincidence, right? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=119.25999999999999s)]
*  So one question we had was did she have control over the timing? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=122.14s)]
*  Did she have advanced knowledge of how severe the tariffs that were announced on Liberation [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=127.54s)]
*  Day were going to be? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=135.06s)]
*  It's been now something like 36 hours since we reached out to the Justice Department and [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=136.5s)]
*  to the Attorney General, and we've gotten none of those explanations. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=142.38s)]
*  We have not heard back. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=146.38s)]
*  Walk us through what you do know and what you don't know. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=147.78s)]
*  So what we know is that on April 2nd, she sold between $1 and $5 million in shares of [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=151.54s)]
*  Trump Media, which is the president's social media company. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=158.9s)]
*  Also, that's the exact same day after the stock market closed, the president from the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=162.94s)]
*  White House had a press conference where he announced his Liberation Day tariffs. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=172.78s)]
*  The market was reeling afterwards. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=178.1s)]
*  Trump Media fell 13% in the days that followed, and by selling on April 2nd, the attorney [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=181.62s)]
*  general avoided those losses on what was a massive stock sale. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=189.22s)]
*  So do we know what kind of losses she might have avoided? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=194.7s)]
*  Up to 13% of that $1 to $5 million. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=199.54s)]
*  So we're not talking about a small amount of money here. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=203.45999999999998s)]
*  You report it's unclear whether the attorney general had any knowledge of this tariff announcement [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=206.5s)]
*  coming, but would an AG typically be involved in tariff discussions? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=212.82s)]
*  So oftentimes when one part of the executive branch is rolling out a policy, other parts [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=220.58s)]
*  of the executive branch, other agencies will be consulted. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=227.98s)]
*  There's an interagency process. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=232.1s)]
*  And also, just like any other workplace, there's all sorts of informal conversations. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=235.26s)]
*  So that is one of the questions we posed to the attorney general. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=240.57999999999998s)]
*  Did she have any advanced knowledge of how severe these tariffs were going to be? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=245.26s)]
*  Obviously, everyone knew the president was going to announce these tariffs on April 2nd, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=249.89999999999998s)]
*  but the market up until that point had assumed that the tariffs were not going to be as severe [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=255.18s)]
*  as they ultimately were, which is why the market plummeted. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=261.08s)]
*  And so the question is, what did she know? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=264.78s)]
*  When did she know it? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=266.85999999999996s)]
*  What were the details that she had, if she had any additional details before this announcement? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=268.02s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=273.14s)]
*  We're, our understanding is that this trade that she made was signed off by two people [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=274.14s)]
*  from the Office of Government Ethics. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=279.82s)]
*  What does that office do? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=282.5s)]
*  Are the people working their career public servants or political appointees? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=283.5s)]
*  Their career public servants is my understanding. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=289.46s)]
*  We have seen government officials make trades in the past, right? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=294.78s)]
*  So the most notable example being Richard Burr, right? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=300.02s)]
*  The senator from North Carolina who is chairman of the Intelligence Committee. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=303.58s)]
*  He dumped massive amounts of stock a week before the coronavirus stock market crash. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=308.0s)]
*  And of course, as a senator on the health committee, and he had been receiving briefings [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=314.26s)]
*  about the coming coronavirus crisis. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=322.1s)]
*  And so what happens under normal circumstances when there is a suspiciously timed trade like [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=326.06s)]
*  this is there will oftentimes be an investigation by the SEC or the DOJ afterwards to figure [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=332.06s)]
*  out exactly what the person knew when they made that trade. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=338.5s)]
*  I don't know if we're going to see that here. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=342.6s)]
*  All right, we'll say stay tuned. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=344.38s)]
*  Robert Federici, thank you for joining us. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqVBtW60rM&t=346.82s)]
