*  61% disapproving [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=21.36s)]
*  Joining us now Michael Hardaway former spokesman and communications director for leader Hakeem Jeffries. It's great seeing you my friend [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=23.96s)]
*  Appreciate your time. So what do you see in this because these polls seem to be? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=29.64s)]
*  Going the wrong direction for the president on something that was so vital and important for his victory in this last time [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=35.6s)]
*  The ceiling is collapsing on Donald Trump and I'll tell you why of course you expect Democrats [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=43.24s)]
*  To not be happy with his performance in the first hundred days. Of course Republicans are happy with his performance. However [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=48.36s)]
*  68% of independents are unhappy with his performance [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  And what does that mean for the midterms in the last election? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=58.16s)]
*  You had 80 races that were decided by 10 points or fewer. Those are moderate states and districts [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=61.63999999999999s)]
*  You had 11 in the Senate 69 in the house [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=67.22s)]
*  That's what that's how this is going to reflect itself [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=69.92s)]
*  You've got 69 percent of independents who are now happy with Trump [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=72.67999999999999s)]
*  That means that in the midterm elections Republicans get wiped out if something doesn't change [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=76.36s)]
*  You know, it's interesting because it seems as though there is a common [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=81.08s)]
*  I guess understanding that almost a tradition right that the first [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=86.27999999999999s)]
*  midterms after a president's term starts tends to be disastrous for [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=91.8s)]
*  shellacking to use [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=98.19999999999999s)]
*  former President Obama's terms for the power the party in power, but that did not happen [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=99.8s)]
*  under Biden and so do you think that there is a trend there or is it just [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=106.24s)]
*  With these numbers things don't look good for Republicans [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=112.0s)]
*  There's no turning back and I'll tell you why the economy which is the primary thing people elected Donald Trump on is only getting worse [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=115.44s)]
*  Gas prices are higher milk prices are higher basic items all cost more and to the point that was just made in the previous segment [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=122.16s)]
*  You have this trade war that he started. It's going to make it even worse [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=129.0s)]
*  And so look people already don't have money budgets are already tight [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=132.24s)]
*  Prices are skyrocketing under this president and voters will make him a Republicans pay next November [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=136.76000000000002s)]
*  I want to bring back my friend former Congressman Carlos Curbelo [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  Carlos how [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=147.08s)]
*  Concerned do you think the Trump administration should be about these numbers? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, they should be concerned hosted because the economy was the number one issue in the last election [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=154.60000000000002s)]
*  The president himself has recognized that he won thanks to that issue the Biden administration really struggled explaining to the public why [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=161.4s)]
*  The economy was better than what people actually felt and what we're seeing from the polling is that people still feel [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=170.32s)]
*  Like they're struggling, but I think you made an important point [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=178.0s)]
*  It doesn't have to be the case that the party in power [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=181.6s)]
*  Gets receives a shellacking in the midterm election. They can [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=186.94s)]
*  Change that they do have agency and a lot of the economic [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=192.38s)]
*  Pain that the country is experiencing in ways has been self-inflicted by this terror policy [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=197.54s)]
*  So that's why I think you've seen some congressional Republicans asking the administration to rethink this strategy and the administration [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=203.42s)]
*  The president has the power at any time to pivot and say, you know what this strategy wasn't working the way we thought it would [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=210.85999999999999s)]
*  So we're gonna take a different course and that would bring a lot more certainty back [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=217.7s)]
*  To to the economy and it would help people feel better so they can [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=222.38s)]
*  Change course and avoid a shellacking in the midterm election and Michael this weekend your former boss Ikeem [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=228.06s)]
*  Jeffrey so the stage they sit in on the Capitol steps with other [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=234.94s)]
*  Senators including Chuck Schumer and a senator from New Jersey was there as well in protest of the GOP funding plan [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=239.02s)]
*  Do these kinds of events? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=245.46s)]
*  Make a difference it matters and I'll tell you why voters are pissed off and [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=247.9s)]
*  Democratic members of Congress are hearing from their voters every single day who are saying you have to do something now [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=252.86s)]
*  Look, this is one piece of a ripple Corey Booker had the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=258.12s)]
*  25-hour [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=262.58s)]
*  Right, so he had that and then he came and Corey had this event yesterday [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=264.5s)]
*  Look at it away as a way of building sort of in the resistance against Donald Trump and doing something meaningful [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=269.82s)]
*  I don't think it has a sort of changed the world in one minute [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=276.18s)]
*  But I do think it's part of a larger effort for Democrats to fight back. Have you seen this larger effort? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=279.74s)]
*  Actually becoming larger. Well, yeah, look at the town halls across the country not just in Democratic districts [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=287.62s)]
*  But Democrats going into Republican districts and people are pissed off Democrats independents Republicans. They all want action [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=292.88s)]
*  They all want people to step stand up to Donald Trump and that's what Democrats are doing [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=300.23999999999995s)]
*  So yes, the energy is there and the will is there [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=304.67999999999995s)]
*  You [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ZLKWfFOLM&t=322.84s)]
