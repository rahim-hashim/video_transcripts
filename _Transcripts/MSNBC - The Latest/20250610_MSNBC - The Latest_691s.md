# ‘Fabricated crisis’: Retired General reacts to Trump's deployment of troops to L.A.
**MSNBC - The Latest:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o)
*  In the meantime, I want to bring in NBC's David Noriega in Los Angeles. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=0.0s)]
*  Melanie Zanona is covering Capitol Hill. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=4.2s)]
*  Retired Army four-star general Barry McCaffrey is an MSNBC military analyst. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  And with us in the studio, former Pennsylvania Republican Congressman Charlie Dent. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=11.68s)]
*  He's also the executive director of the congressional program at the Aspen Institute. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=15.4s)]
*  General, I want to start with you and whether you agree with the decision to send in the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=19.6s)]
*  Marines or not. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=23.88s)]
*  The governor says most of them literally don't have anything to do, and he sent this message [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  to the president last night. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=29.64s)]
*  Rescend this absurd, illegal and immoral order. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=32.6s)]
*  Let our military go home. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  The absurdity of threatening the people of the United States of America with their own [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=40.52s)]
*  military, our proud military. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=45.96s)]
*  Mr. President, show some decency. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  Show some humanity. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=51.6s)]
*  More importantly, act like the commander in chief. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=52.6s)]
*  Stand back and we'll clean up your mess. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=56.68s)]
*  So, General, I want to ask you what you make of the decision to send in the Marines in [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=59.92s)]
*  general, but also is that decision the president's to make? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=63.16s)]
*  Well, look, there's deadly serious political theater going on right now. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=66.76s)]
*  Trump ran for office saying he was going to close the border, which he has, and he was [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=73.12s)]
*  going to deport 10 million illegal migrants in the United States, crashing the agricultural [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=77.68s)]
*  construction service industry, et cetera. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=85.88s)]
*  It's not even remotely going to happen. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=88.64s)]
*  It certainly won't happen with due process for millions of people. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=90.44s)]
*  So what's going on right now is a standoff between a political standoff, a tremendous [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=94.44s)]
*  hysteria on both sides on are we going to support crashing the economy by deporting [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=101.28s)]
*  10 million people or not. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=108.28s)]
*  That's really what's at stake. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=110.56s)]
*  Now, in the short run, 4000 National Guard federalized is surprising. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=112.36s)]
*  Bringing in the Marines is surprising. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=119.55999999999999s)]
*  So far, they're not engaged with the demonstrators. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=121.55999999999999s)]
*  They're guarding federal property, which he's fully in authority to do. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=124.32s)]
*  So I think this is largely a fabricated crisis by both sides. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=128.95999999999998s)]
*  And, Melanie, I want to ask you that hearing on the Hill with Secretary Hegseth today was [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=135.56s)]
*  supposed to be about the budget. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=139.04s)]
*  But, of course, given the politics the general just mentioned, it was mostly about this. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=140.84s)]
*  What did we learn about the mobilization of these National Guard units? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=145.08s)]
*  What authority is being used? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=148.60000000000002s)]
*  Anything else that stood out to you? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=150.44s)]
*  Yeah, the secretary was asked about this right out of the gate by Democrat Betty McCollum. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=152.28s)]
*  She's a Democrat from Minnesota. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=157.04000000000002s)]
*  And she asked the secretary, how much is it going to cost to deploy the troops and deploy [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=158.8s)]
*  these Marines into California? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=164.16000000000003s)]
*  And she also asked whether any other training or critical duties were impacted as a result. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  But Hegseth did not provide a cost estimate. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=171.35999999999999s)]
*  He did not directly answer the question. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=173.51999999999998s)]
*  And instead, he largely pivoted to attacking Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and how he handled [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=175.6s)]
*  the protests over George Floyd in 2020. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=181.07999999999998s)]
*  Let's watch some of their exchange. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  ICE ought be able to do its job, whether it's Minneapolis or Los Angeles. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=187.12s)]
*  Chairman, I have limited time. I asked a budget question. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=190.92s)]
*  Could the secretary please address the budget? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=192.79999999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=194.64s)]
*  You asked about the situation in Los Angeles, and we believe ICE agents should be allowed [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=196.32s)]
*  to be safe in doing their operations. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=201.2s)]
*  And we have deployed National Guard and the Marines to protect them in the execution of [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=203.16s)]
*  their duties. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=207.72s)]
*  And Hegseth was also asked by California Democrat Pete Aguilar about the legal justification [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=209.95999999999998s)]
*  for Trump's decision to federalize these National Guard troops into California. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=215.88s)]
*  Again, he seemed to largely dodge the question itself, but he did offer a forceful defense [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=220.44s)]
*  of the president. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=225.64s)]
*  No doubt something the president himself might be looking out for later today. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=226.83999999999997s)]
*  But this is just one of several hearings that Hegseth will appear for on Capitol Hill, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=229.76s)]
*  his first appearance since his testy confirmation battle and since a lot of these [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=234.35999999999999s)]
*  controversies that have really marked his tenure as secretary. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=237.72s)]
*  Christina. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=240.32s)]
*  Thanks, Melanie. And turning away from the rhetorical fireworks for just a second, David, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=241.51999999999998s)]
*  I want to ask you, how are things on the street? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=245.27999999999997s)]
*  What are you actually seeing today? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=247.76s)]
*  And how is it compared to what we've seen the last several days? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=249.27999999999997s)]
*  Well, look, right now it's quiet. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=251.76s)]
*  It's still relatively early here. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=254.51999999999998s)]
*  Things don't usually pick up until late morning, early afternoon. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=255.67999999999998s)]
*  But it's tense. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=259.52s)]
*  A lot of people are expecting the possibility that things might once again, you know, kind [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=260.76s)]
*  of take off as the day proceeds. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=265.36s)]
*  But I can I want to talk to you about what happened yesterday because it was pretty [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=267.8s)]
*  remarkable in one way. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=270.08s)]
*  The scale and intensity of the law enforcement presence in response to the relatively small [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=271.76s)]
*  and relatively scattered protests that we saw yesterday, the number of people who were [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=277.32s)]
*  that we saw in this downtown area yesterday was completely overwhelming. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=281.6s)]
*  I have covered protests in a lot of different places over the years and I have never seen [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=285.44s)]
*  a law enforcement presence like this one. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=289.16s)]
*  Just in terms of how much it actually pretty substantially outnumbered the protesters [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=291.24s)]
*  themselves. This was law enforcement from the LAPD, from the L.A. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  County sheriffs, from the California Highway Patrol and from a number of other law [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=299.32000000000005s)]
*  enforcement agencies around Southern California. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=303.32000000000005s)]
*  They came out in full force. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=305.56s)]
*  You know, a show of force is not doing justice to what the police officers did yesterday. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=307.67999999999995s)]
*  Now, in response, I think I have to attribute this to that law enforcement presence. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=312.59999999999997s)]
*  The protests that we saw yesterday were substantially less confrontational, smaller and [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=316.4s)]
*  more scattered than the ones we saw on Sunday. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=321.0s)]
*  Sunday, for example, we saw people go down the freeway on ramps onto the one to one block [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=322.96s)]
*  traffic for an extended period of time. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=326.84s)]
*  We didn't see anything like that yesterday, in part because police created a pretty much [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=329.23999999999995s)]
*  impenetrable barrier between where protesters were gathered and anywhere near the freeway. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=332.92s)]
*  Ditto most of the federal buildings that are part of the complex that you see behind me [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=338.0s)]
*  right now. Those, by the way, are National Guard vehicles. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=341.52s)]
*  And I don't know if you can see any of the actual National Guard troops behind me, but [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=344.52s)]
*  they're out there in relatively small numbers because that's where they've been posted [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=347.64s)]
*  for the last two days since they were deployed on Sunday. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=352.12s)]
*  Now, the question today, I think, looking ahead to the next few hours, is whether the [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=355.4s)]
*  deployment of the Marines will instigate more protests. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=359.36s)]
*  I spoke to a number of protesters yesterday who told me that they are very unhappy with [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=362.96s)]
*  the fact that Trump is deploying the Marines. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=367.04s)]
*  They see it as an escalation of this sort of ongoing confrontation. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=368.68s)]
*  They see it as a step towards authoritarianism, a step further than the deployment of the [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=372.44s)]
*  National Guard troops already on Sunday. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=376.96s)]
*  Whether, though, whether enough protesters come out to to sort of escalate the situation [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=378.88s)]
*  back to the level that we saw on Sunday is very much an open question. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=384.96s)]
*  And I definitely expect that we'll see as big or even more of a deployment of local [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=388.0s)]
*  and state and county law enforcement here in the downtown area, because it's really at [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=392.88s)]
*  this point that the sort of stakes for Mayor Karen Bass, for Police Chief McDonald, for [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=397.6s)]
*  Governor Newsom is to show the world and to show the president that they do not need, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=401.4s)]
*  as they are saying, that they do not need the Marines in the city to control the situation, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=406.6s)]
*  that they don't even need the National Guard troops that have already been deployed to [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=409.64s)]
*  control the situation. Just last thing I'll say, it's important to remind people the [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=412.8s)]
*  footprint of this activity in downtown L.A. is quite small. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=416.24s)]
*  L.A. is a massive city. We're not seeing anywhere near the kind of unrest that we saw in the [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=419.48s)]
*  90s or have seen in some instances, you know, after the Dodgers win the World Series. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=423.0s)]
*  This is a matter of a few blocks in downtown L.A. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=426.88s)]
*  Police have more than enough numbers to control, as we saw yesterday. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=429.44s)]
*  Again, it depends on how much things escalate, but that's a little bit what the balance is [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=432.88s)]
*  looking like on the ground, Christine. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=436.64s)]
*  Thank you, David. And, Congressman, you heard him talk about controlling the situation, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=438.96000000000004s)]
*  but I want to ask you about controlling the messaging, because it seems like whereas [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=442.88s)]
*  previous administrations, both Republican and Democrat, would try to avoid conflicts, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=446.8s)]
*  this is the fight the White House is happy to have. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=450.36s)]
*  In fact, a White House official tells NBC News, quote, We are happy to have this fight. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=452.88s)]
*  And Politico Playbook today is calling it a fight Trump wanted. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=457.44s)]
*  You've also got the National Review saying, quote, Trump has no downside here. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=461.36s)]
*  Do you agree with that? Well, I tend to agree that Trump does want the fight. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=466.2s)]
*  And you're right. Most presidents would try to defuse tensions. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=470.28000000000003s)]
*  Trump likes to accelerate them. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=474.68s)]
*  He's an accelerant. He loves having this conversation. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=477.32s)]
*  We're not talking about the economy right now. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=480.72s)]
*  And the problem, of course, with his opponents is, you know, they're playing right into his hands. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=482.36s)]
*  Well, that's what I was going to ask you. Is he winning this? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=486.56s)]
*  Well, I think he is on a political level. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=488.72s)]
*  He's winning it. What's so sad about it is that, you know, we should be hearing from state [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=491.24s)]
*  and local law enforcement if they need the National Guard to be called up. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=495.28000000000003s)]
*  They should reach out to the governor or the White House and then the Marines. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=499.52000000000004s)]
*  I mean, now the Marines, I mean, posse comitatus. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=502.96000000000004s)]
*  I mean, we have to think about that a little bit. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=506.08000000000004s)]
*  I mean, that's clearly an escalation. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=508.04s)]
*  And so but right now, I think Trump likes having this debate all day, every day. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=511.08000000000004s)]
*  He loves talking about this, although he could actually claim victory that, you know, the [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=516.0s)]
*  number of illegal border crossings and people abusing the asylum system is way down. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=519.24s)]
*  He can claim success. But now he's like he just loves having this fight and he's going to [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=523.44s)]
*  continue doing it as long as everybody's going to keep covering it because he thinks he's [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=528.48s)]
*  winning when people are standing out there. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=531.88s)]
*  Some people are throwing things at the police and waving Mexican flags. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=534.12s)]
*  Right. That image of the flag on the motorcycle in front that we're going to see over and [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=538.28s)]
*  over and over again. You're going to see that. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=541.48s)]
*  And so Trump's winning with that. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=543.16s)]
*  And frankly, I think a lot of American people don't like don't like those images either. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=544.76s)]
*  General, I want to ask you as someone who spent your life in the military, you know, we [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=549.6800000000001s)]
*  were just talking about posse comitatus, which is trying to keep the civilian and military [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=553.2s)]
*  branches of the U.S. government separate. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=556.72s)]
*  There's a there's an important role soldiers have and are taught to stay out of politics and be [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=560.0s)]
*  loyal to the Constitution, not a person or a party. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=564.1600000000001s)]
*  Do these actions by the president, in your opinion, blur that line? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=567.32s)]
*  And if so, what are the potential consequences? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=570.2s)]
*  Well, I think the underlying principle, both constitutional and sort of the values of [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=573.4s)]
*  America is we don't want the U.S. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=577.84s)]
*  Armed Forces involved in domestic law enforcement, period. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=579.72s)]
*  We don't want them investigating, arresting, gathering evidence. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=583.4s)]
*  That's the heart and soul of the posse comitatus act. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=588.08s)]
*  At the same time, a lot of Americans don't understand. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=591.28s)]
*  Nineteen seventy six, the Presidential Emergency Powers Act, there are some hundred and thirty [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=594.44s)]
*  seven emergency powers granted to the president that he can act on without congressional [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=601.44s)]
*  approval. There's thirty ongoing declared national emergencies. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=608.2s)]
*  They're staying in place. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=613.4000000000001s)]
*  And so certainly, in my view, he has full authority to carry out military operations, for [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=616.2s)]
*  example, to protect federal property. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=624.0s)]
*  But much of this is political theater. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=627.0400000000001s)]
*  Obviously, the LAPD, a first rate law enforcement organization, the L.A. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=629.24s)]
*  County Sheriff's Department have more than enough manpower to handle the situation. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=635.12s)]
*  But again, Christina, in the background, are we going to allow the Trump administration to [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=640.0400000000001s)]
*  deport 10 million people? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=645.4000000000001s)]
*  Can they even do it? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=647.32s)]
*  Can they do it with due process in the court system? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=648.36s)]
*  The answer is no. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=651.9200000000001s)]
*  But this, I think, from a political perspective, is what both President Trump wants and [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=654.0s)]
*  Gavin Newsom here, daring federal authorities to arrest him. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=660.32s)]
*  There's a certain element of political immaturity and risk taking on both sides. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfrx_-G7-o&t=664.04s)]
